          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_5">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">In December 2006, the Government approved a major review of the public service by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD.  The review has two main objectives, namely, to benchmark the public service in Ireland against comparable countries and, to make recommendations as to future directions for public service reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">A twin track approach is being taken to the review, namely, a review of the key institutional dimensions in the public sector as a whole and five case studies examining key questions in specific areas including, health and local government services.  The terms of reference of the review have been published and are available on the Department's website.  A high level steering group of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General of my Department is overseeing the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">While the review is not a detailed audit of individual sectors such as health, education, local government and so on, it is examining the effectiveness of arrangements through which Government objectives are translated into outputs and outcomes.  It is focusing on the connections between the different sectors including, the links between Department offices and local government, health and education sectors with particular focus on the delivery of quality public services.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">Separately, a major public consultation undertaken by my Department included an invitation to the general public, social partners and all interested parties to make submissions.  My Department has also facilitated dialogue between the OECD and a consultative panel.  For the OECD to develop this holistic approach to reviewing the public service as an entity and to apply it in the first instance to Ireland, we have increased our contribution to the OECD on a once-off basis by €490,000 to be paid over the two years 2006 and 2007.  I expect the review to be completed by the end of the year and to be published early in 2008.  Regarding quality customer service in the public service, the development, promotion and implementation of this initiative has been driven in recent times mainly by two groups: the QCS officers' network and the QCS research group.The QCS officers' network continues to work intensively on the development and promotion of a range of customer service issues, including promotion of the customer charter approach.  This is an important initiative whereby public service organisations publicly commit to service standards and report on progress made.  The QCS officers' network has met four times so far this year and is due to meet again in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">Similarly, the QCS research group has been active and was involved last year in the development of a major survey of customer satisfaction levels and attitudes towards Civil Service Departments.  The research group has met three times so far this year and is due to meet again shortly to discuss the next such customer surveys, which are planned to begin before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">A new task force on customer service has also been established to look at the further development of customer charters and various commitments to customer service in the programme for Government.  This task force, which is made up of senior officials from Departments, offices and agencies, is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and will bring forward proposals on how best to enhance and deepen the quality of customer service in key front line areas of the Civil and wider public service.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_12">Someone spent a long time writing out that answer for the Taoiseach.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">Before the recent general election, the Taoiseach proclaimed, more than once, that we had world class public services.  In early May, he said, "I am not saying this tongue-in-cheek or in a light-hearted way, but I should really have people congratulating me on the health service".  The Taoiseach went on to say that "people are immensely happy with the health service".  He should tell that to some of those who are on waiting lists or suffering as a consequence of the cutbacks by the Health Service Executive.  If our public services were world class in early May, why has it been necessary to call in the OECD to review them and bring about world class public services?</p>
            <p eId="para_14">The benchmarking review group is due to report soon.  Will the OECD look at benchmarking?  I would be the first to say public servants deserve to be well paid for the job they do.  The vast majority work exceptionally hard.  Will the OECD do what the benchmarking group did not do, which is set out tangible targets and performance indicators so that the public will know what improvements are achieved following increases in pay?  This issue was fudged on many occasions although, as Deputy Sargent pointed out many times from this side of the House, benchmarking has brought no tangible efficiency benefits and achieved no objective targets which the public can identify.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">Has the OECD been given the remit of examining benchmarking?  Following its report, will we be able to get what we did not get from the benchmarking process, despite frequent questioning in the House?  Will tangible targets and objectives be set so the public can see where their tax is being spent and how public services are benefitting?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_16">The OECD review was undertaken last year.  The work has been going on for the better part of a year.  The report is not simply on the public service.  It is the first comprehensive review ever undertaken on the public service as a system.  It is holistic and is a service-wide assessment.  It will identify many things but it has two main areas in its remit.  It will examine how the Irish public service compares with other services that are recognised as representing good practice in various aspects of public management, using the unique insights of the OECD in its field.  However good we are in areas, other people are good in other areas and we should always examine how we can improve services and systems across Departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">The second issue under consideration is how the different parts of our system relate to each other, for example, the relationship between central and local government and how objectives are translated into actions.  It is examining the health and education sectors to see if there are better ways in which common issues such as child care and social inclusion can be tackled.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">As I mentioned, a large number of groups are involved on a consultative basis and are giving their views.  Some are international figures, including people from OECD headquarters and others who can bring fresh thinking, and they are talking to the leaders in the field.  They have also engaged with the political system and have been talking to the chairpersons of various committees of the House, such as the Committee of Public Accounts and the health and education committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">Individual sectors and parts of the public service have been reviewed in the past but last year it was felt it was time to take stock of the system as a whole with a view to making recommendations on the future direction of the public service in supporting the Government's drive for delivery of world class services and contributing to the sustainable national competitive advantage.  Deputy Kenny would have seen the research findings of a detailed survey of 3,500 patients in the hospital system published some weeks ago.  This showed clearly the satisfaction of patients with the health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">Benchmarking was introduced to replace relativities and numerous old systems.  It was made clear at the beginning that benchmarking was never intended to be a once off exercise, but a process that would be repeated at appropriate intervals and that is happening at present.  Benchmarking is an exercise that examines the pay and conditions of similar jobs in the public and private sectors with a view to determining whether the pay levels of public service jobs should be altered.  In this way, public service pay can be determined by comparison to real and competitive market demands.  It is necessary to ensure that the public service can continue to attract and retain a high calibre of staff with necessary skills to provide an excellent service to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">I believe benchmarking is a substantial improvement on the old pay determinants in a system that operated from 1946 and was based on relativities.  If one grade got an increase for whatever reason, that was followed by other grades leapfrogging and catching up based on no factual outcome.  This was the system that existed for the better part of 60 years and it led to industrial disputes and unrest across the public service from 1946.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">The second benchmarking group was established in January of last year.  It is chaired by Dan O'Keeffe, SC, and is due to report at the end of this year.  It comprises a number of eminent individuals from the public and private sectors and from the world of academia and will undertake a fundamental examination of the pay of public servants <i>vis-à-vis </i>the private sector.  There are no predetermined outcomes.  If there is little movement in the private sector salaries, then the same will happen to public service salaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">In response to the question from Deputy Kenny, the benchmarking body seeks to ensure the optimum level of transparency in carrying out its work.  Following issues that were raised after the last benchmarking process, we made the point on the need to ensure the process is consistent, effective and transparent.  As has been pointed out to me by all the people involved, there is a need to handle some of the information in a confidential way in an exercise of this nature.  The body can only do its job if it receives the information from the private sector and the system is based on using confidential commercial information.  It cannot publish everything it receives, but it is conscious of being as transparent as possible.  I understand the benchmarking body will consider practical steps to examine the level of transparency, having regard to its remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">It is not true that previously the productivity measures to be delivered by public servants were not validated.  In each Department and area they were validated and the benchmarking body reported on that basis.  Although I accept there were issues in some areas, in most areas the body produced a very detailed report.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_25">Does the Taoiseach still stand by the statement he made last May that people should congratulate him on the state of the health services and that the vast majority of Irish people are happy with the health services?</p>
            <p eId="para_26">The Taoiseach mentioned that the OECD will examine a number of relationships.  Will it examine the relationship between the taxpayer and the consumer in the context of increased efficiencies and better service in the public service?  The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, referred to people ringing local authorities and being instructed to press button five or 12 or whatever.  From that perspective does the Taoiseach accept that, despite the volumes written and the amount of paper shredded within the benchmarking process, the benchmarking body failed ultimately to set out for members of the public, for taxpayers, many of whom are themselves public servants, any real and tangible benefits, any demonstrable advantages on foot of which they could say they are happy to pay their taxes because they get a level of public service which complies with best practice?  That did not and does not happen in many cases.  Vague generalities were published but there was no validation of tangible benefits.  Members on this side of the House asked Minister after Minister to cite three areas in their Department where there was increased service to the public consequent on the benchmarking process.  In every case the answer was negligible or complete waffle.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the benchmarking process did not set out tangible benefits for the public?  Is the OECD now going to move into that space and make recommendations in regard to what should be done in various Departments?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_27">Deputy Kenny and I regularly discuss problem areas in the health service.  It is not me that people should congratulate.  They should congratulate the staff in the health services.  Across a large part of our health services, including cardiac surgery, children's cardiac surgery, liver transplants and maternity services, we are up there with the very best.  We have eminent teams of consultants and other medical staff.  More than 3,500 people were surveyed, far more than normally would be surveyed in consumer and political surveys, and it showed the level of satisfaction in percentage terms is approximately from the mid eighties to the early nineties.  Of 52 accident and emergency departments, there are problems in half a dozen, or eight or ten at times.  However, across the health sector, we have a service of which we can and should be immensely proud.  There are problems in some areas and we must continue to provide resources and work to resolve these.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">In regard to benchmarking, I have no difficulty with consistently seeking transparency showing why increases should be given, which should be the basis of it.  Where there is movement in pay in line with the public or private sector, issues should be agreed and put forward.  In the last programme, Towards 2016, it was agreed to build on previous achievements in the modernisation of the public service to provide more responsive better quality customer services, which is happening, and better management of performance both individually and organisationally.  There is better financial and human resource management right across the Civil Service, although that might not apply to the entire public service.  The Civil Service has implemented new financial management and human resources systems that are far better than they were even five years ago.  There is also a greater flexibility to openness and change, including the extension of opening hours so that services open earlier in the mornings and later in the evenings.  The Civil Service has reformed the system to widen the use of open recruitment to take account of the requirements of a modern public administration and the age profile of civil servants.  It has taken some years but that is the difficulty with industrial relations.  Co-operation has been introduced in the form of shared services between public and related organisations and there are many other areas where initiatives have been taken.  Some believe public servants should do these things as a matter of course and should not be paid for them but that is not the way the system works.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">A huge number of technology-related issues emerged from the last benchmarking discussions.  Access to services has been enhanced through information technology and there is now 24-hour access to information in the Civil Service and other public services.  The motor tax on-line system came directly from discussions involving local authorities.  In the area of agriculture, food e-services were developed for livestock registration, identification and movement, which has been hugely important to farmers and those involved in the food sector throughout the country.  The Revenue on-line service is considered probably the best in the modern world and has been studied and followed by others.  There has been huge progress in the area of social welfare, where 1 million payments per week can now be made in a very efficient way.  Other initiatives relating to the General Register Office and visa office came out of the benchmarking process.  The single farm payment scheme was sorted out on the basis of people committing themselves, in benchmarking negotiations, to doing things in a different way.  The scheme used to be a very difficult area and Members, particularly those from rural areas, will remember all the difficulties we had with agricultural payments in previous years.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">If Deputy Kenny asks me whether there is much more that can be done then my answer is "Yes" — I readily admit that.  A huge amount of change is still necessary and many new initiatives will be required in the next round.  If any Ministers stood up in the House and said they could not remember three benefits in their own Departments they must not have asked the question but I do not believe that to be the case.  There has been a huge amount of progress in every Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_32">We should not give too much credence to the Taoiseach's remarks last May that people were happy with the health services.  It is eminently possible that, given the number of people with whom the Taoiseach engages, a number may have expressed such a view but I do not know what they are talking about.  Deputy Kenny might reflect for a moment on the comment by the Minister for Health and Children, who apparently spoke to somebody on a trolley in an accident and emergency unit who described the experience as comfortable and happy.  Can the Taoiseach give any credibility to that claim?</p>
            <p eId="para_33">Is there a cut-off point for the strategic management initiative in its present form?  It was supposed to improve services to the public from Departments and it is arguable that it has performed the task to some degree.  However, it has also produced a lorry load of long-winded reports.  In his response today the Taoiseach talked about examining effectiveness and efficiency but how effective and efficient is the whole exercise?  Should improved services to the public, including greater access to and understanding of the role and function of Departments, not be part of the ongoing review Departments are undertaking into matters within their own ambit?  Can the Taoiseach give us a sense of where the strategic management initiative stands at this point in time?  How long does he see it continuing in its current form?  Can he also indicate what improvements he would like to see in its work?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_8">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_34">I am talking about the Civil Service and not the wider public service, although there have been huge improvements in the latter as well.  My Department is involved in driving the quality service initiatives.  The sections in my Department that deal with this, deal with people across the Civil Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">For several years, the Civil Service has had declining numbers in the overall management system.  It was given a target of 3% in recent years and most areas have achieved it.  It is constantly taking on extra work and functions while reducing staff.  As a country, our Civil Service is small.  It is very small on a <i>pro rata</i> basis compared to most other countries.  In fairness to civil servants, it is because they have worked particularly since 1992 to strategically manage their area and to focus on their customers, evaluating what their customers require while taking on a huge amount of services and technology.  New technology was embraced with little or no industrial problem or unrest, as has occurred in many other countries.  Whether the issues involved relate to business, farmers, the social partners or the general public, the reviews carried out by independent organisations have demonstrated that although the service is not perfect, it has exhibited a constant rate of improvement.  That does not mean there are not many other issues to be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">With regard to where we should go, the QCS research group has been involved in overseeing the management of the recent evaluation of customer charters.  Fitzpatrick Associates, the economic consultants, have been engaged to undertake this evaluation independently and they have now put out their survey.  The QCS networks are also overseeing a process of promoting customer charters in the wider public service.  These charters exist to spell out what staff are doing, how they are doing it and to report on how they got on with it.  These are published every year and people can examine them.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">Staff are also involved in the Public Service Excellence Awards, the final ceremony of which I have attended along with many others in this House.  Individual public servants and civil servants who bring in new efficiencies in their areas can put ideas up for awards.  Although awards are not everything, this shows an interest in being able to take a new project and deliver a better service to the public.  Many Members have attended the final ceremonies of these awards, where we have seen some 20 schemes put up for case study.  There is much happening in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">An example of what is ongoing at the moment is that in the health sector, the feasibility of implementing an advisory charter of patients rights, similar to the European charter, is being examined.  In the agricultural sector there is a commitment to monitor outcomes being delivered under the farmers' charter and to modify it in light of new findings.  There is a commitment in the justice area for the introduction of a Garda charter, setting out targeted Garda response times and the level of service the public can expect.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">As part of the significant commitments in local government, there is a commitment to put customer service to the fore and develop a customer charter.  There are many other areas now being developed to bring about what the public require, with staff challenging themselves to deliver the service.  In most cases such action is not easy.  Much of the easier work is probably finished and the technology has been implemented.  Key personnel of the Civil Service, including the commissioner and other senior civil servants such as the head of Revenue and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, are working on these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">There is a genuine effort to make a good attempt to build on what has been done in recent years and to improve the service to the public.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_9">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_41">I have listened to the Taoiseach answering these questions for the past half hour and I confess I am still unclear on the reason the State is to pay another €500,000 for another study on the public service from the OECD.  Among the various other studies that have emerged are that published earlier in the year by the NESF, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, published in June, which states that problems remain in a number of State agencies regarding value for money, the benchmarking report and the strategic management initiative.  As the Taoiseach indicated earlier, there is also the work being done by the QCS research group, Fitzpatrick Associates and the QCS officers' network.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">Is it now time to stop studying the public service and to start reforming it?  What does the Taoiseach expect the OECD to tell us that we have not already been told in many of the reports published heretofore?  The NESF report indicates that there is often a wide gap between what public service providers believe they are providing and what people actually receive.  Does the issue at hand not revolve around narrowing that gap?  Is the latter not what Ministers are supposed to be doing?  If, for example, there is a gap between what the public service believes itself to be doing and what people actually want, is it not the responsibility of Ministers to ensure that line Departments and agencies under their remit deliver what was originally envisaged?</p>
            <p eId="para_43">Why are we continuing to study the public service?  Is this merely some kind of substitute for inaction on the part of Government to introduce the reforms required?  Some of these reforms are extremely simple in nature.  I refer, for example, to putting in place staff to answer telephone calls instead of requiring members of the public to push various buttons, be transferred from one voice message to another and not have access to a facility whereby they could talk to someone who might assist them with minor queries?  In a country with a population of just over 4 million, it should not be impossible to organise the public service in a way which makes it accessible and which ensures that it delivers that for which people are paying.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_10">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_44">I will answer the second part of the Deputy's query first.  Most of these systems and schemes have been in place since the period 1992 to 1997, the year when the Public Service Management Act was introduced.  Reforms relating to Revenue customer charges and those that brought about improvements to the social welfare system, improved services for pensioners, replaced the mess that used to be the agricultural scheme and facilitated the introduction of the motor tax on-line system and the registration offices, have all been fully implemented.  A host of other reforms of a very high standard have been introduced in every area of the public service, including those relating to information, communication and technology services, in their broadest sense, through to others that apply to an entire range of schemes.  In education, for example, many reforms have been introduced regarding the examination system.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">The OECD will acknowledge that these reforms measure up to the best on offer elsewhere.  Ireland does not need to look to the example of any other country as regards how it operates its systems.  Compliance with Revenue stands at 94% and there are very few queries relating to the 1 million plus people on social welfare.  Our systems are as good as any that exist elsewhere and Singapore might be our only competitor as regards many of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">There are other areas in respect of which, for a number of reasons, reforms have not been introduced.  We have, therefore, asked the OECD to benchmark our levels of performance in certain areas, particularly in terms of the disconnect.  We have not been good at cross-departmental and cross-agency co-operation.  Traditionally, civil servants have been viewed as working for particular Departments and Ministers and, as a result, the co-operation to which I refer did not exist.  The main reason for the OECD's work is to discover how connections can be made and how people can work for the system rather than for individual Departments or agencies.  The record of other countries in this regard is better than ours.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">The OECD's review will concentrate, in particular, on the aspect to which I refer.  It is, however, not the only aspect involved.  People from the private sector are assisting the OECD in its work and individuals from the latter's head office in Paris have been engaged for most of the year in examining this matter.  We will consider the OECD's recommendations and we will, it is hoped, learn something from them.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">On the broader issue of our own charters, the Deputy is correct that what has shown up in surveys in new areas is that people would like to get information faster and want clear guidance.  This applies to the Garda Síochána and other areas.  In the customer charters, every Department, tying in civil servants across the system, is to work out what it is prepared to do as a service and benchmark itself against whether it can deliver this.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">In respect of the Civil Service and its trade unions and staff associations, we are at a stage where most of the reports from the Departments, if they are not finished, will be finished by the end of this month.  These reports will set out for the period from 2008 to 2010 the next challenges they are trying to deal with as Departments.  That is being overseen by Ministers and probably the management advisory committees in every Department.  It is the next level of how we can make our Departments more user and customer friendly.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">This issue comes up all the time.  When we are talking about reform of the public service, we tend to be marvellous at bringing it down to the telephone system.  Many of these systems have come from the great and the good of the private sector where everyone believes that if one follows the most efficient parts of the private sector, everything will work and all one has to do is press this button or that button.  The old Shanks' mare of the Civil Service was perhaps better.  I was here five years ago answering questions about why we could not use the great technology in some parts of the private sector which would allow  people to press buttons rather than having to explain themselves to various people.  Now that we have all the buttons, everyone wants to go back to the old system.  I agree that in life, one sometimes goes around the merry bush and then goes back to the way it was.  That is where that came from.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">We would still have the same result so it would not matter.  The technology sometimes works but it does not do so in other cases.  In most cases, the schemes in which the research groups are involved are good and they are doing precisely what Deputy Gilmore is requesting.  They are not trying to think up things themselves but rather to reflect on what the public is telling them.  Civil servants are genuinely trying to do that.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_15">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_55">Like the Taoiseach, I am not besotted with the latest gadgetry from the private sector.  In respect of customer charters and evaluations carried out in the public sector, has this not simply created another tier of paperwork?  If one calls a Garda station, one wants a garda to appear.  One does not want to be sent a copy of the customer charter, or if one contacts a Department, one wants to receive a service from it.  Has this method of reforming the public sector, which involves the use of charters, evaluations and so on, not simply created a new culture of box ticking where, instead of delivering the service directly to the member of the public who asks for it, one must make sure the procedures are all being followed and that the boxes are all ticked so that it complies with whatever charter or evaluation document must be complied with?</p>
            <p eId="para_56">I return to this simple idea that in a country of 4.25 million people, should it not be possible to have a service culture in the public service generally that holds that the job is to provide the service to the public as quickly and efficiently as possible.  I believe this culture exists in many areas of the public sector and among probably the great majority of public servants.  I am concerned that we are creating a parallel universe in the public service which is about complying with charters and evaluation documents and ticking boxes, and we are spending more time doing that than delivering the service to the public.  That is a complaint I hear repeatedly from public servants — even nurses in hospitals — who find the amount of time they spend on paperwork is taking away from the time to provide direct services to patients, for example.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_16">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_57">I will not disagree with that in the context of the wider public service.  For example, if gardaí catch an individual robbing a car, they must fill out ten forms to justify they caught the person robbing the car.  However, that is called justice and one has to go through these procedures.  If we keep going this way, we will have more gardaí who are better at handwriting than catching criminals.  This is the problem.  Procedures are in place and people check on gardaí as to how they caught someone and whether they got the right person.  That is part of modern life.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">The Deputy is correct that it is an annoyance to people in the health, education and justice services.  In the Civil Service, however, it is different.  When drawing up its customer charter initiative, the Revenue Commissioners asked members of the public, such as those involved in small businesses, what they wanted in, for example, turnaround times.  This was done in tangible terms, looking at what standards of service customers could expect to receive from a section or division.  With this in mind, over the past several years each Department and Government office has drawn up and is committed to a charter of service standards for customers that will be delivered.  These are measurable in order to establish a benchmark for future improvements in services.  It requires work in setting it up but it is not done by a group of civil servants in isolation but through consultation with the people they are serving.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">There are many benefits to these charters.  The process of drawing them up is based on consultation with customers and frontline staff.  It establishes clear performance standards which are committed to publicly.  It introduces a series of methods to measure standards performance and service delivery through, for example, surveys and the publications of results.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">Public service organisations must make these public statements and must be accountable in this way.  I accept they should not spend all day drawing up reports and plans when they must deliver services.  However, the idea is that if the charter is in place, they must deliver.  It puts pressure on the system to deliver.  This has worked well in my Department with regard to the speed at which queries from the public are replied to.  These replies contain an acknowledgement and detailed information.  The process has changed the way public service organisations think.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">All Departments and Government offices have published customer charters.  The extent to which service targets have been met are reported in their annual reports.  It is not just an excuse for paperwork but a commitment as to what they must do and the time it should take to provide a service.  Delivery of these commitments is then detailed in the annual report.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">The process is making the Civil Service more efficient.  The Deputy will recall how it was difficult to introduce new technology in the Civil Service.  Both the Civil Service and the public service now embrace new technology.  Is it enough?  No, it is not.  Is there room for improvement?  Sectors, such as the HSE, need far better technology.  We had rows about PPARS but some services need better technology.  There are too many different systems with different procedures.  Leaving aside delivery of services to the public, the management of systems can be too complicated and cumbersome.  There were too many systems in the health board and there still are.  It is a major task, on which I have been spending some time recently, to see whether we can put in place a system that makes sense in terms of better management performance and financial data.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_17">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_63">I agree with the Taoiseach that the Revenue Commissioners, in particular, have improved communications and now have texting facilities for customers, which is genuinely innovative.  Social welfare provision has also been reformed.  However, in recent times, partly as a consequence of decentralisation, as the Taoiseach knows, people are told they must submit their applications months in advance if they are coming to retirement and  as regards child benefit, lone parent allowances etc.  When we had limited technology the total turnaround time was less than 12 weeks and it is now much longer.  The point is that when something happens whereby the service visibly deteriorates, all the jargon about better regulation, better Government and so on is meaningless to someone who is coming up to pension age having paid his or her contributions and finding that it is far more difficult to get the State pension than he or she first thought.  Will the Taoiseach agree that what we are doing in the public service at the moment is growing middle management, people who write reports?  What is being done about this type of proliferation?</p>
            <p eId="para_64">Everybody in senior management in the public service gets a bonus.  How is a distinction made between some Departments which palpably do not produce the goods and those that do?  They all get bonuses and there is no distinction.  Even the head of the HSE received an €80,000 bonus.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanBarrett" eId="spk_18">
            <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_65">The Taoiseach rightly said that the customer deserves a service.  Will he agree that where the State imposes an obligation on the public, such as NCT testing, a service provided on behalf of the State as a result of legislation passed in this Parliament, the customer should be facilitated?  Is he aware that in some testing stations, at present, where previously car owners were sent a date and an appointment time for vehicles to be tested, now they have to phone up and be put on a waiting list?  This is a perfect example of somebody who must adhere to the law, but whose date might have expired before the company carrying out the service on behalf of the State had changed the rules.  Does the Taoiseach agree that it is important that this Parliament be answerable?  When a Deputy such as myself tables a parliamentary question as to why this has happened, the Minister responsible passes him or her on to the Road Safety Authority.  We should be able to talk about service in the Dáil.  I ask the Taoiseach to get the Minister to look into this matter and ensure questions are answered in the House reflecting the service, as he rightly says, that the customer deserves.</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_19">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_66">The point Deputy Burton makes is the very reason charters are important.  If there are delays in any of the areas she has mentioned, pensions in particular, targets should be set towards dealing with the issues, getting the paperwork in and  turning matters around as quickly as possible.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs, given the volume of work it handles, has a good record, but if there are certain areas that are slow, that is an issue for the charter.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">The same may be said as regards the point Deputy Barrett makes.  Where there are statutorily bound public services for which people must pay, then it is up to the Civil Service to facilitate matters.  I shall raise the particular issue he mentions as regards the NCT test.  It is a matter of getting shorter time spans so that real efficiencies and savings, where applicable, can be achieved in the time that public servants take to turn around the services the public needs.</p>

         if he is satisfied that the Garda Síochána is sufficiently resourced to tackle gangland crime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_20">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_69">Last week in a lengthy debate in this House on tackling crime I made the point that the Government has a duty to vindicate the rights of citizens to enjoy their lives and their property peaceably.  I repeat the assurance I gave to the House that this Government will never be found wanting in taking whatever measures can reasonably be taken to tackle crime.  I also said it is my intention to prioritise areas such as gun crime, organised crime and drugs and public order.  At the very forefront of those measures is providing the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána with the level of resources he needs to tackle crime in all its shapes and forms.</p>
            <p eId="para_70">The current programme for Government re-affirms the commitment to increase Garda strength to 15,000, with a target date of 2010, with a commitment to further increase Garda strength to 16,000 by 2012.  The current strength of the Garda Síochána is 13,288 with a further 1,358 recruits in training.</p>
            <p eId="para_71">Approval has also been given for the recruitment of 600 civilian staff, 300 of whom have already been assigned.  The civilianisation of non-policing functions is a priority development for the future of the force.  As set out clearly by the Garda Síochána inspectorate, international best practice focuses police officers on core policing functions.  Civilianisation will release many gardaí for the operational duties for which they are professionally trained.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">The Garda budget now stands at €1.44 billion.  This compares to just over €0.9 billion five years ago.  Garda overtime this year will total about €140 million.  This compares to €66 million five years ago.  The Garda fleet is undergoing major modernisation.  Last year €24.7 million was used to purchase 1,378 vehicles for the force, renewing over half the entire fleet.  The national development plan provides €260 million over the next five years for Garda stations and other accommodation.  This level of resources translates into tangible improvements with increased and improved levels of policing on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_73">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">Technology is and will continue to be an essential tool in supporting the gardaí in their day to day work and I am determined that the gardaí will have access to state of the art technology in carrying out their duties.  The Garda Síochána will deploy the latest technology to enhance its capability to effectively tackle gangland crime.  A new national digital radio system is being implemented over the next two years.  Over 17,000 radios will be provided for gardaí, in Garda vehicles and other locations.  The development of a new major incidents system will automate many of the functions currently being performed manually when a major incident occurs.  The roll-out of a new automated fingerprint identification system for the Garda technical bureau is virtually completed.  The procurement of a new automated ballistic identification system is underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">Last week the Garda Commissioner announced significant enhancements to the way in which the investigation of major crimes will be managed by the gardaí.  In addition to the appointment of 21 divisional detective inspectors and additional regional detective superintendents, a senior investigating officer will take charge of each serious crime investigation and each serious crime will also have a designated incident room co-ordinator.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">Combating gun crime, organised crime and drug trafficking requires a sustained and long-term effort.  There is no quick-fix solution.  However, this Government and I are committed to continue resourcing the force to face these challenges into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">As we awoke this morning to the news of yet another gangland murder in our community I put it to the Minister that not enough is being done to resource the Garda Síochána.  In saying that, I accept the Garda Síochána alone will not solve the crime crisis.  There is a need for a community response.  However, this community response must be led by a properly resourced and properly equipped Garda Síochána.  Does the Minister accept the need for modern resources is paramount?</p>
            <p eId="para_78">The gangland killings of the type to which we are now becoming accustomed on a daily basis will not be resolved or minimised until the Minister addresses the matter of resources as opposed to mere numbers.  I draw his attention to the recently published report of former chief inspector, Kathleen O'Toole, in which she states almost half the Garda stations do not have access to a car.  The Garda digital radio equipment promised by the Minister's predecessor <i>ad nauseam</i> has still not been delivered.  Will the Minister specify when the contract for the pay and go radio network will be signed?  It has been tested on numerous occasions.</p>

A new national digital radio system is being implemented over the next two years.  Over 17,000 radios will be provided for gardaí in Garda vehicles and other locations.  The development of a new major incidents system will automate many of the functions currently being performed manually when a major incident occurs.  The roll out of a new automated fingerprint identification system for the Garda technical bureau is virtually completed.  The procurement of a new automated ballistic identification system is underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">Last week the Garda Commissioner announced significant enhancements to the way in which the investigation of major crimes will be managed by the gardaí.  In addition to the appointment of 21 divisional detective inspectors and additional regional detective superintendents, a senior investigating officer will take charge of each serious crime investigation, and each serious crime will also have a designated incident room co-ordinator.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">Combating gun crime, organised crime and drug trafficking requires a sustained and long-term effort.  There is no quick-fix solution but the Government is committed to continuing to resource the force to face these challenges.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">Does the Minister agree that these gangsters are not living in fear of anybody and that there is now a subculture of vicious crime that needs to be addressed?  Does he agree that the standard stage-managed response of the Government over the past five years or more has been to say that, on foot of a meeting with the Garda Commissioner, the Minister has been assured the question of resources is not an issue?  This well-worn mantra is no longer valid in the context of Kathleen O'Toole's report.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">Will the Minister comment on improvements for the emergency response unit and his attitude towards arming further units of the Garda Síochána?  Will he consider favourably discussing with the Garda Commissioner the concept of introducing the Defence Forces as back-up, if necessary?  We are dealing with circumstances in which the Garda is so under-resourced that it is not equipped properly to deal with this issue.  We need a response of a kind that has not featured to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">I do not accept that the Garda is under-resourced — this is not at the heart of the difficulties we are facing — and I do not accept my discussions with the Garda Commissioner are stage managed.  As a matter of necessity, every Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must liaise constantly with the Commissioner.  As late as yesterday, the Commissioner assured me he has sufficient resources to deal with the intelligence aspects of the problem in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">Under the relevant legislation, it is not the function of the Chief Inspector of the Garda Inspectorate to advise the Minister on resources; there are plenty of people who give us opinions on resources.  It is the function of the inspector to ensure resources are being utilised efficiently and wisely, and the inspector's reports to date on this subject have been of a very high standard and repay study.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">On the possible deployment of the Defence Forces, the Defence Forces assist the civil power when required.  As the Deputy has raised the question, I will certainly raise it with the Commissioner.  Naturally, if the Garda Síochána were of the opinion that it needed the assistance of the Defence Forces to back up the civil power, it would request such assistance.  However, it should be borne in mind that the Defence Forces are not trained in policing functions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_88">It is important at the outset to distinguish between the respective roles and functions of property management companies and property management agents.  Property management agents undertake property-related services under contract for the property management companies which comprise the residents in multi-unit developments.  Since they provide property services, property management agents, together with auctioneers and estate agents, will be covered by the licensing system to be operated by the new regulatory authority that is to be established under the Property Services Regulatory Authority Bill.  The Government's legislative programme, published on 25 September, provides for publication of this legislation early in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">Pending enactment of the legislation, an implementation group has been established to assist and advise on practical matters relating to the new authority and to prepare for the new licensing system.  The current licensing system in the District Court will be transferred to the new authority.  A chief executive designate has been appointed and is engaged in preparatory work for the establishment of the new regulatory structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">Property management companies, on the other hand, are legal entities incorporated under company law and are subject to its provisions.  In December last, the Law Reform Commission of Ireland published a consultation paper on multi-unit developments which drew attention to a broad range of issues arising in respect of the governance and operation of such developments, including problems arising from the manner in which company law currently applies to property management companies.  The paper makes it clear that action to address these problems will be required across several policy fields, including company law, consumer protection law and the development of regulatory structures for the companies.  In recognition of the cross-cutting nature of the issues identified by the Law Reform Commission in its paper, a high level interdepartmental committee has been established to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems arising in this area.  A key task of the committee will be to identify the legislative and administrative actions that will be taken in response to the definitive recommendations for legislative reform which, following a lengthy consultation process, will be set out in the Law Reform Commission's forthcoming report on multi-unit developments.  I expect that the report will be published later this year.  I am anxious to make progress with the legislation that will establish an authority to regulate the auctioneers and agents and make some associated changes to regulate the multi-unit development companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">This issue was being raised in the House, on behalf of thousands of predominantly young people, for two years in advance of the recent general election.  Such people are experiencing problems with property companies and their agents which they could not have envisaged.  Many of them are contractually wedded to such companies, often without having known in advance that they would be.  These companies sometimes arbitrarily increase the fees they charge for services which are often illusory.  Is the Minister saying that the Government, notwithstanding the commitment given by the Taoiseach more than 18 months before the general election, is still examining legislative proposals that might afford some protection to the owners of apartments etc., who find themselves in these circumstances?  Is the Minister merely proposing to transfer the current licensing system to the new regulatory authority?  Is he saying that a broader change is still being examined by the high-level group and is likely to take a considerable amount of time?  While I appreciate the distinction the Minister is drawing between management property companies and their agents, I am not sure that young people with mortgages — who are up to their eyes in debt and are getting the run-around from such companies and their agents — will share his sympathy for that distinction.  When a young property owner contacts a developer, he or she is usually told to contact the local authority, which refers him or her to the management company, which then refers him or her to the management agent.  Young people are being sent back and forth from Billy to Jack without being given much relief from the conditions which oppress them.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_92">I can give the Deputy more assurance than he realises.  I drew attention to the distinction between the agents and the companies because separate legislation is required to deal with each of those categories.  In respect of agents, the legislation is not restricted simply to transferring the jurisdiction of the District Court to the new authority.  The forthcoming legislation will go far beyond that — it is intended that it will regulate not only auctioneers but also the agents which provide the services for the property management companies.  At the heart of the legislation that is being drafted is a desire to ensure that codes of practice, qualifications and proper standards are observed by agents.  The authority that will operate the legislation has been established on a shadow and provisional basis, pending the enactment of the legislation.  That is the position with regard to the agents.  I am sure Deputy Rabbitte, on foot of his examination of the working paper that was produced by the Law Reform Commission, is familiar with the complex questions which arose in respect of the companies.  The issues raised in the working paper are not simply matters of strict company law — they also concern consumer law and other branches of the law.  It is intended to deal with those issues comprehensively when the LRC's report has been received.  The interdepartmental committee was established to ensure that the issues being examined by the LRC, which will be reported on before the end of this year, can be dealt with in an expeditious way after the report has been published.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">When is it proposed that legislation will be enacted to give a statutory basis to the shadow authority which has been established?  Does the Minister accept that significant abuses are affecting thousands of young people?</p>
            <p eId="para_94">Some of these property management companies operate as intended for a defined set of services but many of them do not.  Many of them are front companies for the developer and they are up to every trick in the book.  They know the local authority will not take the estate into charge until it is completed.  They will retain a unit in the development so as to forestall other elements of company law that would normally give the residents the ability to direct the affairs of a management property company so that they would have some say in critical decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">I ask the Minister to be more precise in his answer to the House as to when these proposals are likely to come before the House.</p>

There has been a lack of regulation of the agents who provide the services and the traditional model of company law which applies to these companies is not appropriate to the companies that have been established on such a large scale in many new developments.</p>

         the steps he will take to deal with the high level of repeat offending within the criminal justice system; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [22612/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_30" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_100">I assure the Deputy that I attach the highest importance to addressing and reducing the rate of repeat offending and recidivism.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">My Department commissioned the first major study of prisoner re-offending from the UCD Institute of Criminology, the results of which were published in December 2006.  The study found that 27.4% of released prisoners were serving a new prison sentence within one year.  This rose to 39.2% after two years, 45.1% after three years, and 49.2% after four years.  Recidivism was highest among property offenders and lowest for sex offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">These findings are in line with international experience.  I understand they may be considered to fall in the mid to lower range of recidivism by international standards.  While these figures are high, they still show that just over half of prisoners do not re-offend within four years of release, which compares well by international standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">In order to reduce the rates of re-offending, it is vital that offenders, or those who come in contact with the law, are targeted at as early an age as possible.  Significant progress has been made in recent years in creating a more effective youth justice system, based on principles which are set out in the Children Act 2001, as amended.  The office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children has brought greater coherence to children's policy across Departments.  The Irish Youth Justice Service, an executive office within my Department which is co-located in the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, has responsibility for developing youth justice policy and operating the children detention schools.  The youth justice service is working to bring about a more effective youth justice system in which there is strong public confidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">All the provisions of the Children Act 2001 have now been commenced and the implementation of new community sanctions, which offer the courts a number of ways of dealing with offenders in a non-custodial setting, are being rolled out throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">The Government has allocated additional judges for the Children Court and it recently approved a juvenile justice and child protection package which provides 88 additional posts for the probation service.  The Garda Commissioner has agreed to appoint 28 additional juvenile liaison officers over the next four years.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">The new programme for Government contains commitments to double the number of Garda youth diversion projects to 168, to invest in the provision of appropriate detention facilities for youth offenders and to fund the implementation of a range of new community sanctions, including sanctions against the parents of offending youths which came into force last March as an alternative to detention.  I recently approved the establishment of an additional 12 new projects, bringing the current total to 93 projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">I wish to assure the House that the measures provided for under the programme for Government to deal with re-offenders, such as the expansion of the Drug Court programme, the introduction of a community payback scheme, investment in the rehabilitation of prisoners and the provision of Garda powers and resources, will be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">I have dealt in my reply with some of the issues which arise directly in the area of the prevention of re-offending to which the Deputy's question refers.  There is also a wide range of measures in place, many of which were discussed in the House last week, to tackle the issue of crime generally, be it committed by repeat offenders or others.</p>

            <p eId="para_112">I refer to the stark statistics quoted by the Minister.  Within four years of release, more than half of these offenders are back in jail.  These are not the violent criminal gangsters to which we referred earlier but people who are unemployed and petty criminals for the most part who are being failed by the system.  The reason the system fails them is because there is no rehabilitative programme in prisons.  The workshops are being closed, educational facilities are being withdrawn,<b> </b>the rate of literacy among prisoners is running at 65% to 70% and nobody is doing anything about it.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">I ask the Minister to announce to the House a plan or a policy his Government might have to deal with the question of habitual offending which is contributing to an unacceptable revolving door system within prisons.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">The last time there was a revolving door system, the Deputy's party was in Government.  That is a fact.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">A great deal is being done about these matters in the prisons.  It is not correct to state that the vast majority of our prisoners are petty criminals.  People are committed to prison for the commission of many different types of offence.  Our record of committing individuals to prison is in the middle range by international standards.  It is not as high per head of population as in the United Kingdom and is very low when compared with the United States.  People are incarcerated under our system after careful consideration by the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">With regard to what is being done, there is a wide range of services in place within the prison custodial system aimed at providing offenders with the means to avoid re-offending following their return to the community.  These include work skills training and education, which are matched to individual aptitudes and abilities.  A range of medical, psychological and other support services is available.  They include: individual and group counselling on offending issues; programmes in the areas of education, vocational training and life skills; drug treatments; specific programmes addressing the factors causing crime; one-to-one counselling and support; and facilitating the involvement of voluntary organisations in appropriate prisoner support services.  These programmes are delivered by a wide range of specialist services that operate in the prisons, such as psychologists, teachers, probation officers and prison officers.  Education is provided in partnership with a range of educational agencies, including the VECs, the public library services, colleges and the Arts Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">In 2005, over 50% of the prisoner population participated in educational activities and half of these did so for more than ten hours per week.  That is a high participation rate by international standards.  There is a particular focus on basic literacy and numeracy education.  A work and training programme operates in each prison.  As well as organising necessary services such as catering and laundry, it provides work and training opportunities for prisoners while ensuring a high quality of service delivery within the prison.  Work and training provide structured vocational training so people in custody can acquire the skills they might require to obtain employment after their release.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_123">I take it that Deputy Naughten's question refers to the processing of immigration and residence applications in so far as permission to remain in the State is concerned.  There is a broad mix of applications for permission to remain in the State that range from student conditions, work permit conditions, visitor conditions, dependant family members, marriage to an Irish national, EU treaty rights deriving from a spouse from another EU member state, and family reunification for family members of refugees to several other categories.  Furthermore, the international nature of immigration, has meant that there is now a wider and more complex range of issues associated with applications for permission to remain in the State, all of which require detailed and careful consideration.  Preserving the integrity of the State's immigration, security and social-economic systems, together with maximising customer responsiveness, are at the core of these considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">Immigration and residency applications are managed under a variety of administrative and statutory schemes, including several EU, UN and other international directives.  These schemes are significant both in terms of the process itself and the number of applications received.  Due to the high volume of applications received and the fact that each application has to be considered individually, it has been necessary to assign significant additional resources to the general immigration area in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">The number of immigrants coming to the country over the past decade and wanting to stay here is a reflection of the strength and buoyancy of the Irish economy, and an acknowledgement of the contribution that immigrants have made, and want to continue to make, to Irish society.  An indication of the scale of applications can be gathered from the fact that in 2004 a total of 2,235 applications were received from individuals seeking permission to remain or change their residence status.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">By 2006, this figure had increased to 8,925 applications which represents a 400% increase in only two years.  Likewise, applications under the EU directive on the free movement of persons increased from 355 applications in 2004 to 1,462 applications in 2006.  This represents a 411% increase in two years.  In addition, 17,920 applications for leave to remain under the Irish born child 2005 scheme were received of which 16,983 were granted.  The renewal scheme commenced in February and 11,167 applications had been received by the end of August of which 9,701 were given renewal of leave to remain.  Deputies will recall progression was a condition of this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">The level of work across the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service is kept under constant review and staff are redeployed regularly to meet these demands.  In doing this, it is important to state that the service has finite staff resources and a delicate balance must be struck between the various services which must be supported and the requirement to meet public and customer expectations, including Government priorities at any given time.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">In addition to dealing with the various types of immigration and residence applications, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service operates four helplines for applicants for visas, citizenship, residency status and related immigration matters.  These helplines have proved to be very worthwhile with large numbers of callers availing of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">The Immigration Residence and Protection Bill 2007, published in April 2007, is being reviewed with a view to re-publication shortly.  This Bill, when enacted, will streamline our immigration system to the benefit of applicant and practitioner alike.  It will provide for more rapid processing in certain areas.  The new legislation will pull together a wide body of immigration legislation and also for the first time will provide a legal status of long-term resident with rights equivalent to those of Irish citizens.  In addition, the legislation will place the visa process on a statutory footing for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service will implement new technology platforms, including new visa, fingerprinting and case management systems, replacing some 20 disparate systems.  These new systems will deliver better customer service and enable speedier decision-making in respect of applications across the service.  The introduction of such systems will provide an end-to-end view of a client in the immigration service and link into IT systems in other Departments.  The systems will further strengthen the capability of the State to deal with fraudulent claimants by providing enhanced identity verification capability.  Significant savings have been made to the Exchequer in recent years by such enhanced co-operation between the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">I have given a snap-shot of the level of business conducted in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in so far as immigration and residence applications are concerned.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that the statistics I referred to are significant and demonstrate the shifting pattern of inward migration dealt with by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  I am confident that all the necessary steps are being taken by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service to manage the significant level of business it receives across the entire range of services within its remit.  I am also satisfied that the resources available to the service are deployed to optimum benefit and that this is proactively kept under review having regard to work flows and service demands.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">The Minister did not address the certificate of naturalisation or citizenship in his response.  Will he explain the increase of 2,600 applications between 27 September and 4 October?  This is an increase of 520 citizenship applications per day during this period and brings the total to 17,000.  What is the reason for this and what steps will be taken to cater for the additional demand?  The waiting list to deal with these applications is approximately two and a half years.  I agree they must be dealt with in detail but surely it should not take this long.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">No clear rules or guidelines are set down by the Department for this application process or for other immigration, residency and visa applications.  As a result, many applications are returned or refused because of insufficient documentation.  This delay facilitates illegal immigration.  What specific steps will the Minister take to deal with it and when will we see immigration legislation?</p>

            <p eId="para_135">Deputy Naughten raised several matters and I will take them in turn.  I am delighted to deal with the question of citizenship which was not asked in his question.  The question dealt with residency and immigration which do not of themselves guarantee Irish citizenship.  Citizenship rests in my discretion as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is a privilege to be made a citizen of Ireland and a person accepted for citizenship must subscribe to a declaration of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">I am advised by the citizenship section of the Department that the number of applications for naturalisation yet to be processed to a conclusion is approximately 17,000 and we have had a large increase in these——</p>

            <p eId="para_138">The applications are processed in a manner which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure it is not undervalued and given only to persons who satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.  On average, the processing time is 30 months.  This is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in recent years.  Generally, such applications are dealt with in chronological order as this method is deemed fairest to all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">These applications eventually land on my desk and clear rules and guidelines exist, and I am anxious to establish and see to it that this is the case.

        <b>Deputy Alan Shatter</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the consideration given to date to the provision of a new industrial school near Lusk; if a report on what is proposed will be published in advance of a final decision being made; and the effect of the proposal on existing residential institutions for children. 
        [22835/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_60" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_159">I thank Deputy Shatter for tabling this question because it allows me to outline the correct position.  The Government is committed in the programme for Government to invest in the provision of appropriate detention facilities for young offenders.  I take the opportunity to clarify that the Government's plans to develop new children detention school facilities do not amount to the development of prisons, and it is misleading to label them as such as some newspapers have done in the past week.  The industrial school concept, referred to by the Deputy in his question, has been abolished since the commencement of the relevant sections of the Children Act 2001 earlier this year and the facilities which will be developed will follow the children detention schools model, precisely the model envisaged in the Children Act 2001, as amended.  Children detention schools are focused on the care, welfare and education of young offenders within a secure environment.  The objectives of these schools are the provision of education and training and the preparation of the young persons to make positive and productive contributions to their communities on their return to them.  They are very different to prison environments and they are not staffed by prison officers.  The reference to these establishments as prisons or, as the Deputy put it in his question, industrial schools is inaccurate, although I do not fault the Deputy for it because the report appeared in the newspapers.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">In October 2004, a youth justice task force was established to examine the entire youth justice system and make recommendations to improve structures and services.  A youth justice reform package was brought to the Government arising from this review.  Among the recommendations approved by the Government in December 2005 was the transfer of responsibility for children detention schools from the Department of Education and Science to my Department, to come under the auspices of the Irish Youth Justice Service.  The Government also agreed to extend the children detention school model from children aged under 16, to children aged up to 18 years, removing all children from the prison system.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">There are currently four children detention schools.  Three of these: Oberstown Boys School, Oberstown Girls School and Trinity House are located on a single site in Lusk, County Dublin.  The fourth, Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre, a former industrial school, is located in Finglas.  The transfer of these schools required legislative changes and the necessary amendments to the Children Act 2001 came into effect on 1 March 2007.  The existing buildings are in need of substantial investment and redevelopment and new detention school accommodation is needed to extend the system to include 16 and 17 year old children.  Young males aged between 16 and 17 are currently accommodated in St. Patrick's Institution.  This facility will continue to be used, only as an interim measure, until sufficient children detention school places are completed.  Planning for the additional accommodation is under way.  Sufficient space is available on land already owned by the State to accommodate any necessary developments.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_61">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_162">What is it planned to construct in Lusk?  Will a planning application be made?  Exactly what facilities will be provided?  What educational services will be provided?  What is the timeframe for putting this in place?  In the context of the Government decision that the new schools, or detention facilities as they are described, will provide for children up to the age of 18 years, why does it appear that a facility is planned to be put into Thornton Hall for children between the age of 16 and 17?  Would such a facility not be contrary to the views of the United Nations committee that reviewed our performance under the convention relating to the rights of the child?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_62" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_163">The Deputy has asked a number of questions and I will try to answer them in the time available to me.  An expert group was established to plan for the redevelopment of the existing school facilities and the development of new facilities for older children.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that some of the buildings at Oberstown require refurbishment, which is the first priority.  I understand that the planning process is under way for the refurbishment.  The group submitted a progress report in December 2006 and is due to submit its final report by the end of this year.  It is considering a range of options, one of which is to locate all the facilities on the existing Lusk site where three of the existing schools are located and another is to consider working on the two sites.  Sufficient space is available on lands already owned by the State to accommodate these developments.  For that reason I want to put on the record of the House that there are no plans to acquire additional lands in the Lusk area for any further developments, contrary to a recent media report.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">The Deputy also mentioned Thornton Hall.  The proposed development of a juvenile facility on the Thornton Hall site predated the Government decision to establish the Irish youth justice service and to extend the children detention school model to all children under the age of 18 years.  The provision of this facility at Thornton Hall will be a temporary measure only, allowing for the earliest possible closure of St. Patrick's Institution.  The development of new children detention school facilities to provide for 16 and 17 year old boys is already in the planning stages within the Irish youth justice service.  While these new facilities may not be completed as quickly as Thornton Hall, they will not be in any way delayed or postponed as a result of that development.  The Irish youth justice service is committed to delivering dedicated children detention school facilities for all children under the age of 18 entirely separate from any Prison Service locations as quickly as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_63">
            <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
            <p eId="para_165">Is the reality not that the part of this proposal most likely to be speedily implemented is the provision of a new facility within the Prison Service in essentially what will be an adult prison complex in Thornton Hall?  Does that not run directly counter to the decision in principle made by the Government in 2005?  As the Government is waiting for the committee to complete its deliberations and report, is it not the case that no final decisions have been made on the location of new facilities or the type of facilities to be constructed and that whoever leaked the information to the newspapers was premature?</p>

            <p eId="para_168">As part of the transfer from the Department of Education and Science to my Department, the necessary capital was secured to ensure that what is required by the under 18 group would be provided.  That was not in place before the Government decision in 2006.  Clearly detailed planning is required on the best utilisation of our sites and the appropriate facilities that may be required on them.  By the end of this year that report will be on the desk of the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, who was delegated responsibility for this area some days ago.  At that point final decisions can be taken on the roll-out of these capital investments.  The provision of possible accommodation in Thornton Hall is purely a precautionary measure and that accommodation can be used by adults in due course.</p>

A mother stumbled across information which implied that her 14 year old was being used at the centre of a paedophile ring.  This caused her to visit her local Garda station and hand over her young son's mobile telephone.  As I understand it, the initial investigation led to the suspension of a serving member of the Garda and a civil servant.  The Minister said the investigation has concluded and a file has been referred to the DPP.  I do not know if he can say when and if charges are likely to be preferred.</p>

            <p eId="para_175">As I understand the position, the investigation has not yet concluded and a file remains to be submitted to the law officers.  That is the factual position.  It is the responsibility of the Garda to investigate criminal complaints, to gather whatever evidence may be available and, where appropriate, to submit the file to the DPP, who then decides whether a person should be prosecuted on the basis of the quality of the evidence before him.

A "clean slate" is considered to mean a wiping away of a criminal record.  "Expunge" is similarly used to indicate the deletion of old convictions.  "Spent conviction", however, indicates that the law allows people to decline to disclose their old convictions.  This approach assumes that the conviction will remain on the record but it encourages the rehabilitation of ex-offenders by, for example, opening up certain employment opportunities that might not otherwise be available to them if the record had to be revealed.  This is the approach advocated by the Law Reform Commission, LRC.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">Currently, no general provision in Irish law allows for the deletion of criminal convictions from Garda records.  However, with the introduction of the Children Act 2001, provision was made for a limited "wiping of the slate" in respect of most offences committed by persons under 18, once certain conditions have been met.  The provision in the Children Act, which came into operation on 1 May 2002, limits, as far as possible, the effects of a judgment of guilt, where the relevant conditions have been met, by treating the person for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, found guilty of or dealt with for an offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">The second programme of the LRC for the period 2000 to 2007 proposes, as part of an examination of the law on privacy, to consider longevity of criminal records and expunging of convictions for certain offences from the records.  The Law Reform Commission's 2004 Consultation Paper on the Court Poor Box conducted a preliminary examination of the issue of spent convictions.  In July of this year, the commission published its report on spent convictions, which included a draft spent convictions Bill to implement its recommendations.  The commission proposes the following in the report: the type of offences to be excluded completely from any proposed legislation on spent convictions include (i) any offence triable by the Central Criminal Court; (ii) any offence under the Sexual Offenders Act 2001; and (iii) any offence where a sentence of imprisonment of at least six months, including suspended sentences, has been imposed by a court.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">In addition, it proposes that a person will qualify for "conviction free" status after seven years from the date of convictions where a custodial sentence of less than six months was imposed or after five years where a non-custodial sentence was imposed.  The LRC's proposal is, therefore, aimed at relatively minor offences and at offenders who do not re-offend during the following seven years.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">It further proposes that all convictions, including spent convictions, will be disclosed at a sentencing hearing and in some non-criminal cases, for example, vetting procedures involving access to children; and that the system would be automatic rather than application-based.  In other words, the person in question would benefit automatically once he or she met the conditions and in those cases the person would not be obliged to apply to avail of the right not to mention a previous conviction.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">The report also makes more detailed recommendations regarding the issue of vetting and disclosure of criminal history for certain purposes.  The commission recommends that the current Garda vetting system be put on a statutory footing.  The report also recommends that certain sensitive posts would require full disclosure of all convictions, including spent convictions.  These would include any post involving care of children or vulnerable adults; any health care post; judges, barristers, solicitors, court clerks, court registrars and employees of the Courts Service; civil servants; members of the Defence Forces, prison officers, members of the probation service and of An Garda Síochána; accountants; and director, controller or manager of a financial institution or of any financial service provider which is regulated by the financial regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">The report, its recommendations and proposals for legislation are being examined closely in my Department with a view to determining whether legislative proposals should be prepared on this issue.  My own initial view is that the report is seeking to find a fair balance in the approach to an issue that is taking on increasing importance.  I am sure the House would also seek to ensure such a balance when it considers the long-term implications of having a criminal record, albeit for a minor offence.  In considering this issue, we must be mindful not only of the need to provide the convicted person with an opportunity to make a fresh start, but also of the effects of crime, even relatively minor crime, on victims.  However, I will await the outcome of the current examination before commenting further on the topic.</p>

            <p eId="para_190">Does the Minister agree that a breach of the law in respect of a relatively minor matter ought not be a millstone around the neck of a person for the rest of his or her life, impacting on his or her employment and promotional possibilities?  The Minister stated the LRC report includes a draft Bill.  Is it his intention to bring it before the House at a reasonably early date?  I reiterate that these cases typically involve a young person who in his or her relative immaturity may have breached the law in respect of a minor matter but over a subsequent period of good conduct ought to have that expunged.  The Minister has adverted to the fact that quite clearly this does not apply in regard to more serious matters but, where it applies, can he indicate when he is likely to bring the legislation before the House?</p>

            <p eId="para_191">I agree with the Deputy that the matter requires attention.  In the case of young persons under the age of 18, the Oireachtas has provided a regime of protection but, in the case of adults, a system of protection requires to be put in place.  It is of particular importance because the Garda PULSE system has been in operation for a number of years and it provides more accurate criminal records of individuals than were available before its installation.  With the passage of time and the increasing number of names recorded on the system, it is important that this issue be addressed.  It has been under examination in my Department and I am anxious to ensure legislation is introduced.</p>

            <p eId="para_192">I take it from the Minister's comments that because of the operation of the PULSE system and the capacity of modern technology, it is all the more probable these days that a person would find himself or herself in a situation where, for example, an application for a job is the subject of an adverse report from his or her youth on a relatively minor matter.  It is all the more imperative for that reason that we deal with this matter.  Will the Minister indicate in the context of the legislative workload within the Department when the Bill might be introduced in the House, given the Law Reform Commission has attached a draft Bill to its report?</p>

There is an anomaly in the current system in so far that if a criminal conviction is struck out by the courts, the details remain on the Garda's records, with particular reference to data protection.  I am not sure of the extent to which this has been covered by the LRC but I ask the Minister to address the issue of data collected and recorded by the Garda remaining on the record.  When will that be addressed?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_196">In May 2006, my predecessor launched the Irish Prison Service drugs policy and strategy, entitled Keeping Drugs out of Prison.  The implementation of this policy and strategy has seen an intensification of efforts to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within prisons.  A key part of these efforts is the introduction of mandatory drug testing, which is provided for under the prison rules which became operational on 1 October 2007.  Other elements include enhancement of CCTV, utilisation of video scope camera cell search systems, and enhanced security generally.  In addition, new visiting arrangements are in place in almost all closed prisons whereby only persons who have been nominated by the prisoner and pre-approved by the governor are permitted to visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">Facilities for screened visits have been installed in all closed prisons.  In accordance with the Prison Service drugs policy and strategy, prisoners in respect of whom the governor is satisfied that there is no risk of contraband being passed may be facilitated with open visits.  Prisoners who are caught receiving drugs or who test positive for drugs will be facilitated with screened visits only.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">On enhanced security, I have recently announced a range of security measures aimed at keeping contraband out of prisons.  These measures include the establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Prison Service; the establishment of an operational support group dedicated to, and developing expertise in, searching and gathering intelligence; and the introduction of enhanced security screening and searching of all persons — prisoners, visitors and staff — entering prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">The drug detection dog service will involve approximately 30 staff and an appropriate number of dogs.  A pilot service has been in place since 23 May 2006 and is currently running in the midlands-Portlaoise area and also in Wheatfield and Cloverhill prisons, the Mountjoy complex and Cork and Limerick prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">The operational support group will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific problem areas.  It will also gather and collate intelligence information in prisons, carry out high profile escorts and assist the chief officer in charge of security in the continuing assessment and improvement of security.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">There are drug-free units in Wheatfield Prison, St. Patrick's Institution, Castlerea Prison and Mountjoy Prison.</p>

            <p eId="para_204">I know the Minister is interested in history. I refer him back to the last programme for Government, for which I presume he also takes responsibility.  It includes the statement:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_205">By the end of 2002 we will publish a plan to completely end all heroin use in Irish persons.  This will include the availability of treatment and rehabilitation for all who need them and the introduction of compulsory drug testing for prisoners where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">This was in the zero tolerance era.  The latest programme for Government promises to build on this and do it all over again.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">My question was prompted by information prominently displayed in the public domain to the effect that the Government has "capitulated" in its commitment to introduce drugs screening in prisons and is not proceeding as set out in the programme for Government.  The Minister has provided much useful information, but it is not pertinent to the question of whether it is true that the Government is no longer proceeding to maintain our prison institutions as drug free and taking the necessary steps to ensure this is the case.  Does the professional advice available to the Minister indicate that it might be dangerous to proceed as the Government intended in making our prisons drug free?</p>

            <p eId="para_208">The Deputy appears to be under a misapprehension.  I have received no such professional advice.  One of the first matters I brought to the Government as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was a comprehensive programme of measures to prevent the smuggling of drugs into prisons.  Under the pilot drug detection dogs scheme, searching has been concentrated on visitors, but limited proactive searching of areas within prisons has also taken place.  The evidence is that the teams have had a significant interception and deterrent effect, and the current contract has been extended to November of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_209">I am satisfied that the introduction of drug detection dogs has led to a significant reduction in the number of drugs being introduced into prisons.  It is my intention to establish a permanent drug detection dog unit within the Prison Service.  In addition, as previously stated, new prison visiting arrangements have been introduced and enhanced detection technology services are being applied.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">One of the major challenges facing this country is the ability to deal with the disconnect between Crime Ireland and the Ireland of the law abiding citizen.  Jessica Ward is four years of age today and, like any child, she would love above all to have her Dad present on her birthday.  That cannot be, however, because somebody shot him dead last weekend.  Unfortunately, Edward Ward is not the most recent victim of gangland crime.  Last night, Gary Grant was shot dead yards from his home.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">In Dublin last month, there was the gunning down in broad daylight of Garda Sherlock.  Brian Downes was murdered at the weekend.  Whenever one switches on the television or radio news these days, the first five or six items relate to gangland crime.  People are being shot — many of them shot dead — on the streets, shots are fired into houses and innocent people find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time.  We remember Donna Cleary's death and the expressed wisdom of the Government that she was an innocent person in the wrong place.  So too was young Anthony Campbell, shot dead because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  How many more Anthony Campbells, Edward Wards, Donna Clearys and Garda Sherlocks will there be?</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Ten years ago, 38 murders were recorded for the year.  These were murders rather than gangland hits.  Of those 38 murders, 34 were solved, giving a detection rate of 90%.  Ten years later, the detection rate for gun crime is 16%.  So far this year, 14 gangland killings have occurred and firearms offences have rocketed by 600%.  However, the detection rate for firearms offences has reduced from 75% in 1998 to 37% last year.  Conviction rates are also decreasing.  The question needs to be asked: "Who is in charge of our streets, Taoiseach?  Is it the Government or the gunmen?</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The Fine Gael Party will support Government measures to deal with gangland crime and crime in general.  Why would we not?  It is in all our interests to do so.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will tell the House, following his meetings with the Garda Síochána and other persons involved in this area, what increased action will be taken by Government?  We have been told the CAB will receive increased resources and facilities to enable it to do its job.  Please explain in simple English what this means?  How many officers and extra resources in terms of Garda vehicles, radio equipment and weapons for those who carry them and so on will be provided?  What does the Taoiseach mean when he says the CAB will be given extra resources?  What does this mean for the woman who spoke at the public meeting in Neilstown of her daughter having to pass through a team of drug pushers on the street corner on her way to school on Monday mornings?  Will these people be arrested?  Is this what the Taoiseach means when he says CAB officers will move down from the higher level operators?  Will the Taoiseach explain, in plain English, what will happen?</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I understand cocaine parties are now the rage at locations around the country.  These parties are attended not by those impoverished on the streets but by those very much removed from that scene.  Are we to see that issue tackled by the CAB as well?</p>

          <p eId="para_227">The killings in Dublin last Friday and in Limerick last night were appalling.  I agree with what Deputy Kenny said and wish to again highlight the threat we face from members of armed gangs who have no regard for human life and who, by extension, shoot people who have nothing to do with crime.  Several people were killed this year — we are aware of at least three — who had no association with crime.  All deaths of this kind are to be deplored and leave grieving families in their wake, as has been stated.  We are all aware of the anguish of the family of Edward Ward and their moving comments in recent days about his death.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The Government has no greater priority than doing what it can to bring to an end this cycle of killing which has gone on for some considerable time.  The Government is providing the agencies of the criminal justice system with the financial resources and legislative framework required to tackle this issue.  Effective police work, successful prosecutions and prison places for those convicted hold the key to bringing to justice those involved in gangland activities and, in particular, gun crime.  We should not under-estimate the difficulties faced by the Garda Síochána in bringing these killings to an end.  As Deputy Kenny stated, this issue was recently discussed by the Cabinet and in the House last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The Garda Síochána has launched countless operations in an effort to protect people's lives.  Unfortunately, while statistics such as 12,000 vehicles seized, 32,000 drug searches carried out and 60,000 checkpoints set up are impressive, the Garda Síochána receive absolutely no assistance from those people they seek to protect when seeking information in respect of the leaders or members of these gangs who wish to continue their criminal activities.  This is a problem.</p>

In terms of what this means, Deputy Kenny will be aware that during the lifetime of the previous Government an extra 4,000 gardaí were recruited to bring Garda strength to 16,000.   Garda strength is at 14,000 now.  The current budget is €1.44 billion compared to €0.9 billion five years ago.  Garda over-time this year amounted to €140 million compared to €66 million just a few years ago.  Last year, €24.7 million was expended on the purchase of almost 1,400 vehicles for the Force.  This is continuing.  The new digital radio system will be implemented during the next two years, a priority for the Garda Síochána.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">Other priorities for the Garda Síochana in terms of its ability to break up these gangs are; a major incident computer system which will automate many of the functions currently performed manually following a major incident, the introduction of an automated number plate recognition system, an automated finger-print identification system and an automated ballistic identification system.  These are the four systems which the Garda Síochána has highlighted it requires in the short term.  The resources are required to implement these four systems along with ongoing expenditure.  These are just some examples of ongoing investment to ensure the Garda Síochána has the up to date technology required to allow it deal, to the best of its ability, with gun and other forms of crime.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">I asked the Taoiseach "Who is in charge of the streets, the Government or the gunmen?"  What increase in terms of staff will the CAB receive?  I acknowledge the four systems identified are necessary and that this programme has been ongoing for many years.  However, the Taoiseach recently announced that the CAB would receive extra resources.  How many new officers will be recruited?  Will CAB officers arrest drug pushers at a lower level, admittedly, visible on street corners in this and other cities in the early morning and evening?  Will they target those who put them on the streets and provide help for their victims?</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Will Deputy Flanagan's call for the establishment of a real witness protection programme be considered?  The Taoiseach signed up in Lisbon last week to the trans-Border, trans-European measures in terms of drugs which I assume everybody in this House would support.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will not opt out on cross-Border terrorism and cross-country capacity to deal with crime, which is becoming ever-more sophisticated and globalised?  Has the Government made a decision on this?  I do not believe the Government should blindly follow Britain which wants to opt out, when it already has an in-built mechanism by having an emergency brake applied and the capacity of Council to resolve any difficulties for our legislative system by virtue of consensus within the Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Who is in control of our streets, the Government or the gunmen?  I have told the Taoiseach that the Fine Gael Party will support Government on this.  Let us now hear what he has to say about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">A large number of gardaí are involved in operation Anvil and the CAB.  We are determined that the CAB will go after drug dealers.  The change involves gardaí becoming operational at all levels rather than dealing only with bigger issues of criminality.  It is an operational issue for the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">On the question of the establishment of a witness protection scheme, Deputy Flanagan's question related to whether such a scheme if put on a statutory basis would make a difference.  This is not considered a crucial issue from a Garda Síochána point of view.  Obviously, if it were, we would not have a problem with it.  As recently as yesterday the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform discussed this issue with the Garda Commissioner who is of the view that no benefit would be gained by its being placed on a statutory footing.  The real issue is the willingness of witnesses to participate in the scheme.  It seems clear that putting it on a statutory footing would have no effect and this is a big issue for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Deputy Kenny spoke about cocaine parties.  This issue is being addressed by the Garda Síochána.   I agree with the Deputy on that matter.  We need not debate it.  One must set an example.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">If we want strong justice and home affairs arrangements we must ensure that our common law procedures are fully adhered to and that we have the power, within the Justice and Home Affairs Council, to deal with these issues.  We do not take the same view as the United Kingdom on those issues.  Our view is to participate fully in the debates on justice and home affairs.  There are times when qualified majority voting would not be the wisest decision for us.  We will draft a declaration that we believe is in Ireland's best interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Deputy Kenny expressed concern about border crimes.  We are totally committed to maintaining protection of our borders.  Some of the issues dealt with by the Justice and Home Affairs Council are not in line with our criminal justice system and it is not in our interest to be part of them.  We must keep an Irish perspective on these matters.  In many cases our position is closer to that of the United Kingdom, although not in all cases</p>

          <p eId="para_242">I join the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny in expressing my horror at the three gun murders which occurred since the House met last Thursday.  Mr. Eddie Ward, another man in the wrong place at the wrong time, joins a list of people, including Ms Donna Cleary and Mr. Anthony Campbell, who have been gunned down in cold blood.  There have been 14 gun murders this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">In 1997 prior to his election to Government, the Taoiseach told the country that he would make the fight against crime his priority.  He said the Fianna Fáil message to the drug barons and criminal gangs was simple.  He said he would not accept them, they would no longer be allowed to hold sway over our communities and they would not live in luxury with impunity because Fianna Fáil had a plan to arrest them, prosecute them and put them out of business.  Since the Taoiseach made that statement in 1997, there have been more than 140 gun murders in the country and only one in six of those murders has resulted in a conviction.  In five out of every six, the gunmen have not been arrested, prosecuted or put out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Taoiseach may talk about prison spaces, but the prison spaces are empty.  There are 27 cells awaiting those not convicted of the 27 gun murders last year.  There are 20 cells awaiting those not convicted of 20 of the 21 gun murders in 2005 and 18 prison spaces await those not convicted of 18 of the 20 gun murders in 2003.  Will the Taoiseach explain why five of every six gun murderers in the past ten years have got away with their crime?  Is it not because they got away with it that the problem is continuing and we see a continuing spate of increasingly vicious gun murder?  What will the Taoiseach do to deal with this problem that he has not done in the past ten years?  What does he now say to the Irish people when the vast majority of the gun murderers of the past ten years, who committed their crimes on his watch, have not been arrested, prosecuted or put out of business?</p>

          <p eId="para_246">I do not want to simplify the problem to the level of prison places.  Nevertheless, we have increased them by more than 1,300.  Even allowing for the population increase in the past ten years, the number of people in prison for serious crime, under the various new legislative measures, has substantially increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">In reply to Deputy Kenny's question I listed the resources allocated to CAB, Operation Anvil, the Garda capital programme and the various Garda programmes and schemes to tackle identification, ballistics, fingerprinting and car plate numbers.  These are all areas where the Garda needs resources to fight a more sophisticate level of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The key point of what the Garda Commissioner and other senior garda state is that the high detection rates of other areas of crime are not achieved in gun crimes because in many cases the associates of the victims of gun crimes offer the gardaí no co-operation in their attempt to pursue the perpetrator.  In many case, while any rational person would say it is in the interest of those associated with a victim to co-operate with the Garda, the gang culture does not allow it.  Even where the gardaí are close to a situation and feel they have a good view of what has happened, the associates of a victim often will not give information.  That prohibits the efforts of the Garda.  In a number of recent cases the gardaí, through good intelligence and police work, got very close to arrests, convictions and the breaking up of gangs, but co-operation was not given.  In some of these cases, even people who have been badly affected or beaten still do not co-operate with the Garda.  This is not something that happens in the broader society but only in certain gangs, which are known to the Garda.  It is a real deterrent to the Garda in carrying out their function.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_249">That is a message of defeat.  We know the problem in getting convictions arises because the associates of criminals do not co-operate.  Some do so out of choice and some because they are afraid.  We know there is a culture of intimidation and fear associated with these gangs, but that is not a new problem.  It was encountered in the United States and Italy when the authorities in those countries dealt with the Mafia.  The problem was dealt with by the introduction of an effective witness protection scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">There is no point in the Taoiseach describing the problem to us when he has presided over it for ten years.  We need a sense of what the solution is.  Will the Taoiseach put a witness protection scheme on a statutory basis and make it effective?  I accept that a witness protection scheme in a country like Ireland must be different from a scheme in a larger jurisdiction such as the United States.  Will the Taoiseach make membership of a criminal gang a crime so the Garda has a different  basis on which to pursue these gangs effectively?</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The Taoiseach said that he did not want to simplify the problem but he was happy to simplify it ten years ago when he talked about zero tolerance.  It is not a simple problem, I acknowledge that, but after ten years of presiding over 140 gun murders with only one out of every six cases ending with a conviction, in circumstances where in 58 cases the Garda know the perpetrators but could only convict 19 of them.  What are the solutions?  I will put forward some solutions, but what are the Taoiseach's solutions?  Will this situation be allowed to continue?  Will the Taoiseach simply say there is nothing we can do, as people are afraid to give evidence because they are being intimidated and so on?</p>

          <p eId="para_259">On the question of the witness protection scheme, the Minister met the  Garda Commissioner to discuss this yesterday.  The scheme is ten years in existence.  It is under the direct operational control and administration of the Garda Commissioner, in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system.  A review of that scheme was completed just short of two years ago.  Certain enhancements were made in its operation and they have been implemented.  For obvious reasons it is not the practice to comment on the details of the operation of the scheme and I will not do that, but as recently as yesterday, it was looked at again.  The real issue is the willingness of witnesses to participate and not the basis of the statutory scheme.  Quite frankly, the Garda Commissioner and senior management do not believe that changing the basis of the scheme would be of help.  Some Deputies may believe it would but I am stating the factual position.  Deputy Gilmore is correct that the Garda by and large know who is involved in these groups and gangs, but we live in a democracy where people have constitutional rights, for example to remain silent.  During the term of the last Government we brought in very severe and tough  measures that were within the limits we thought were reasonably safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The Garda has asked the Government to deliver the schemes I mentioned at the start and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is proceeding with the automated number plate recognition system, the automated fingerprint identification system, the automated ballistic identification system and moving administrative staff to areas where it frees up numbers.  These are practical measures which aid the Garda and they must be viewed in the knowledge that the Garda has the capacity to purchase 1,400 vehicles a year.  We are in a position to be able to give the Garda all the things for which it has asked.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the ordering of business for the remainder of this session.  We have started this session at a pedestrian pace and much of the legislation the Government is bringing before the House is on Second Stage.  In previous years, the same pattern was followed and we found ourselves, in the last couple of weeks, with a large amount of legislation being put before the House, sometimes at short notice, sometimes with a very short time for debate and usually with the aid of the guillotine.Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House which legislation on the Government's schedule he intends to have enacted by the end of this session?  Will he at this stage give an assurance to the House that the guillotine will not be used in the way it has in previous years?</p>

          <p eId="para_434">I can provide a list but, to be brief, there are a number of Bills listed on the Order Paper.  They include the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Charities Bill — which we are ordering today — the Control of Exports Bill, the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill, the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill, which is in the Seanad, the Fines Bill 2007, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill, the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, the Nuclear Test Ban Bill, the Passports Bill, the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill and the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  The latter relates to the rights of the child and may not be taken in this session.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Some 17 Bills are listed to be published, including a nursing home support scheme Bill, a criminal justice (forensic sampling and evidence) Bill, a criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and a criminal law (human trafficking) Bill, which the Cabinet approved today.  That Bill will be published shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Another Bill due to be published this session is the immigration, residence and protection Bill.  The heads of the prevention of corruption (amendment) Bill have been approved and it is ready for drafting.  It will be out before Christmas.  Obviously, the social welfare Bill must be taken and there is a Dublin transport authority Bill for this session.  In total, there are 17 Bills, although I cannot guarantee they will all be out in time for debate in this session.  On the basis of the definition of this session, which is up to the beginning of the next, we hope the vast majority will be published within the session.</p>

Mr. Colgan has made contact with me to inform me that he is not, and has never been, a director of Brecan property management company, nor has he any property interests in the Balbriggan area.  He is not connected to Brecan management company, its directors or shareholders.  He has also informed me that Mr. Ryan is not listed as a director of Brecan.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">My statement was made in good faith based on information provided by a concerned constituent and with a view to raising the genuine concerns my constituents have.  However, I apologise fully to the parties concerned and withdraw the relevant statement.</p>

          <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
          <p eId="para_475">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_476">That Dáil Éireann approves the dispatch of Major General Pat Nash to the position of Operations Commander for the proposed EU military operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic with up to four support staff pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, for service with the EU mission in support of MINURCAT, established on 25 September, 2007 under UN Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007) .</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I thank Members for agreeing to take this motion at very short notice.  In commending it to the House, I wish to briefly outline the background to the proposed EU operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, which has been authorised by the United Nations Security Council, and Ireland's response to the EU's request to nominate an Irish officer to the prestigious post of operation commander.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">On 25 September 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 (2007) establishing a multi-dimensional UN mission in Chad and Central African Republic that will help strengthen security in the region.  Resolution 1778 (2007) establishes the mission, to be known as MINURCAT, for a period of one year, with a mandate focusing on the security and protection of civilians, particularly refugees, internally displaced persons and civilians in danger, and on human rights and the rule of law in eastern Chad and the north east of the Central African Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">More than 170,000 displaced Chadians and 236,000 Sudanese refugees live in camps in eastern Chad.  These people have fled from Janjaweed attacks, widespread banditry and criminality and clashes between rebel and Government forces on both sides of the porous Chad-Sudan border.  As Deputies will be aware, there is a very serious situation in the Darfur region of Sudan, where a further UN-authorised mission operating under the authority of the African Union is currently deployed.  The widespread conflict and attacks by factions within Sudan has resulted in significant disruption and dislocation of the local population leading to a significant refugee problem in neighbouring countries, particularly Chad and the Central African Republic.  Allied to this, factions opposed to the current Chad Government have used Sudan as a base to launch attacks across the border into Chad causing further disruption to the local population and impeding the distribution of humanitarian aid.  Moreover, in August 2007, serious flooding in eastern Chad washed out several camps and seriously hampered aid agencies' assistance to tens of thousands of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Since May 2007, there has been some improvement in Chad-Sudan relations and, in what seems to be a related development, the intensity of clashes between Government and rebel forces has reduced.  Progress is also being made in the EU-facilitated inter-Chadian dialogue between the Government and the political opposition.  In August 2007, the two sides signed an accord that establishes a new electoral framework designed to facilitate the holding of a legislative election by the end of 2009.  The text also commits Chad's political parties to negotiation and dialogue with the armed opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">France has a close relationship with the Government of Chad and has long maintained a strategic military presence in that country.  France's influence was crucial to securing the agreement of Chad to an EU military deployment under UN authorisation.  Chad had previously refused to accept the military element of a UN mission, which was planned in February 2007, to address the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Since early September, the crisis in Chad has been given greater prominence by the visit of the UN Secretary General, who was there to build support for the proposed multi-dimensional UN mission.  Mary Robinson also led a well publicised visit to Chad's camps during the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The situation in the Central African Republic is at least as challenging.  Since 2005, an already fragile situation has been exacerbated by the spill-over of instability from Darfur and Chad, the activities of criminal gangs and an armed rebellion in the north west and north east.  There are more than 180,000 internally displaced in the north east of the Central African Republic and further significant displacement in the northwest.  The Central African Republic's armed forces and police are in need of urgent reform and strengthening to allow them to provide security and achieve improved human rights protection standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The authorities of Chad and the Central African Republic have welcomed a possible EU military presence in their respective countries.  In early October 2007, a peace deal was initialled in Libya between the Chadian Government and four of the country's rebel groups.  It is hoped that the parties will build on this agreement.  The signing of the accord presents an opportunity for greater stability in the region and, with the deployment of the UN mission, an improved environment for assisting and protecting refugees and supporting the distribution of humanitarian aid.  The EU mission to Chad will complement the planned UN-African Union hybrid mission being launched by the UN in Sudan-Darfur by limiting the spillover potential from the conflict in Sudan.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The multi-dimensional presence will consist of three components: UN mission, MINURCAT, composed of UN police, rule of law, human rights and other civilian officers; a special Chadian police-gendarmes unit — 850 strong — dedicated exclusively to maintaining law and order in refugee camps, sites with concentrations of internally displaced persons and key towns, and assisting in securing humanitarian activities in eastern Chad; and an EU military deployment under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">UN Security Council Resolution 1778 authorises the European Union, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, to deploy for a period of one year from the date that its initial operating capability is declared by the European Union in consultation with the Secretary General.  The EU forces will be deployed to eastern Chad and the north east of the Central African Republic.  The EU forces are authorised to support the United Nations and to take all necessary measures within its capabilities and its area of operation to fulfil the following functions: to contribute to protecting civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons; to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel by helping to improve security in the area of operations; and to contribute to protecting United Nations personnel, facilities, installations and equipment and to ensuring the security and freedom of movement of its staff and United Nations and associated personnel.  The UN element of the mission is targeted primarily at supporting the civil administrations in Chad and the Central African Republic to protect refugees and camps with the support of a UN police element and liaison officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The EU is planning to launch this operation as a matter of urgency.  The intention is to have an initial operational capability on the ground in December, with the operation fully functional by the end of January next at the latest.  The decision of the Council of the European Union to launch the mission is expected this week.  The decision, which is referred to as a joint action, will identify the operation headquarters, the operation commander and the estimate of the common costs of the operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Ireland has been asked to provide the operation commander for the EU element of MINURCAT.  The role of the commander is to manage the overall military operation and to provide the military interface among the military operation and MINURCAT, the EU and the UN.  The EU procedure requires that the name of the operation commander be included in the Council decision to launch the operation.  That decision is anticipated in the coming week.  On 2 October 2007, the Government approved the nomination of Major General Pat Nash to the post.  He, together with up to four support staff, will be based at the operation headquarters in Paris and, subject to Dáil approval and a decision by the Council of the European Union, will assume immediate leadership in the planning and launch of the operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The motion before the House is extremely limited in scope and relates solely to the dispatch of a member of the Permanent Defence Force as operation commander, together with a number of headquarters support staff.  The nature of any further contingent of the Defence Forces to participate in this mission is being worked out and contingency planning for a possible contribution to the mission is ongoing.  The proposed nature of such a contribution, and the basis of our current planning, is a contribution of approximately 300 to 350 personnel forming an APC mounted infantry battalion.  However, this is purely a planning framework and is subject to further consideration and analysis, including risk assessment, by the Defence Forces.  I assure the House that there is no commitment involved at this stage.  However, to advance the planning framework, I have authorised the Chief of Staff to undertake a reconnaissance mission, including visits to the region and to the designated headquarters for the operation in Paris.  The Defence Forces will also participate in the EU reconnaissance mission scheduled to depart for Chad later this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">In the event that the Defence Forces can make a meaningful contribution to the mission and if it meets all the other criteria, including the risk assessment, force protection test and environmental assessment, I would then intend to quickly bring forward detailed proposals to Government.  Assuming that the Government approves the deployment of a contingent, I will revert in due course to seek the further approval of Dáil Éireann for the dispatch of such a contingent in accordance with the requirements of the Defence Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The costs associated with the nomination of the operation commander relate to the salary of the nominee and his replacement in the Defence Forces.  These costs will be met from within existing resources.  However, the costs of the overall EU operation and the proposed Irish deployment as part of this operation will be very significant. Chad is land-locked, extremely isolated and has little in the way of infrastructure, roads, rail or airports.  As such, there will be a requirement to develop infrastructure to allow for deployment and resupply of missions.  It is expected that the deployment and sustainment of the operation will have to be mainly by air.  In addition, the provision of suitably equipped sites, airstrips, medical evacuation, etc., will all be costly due to the location and nature of the terrain.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">All EU member states, irrespective of participation, will contribute to the common costs of the operation unless they specifically opt out of doing so at Council.  Common costs are payable, in accordance with EU Council Decision of 17 June 2002, through the ATHENA mechanism, which is responsible at EU level for the collection of member states' contributions and disbursement of moneys received in respect of operational common costs.  Each troop-contributing nation also meets its own "nation borne costs", while direct operational costs for members contributing personnel are met on a "costs lie where they fall" basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">The estimate of the common costs of the operation remains under negotiation among the member states at the Council and an outcome is expected in the coming week.  Under the gross national income key, which is used to determine member states' contributions, Ireland will contribute at the rate of 1.23% of assessed common costs.  The full costs of our participation will become known over the coming weeks.  Regardless of whether Ireland participates directly in the proposed EU mission, we will be faced with a significant financial cost.  In the event that it is ultimately decided to participate with 300 to 350 troops in the mission, the combination of common costs and nation-borne costs may make this the most expensive mission ever undertaken by the Defence Forces.  Unlike UN operations, there is no reimbursement from the EU for costs incurred in participation in the operation.  However, the massive scale of suffering calls for a response.  Affluent western countries, such as Ireland, have a duty to step up to the plate. We must not be found wanting when it comes to paying our share of the cost of supporting the United Nations in providing for the safety of and security for the innocent victims of conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">This is a very important mission for the EU and for Ireland.  The post of EU operations commander is a very prestigious position.  It is a recognition of the standing of the Defence Forces in the field of peace support operations generally.  It also recognises the scale of our potential contribution to this particular operation.  Holding this position would also contribute to ensuring that the quality and security of the proposed Irish contingent is maximised.  It reaffirms Ireland's support for the UN and multilateralism in a meaningful and substantive way.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_495">As the Minister said, the motion before the House is extremely limited in scope and relates solely to the dispatch of a member of the Permanent Defence Force as operation commander, together with a number of headquarters support staff.  However, it gives us an opportunity to discuss the future mission that obviously will follow this appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">I congratulate Major General Pat Nash on his appointment.  It is a measure of the regard other European nations have for the abilities and training of the Irish Defence Forces that they requested an Irish operations commander.  His extensive service with the UN and his involvement in the EU monitoring mission in the western Balkans have undoubtedly prepared him well for this role and he should serve the EU as he has already done.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Since this is an upcoming issue, Irish involvement in the Chad peacekeeping mission is the right thing to do and certainly has the support of this side of the House.  Since the prospect of an easy resolution of the ongoing military conflict in Sudan is unlikely, the refugee crisis will continue to be a major problem.  In the face of long-running inaction by the international community, Ireland will be leading by participating in this important humanitarian mission, supplying possibly up to 350 troops of the EU force, which could amount to 4,000 in Chad and the Central African Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Through the appointment of an Irish operations commander and the upcoming authorisation of Defence Force participation in the Chad mission, this House affirms that Ireland takes its responsibility to the international community seriously and is prepared to play its part.  The brutality of the conditions in Darfur and the internally displaced people's camps is well documented.  More than 250,000 people have been killed and more than two million people have been displaced.  There are 238,000 refugees in camps in Chad alone.  Once the displaced have escaped the brutality of the civil war and militia attacks in their villages, they are subject to the threat of disease, starvation, unhygienic refugee camps, as well as continuing militia attacks, abuse, murder and rape within the camps for internally displaced peoples.  Aid workers find access to these camps difficult and dangerous due to the geographic and environmental conditions and attacks on aid workers.  This could be the next Rwanda and we must take every action possible to halt this tragedy of inhuman proportions before it escalates further.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The current African Union, AU, force deployed in the Sudan is entirely insufficient and UN action on the situation was finally accomplished, with excessive and regrettable delay, through Resolutions 1778 and 1779.  The acceptance of the need for this action by the Sudanese and Chinese governments was long overdue.  The delay caused by both governments' resistance has resulted in years of additional murder, famine and displacement.  Participation in the Chad operation is the best support we can give to the UN-AU hybrid mission in the Sudan.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">While our involvement is appropriate and necessary, there are a number of issues of serious concern that must be addressed before we send our troops to Chad.  I raised one of these issues in the Dáil last week.  In fact, I probably raised both issues.  The first issue is the lack of sufficient air support for Irish troops.  As I said last Thursday, Chad is approximately 15 km inland.  The Minister accepted here today that it is a very inaccessible country.  The only way one can get in and out is through airlifts.  The fact that we must depend on others to provide this service for us makes us vulnerable.  I know the Minister will say that in the case of Liberia, we were able to depend on others, such as the Dutch for a medical backup service.  However, that was on a coastline; this is different.  We are certainly vulnerable when it comes to resupply and taking injured people and those with other difficulties out.  For example, the French have a continuous resupply line open to them.  Apparently, they are bringing in fresh water on a continuous basis and will be in and out all the time.  Maybe, we can depend on them but this may not be the case at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Whereas we may not have the time to do it, I would certainly recommend that the Minister seriously consider what I proposed here last week.  I proposed that the Government look at the purchase of, for example, a Hercules transport aircraft which can take approximately 50 troops at one time, for future missions.  It would be an idea for this type of mission.  The Minister said that it would be expensive and that it would be lying idle when there was no mission.  That is not the case.  It could be used in rapid reaction operations and for humanitarian and other purposes.  Will the Minister clarify that the Department of Defence will charter an aircraft, for which one trip will cost approximately €300,000?  This cost would be not be incurred if we had our own aircraft-carrying capacity.  Will the Minister consider leasing aircraft, such as a Boeing 737 combi aircraft, which would only cost €150,000 a month?</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Unlike previous missions, which lasted six months, this mission's term will be four months.  Troops will be based in camp for this period, which will lead to many issues, particularly psychological stress.  It is important the troops have both a physical and mental health back-up service.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">As recently as 8 October, the UN Under-Secretary General for Peacekeeping Operations expressed concern as regards air cover in the Sudan.  If there was insufficient air cover in Sudan, I would be concerned that air cover in Chad would be transferred to Sudan to make up the shortfall, leaving troops in Chad more vulnerable.  The Under-Secretary General asked European countries to contribute 18 transport helicopters and six light tactical helicopters, stating civilian and commercial helicopters are no substitute for the required military equipment.  Ongoing attacks on peacekeeping forces and humanitarian aid workers in Darfur, combined with insufficient helicopter capabilities make it more likely the helicopters committed to Chad and the Central African Republic may be needed in Sudan.  These are the same concerns I raised on Question Time last week.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_504">I understand the element of urgency in the motion and the Fine Gael Party is happy to facilitate the Government in this regard.  In the past three years, I was coordinator for human rights for the EPP-ED group on the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs.  We passed seven different motions relating to the conflict in Darfur and western Sudan and its impact on the region.  The Darfur conflict has seen misery, murder, rape and some of the most appalling humanitarian conditions prevail.  The result has been the flow of people from Darfur to eastern Chad.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">I am proud the UN peacekeeping mission to Chad will be led by an Irish military officer.  Major General Pat Nash, who I have met on many occasions in Collins Barracks in Cork and other venues, will relish taking on this challenge.  He has much experience in the Balkans but this will be by far his largest challenge.  He will be responsible for providing the operations commander for up to 4,000 peacekeeping troops in Chad, a significant peacekeeping effort.  It is a positive appointment enhancing Ireland's reputation for peacekeeping.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Getting a mission ready for January leaves a short timescale for what will be a complicated challenge.  Major General Nash will liaise between the UN and the EU and produce reports on the build-up of the mission.  It would be helpful if these reports on support systems for troops were laid before the Dáil.  We do not want to send troops into a war zone without sufficient support in equipment or numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">This mission is a positive development for the EU, largely due to the efforts of France's new President, Mr. Sarkozy.  The EU must take a more proactive position in supporting UN efforts at peacekeeping.  Even though we must make sacrifices in budgets, costs which the Minister outlined, we can well afford it.  Any Member who has been to that part of Africa knows the conditions people live under are almost like those from another planet.  The relatively small sacrifice in moneys is negligible when related to our responsibilities as a wealthy country in a wealthy continent to provide leadership in protecting people and their human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">What is happening in Darfur is an international scandal.  Ireland is as responsible as other EU member states in allowing the massacre continue over three years of over 250,000 people, many of them women and children.  The establishment of this peacekeeping mission is a signal that something concrete will be done.  However, this mission is about protecting a refugee population.  We must ensure sufficient troop numbers and supports are put in place in Darfur, the real open sore of this conflict.  That can only happen through increased pressure and brave decision-making at EU level, which has not happened in the past five years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_509">Tá áthas orm thar cheann Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre ár lán-thacaíocht a thabhairt don rún an-tábhachtach seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Is onóir mhór í do na Fórsaí Cosanta agus don tír go mbeidh Ceannasaí Oibríochtaí Éireannach  le haghaidh oibríocht mhíleata beartaithe ag an AE i bPoblacht Shead agus i bPoblacht na hAfraice Lár agus líon nach mó ná ceithre bhaill fóirne ina theannta.  Léiríonn sé seo stádas na hÉireann san Aontas Eorpach i leith oibreachtaí den tsórt seo.  Tá gach dealramh ar an scéal go mbeidh saighdiúirí de chuid na hÉireann páirteach san oibríocht mhíleata seo agus cé go mbeidh deacrachtaí móra ag baint leis an oibríocht mhíleata, tá gach dóchas againn go n-éireoidh go maith leis an gCeannasaí Oibríochta, an Maor Ghinearál Pat Nash le saighdiúirí na tíre seo agus le gach dream eile a bheidh páirteach.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Os rud é go bhfuil Ceannasaí Oibríochta Éireannach ar an oibríocht mhíleata seo, tá súil ag na húdaráis go mbeidh níos mó tíortha den Aontas Eorpach toilteanach páirt a ghlacadh san oibríochta i Sead agus i bPoblacht na hAfraice Láir.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">It is a matter of pride for me on behalf of the Labour Party to fully support the motion to approve the despatch of Major General Pat Nash to take up the position of operations commander for the proposed EU military operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, with up to four support staff, for service with MINURCAT.  The MINURCAT mission was established by the UN Security Council with the unanimous adoption of Resolution 1778 (2007) for a period of one year.  The mission will be multi-dimensional to help strengthen security in the Chad-Central African Republic region.  The fact that the authorities of Chad and the Central African Republic have welcomed a possible EU military presence is positive and encouraging.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">There are 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad.  These have fled from the fighting in Darfur.  There are more than 170,000 internally displaced persons, IDPs, in Chad.  There is also the issue of civilians in danger in Chad.  There are water and firewood shortages, for instance, and a serious problem as regards lack of respect for and the rape of women.  The intention is to have the operation fully functional by the end of next January, with the initial operation capability on the ground in December.  That is an ambitious target, but I believe it can be met, bearing in mind the calibre of the person who has been nominated as operations commander.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">Major General Pat Nash will be based in Paris.  He is to immediately take up leadership of the operation.  As the Minister pointed out, his appointment is contingent on today's motion being passed as well as a further motion being sanctioned at European level.  He will be the link between the operation and MINURCAT and the EU and the UN.  While as yet no decision has been taken as regards the Irish Defence Forces' contingent participating in MINURCAT, I believe this is something that is likely to happen.  The decision will arise in the context of the reconnaissance mission report becoming available.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I compliment the Minister on his foresight in sending the Chief of Staff on a reconnaissance mission, departing this week, to get the earliest possible knowledge about what the operation will entail.  A Government decision will obviously be necessary in terms of the 350 likely to take part in this mission and a further motion of approval by the Dáil, by which stage we will have a great deal more detail of logistical and other considerations that will be part of the deployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">In Resolution 1778, the UN Security Council reiterates its concern that ongoing violence in Darfur, eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic might further negatively affect the region.  The Chad initiative will complement the planned UN-African Union hybrid mission.  The hybrid mission is being launched by the UN in Sudan Darfur.  It will limit the spillover potential from the conflict in Sudan.  On the security and protection of civilians, the multi-dimensional MINURCAT presence in liaison with the UN country team is to train, advise and facilitate support for the PTPH,  the policing concept of the Secretary General of the United Nations.  The PTPH will be dedicated exclusively to maintaining law and order in refugee camps, sites with concentrations of IDPs and key towns in neighbouring regions as well as securing humanitarian activities.  The Government of Chad is to be encouraged to set up the PTPH, with emphasis on the urgent need to provide logistical and financial support for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The MINURCAT mandate will include liaising with the national army, <i>gendarmerie</i> and police forces, the nomads, national guard, judicial authorities and prison officials in Chad and in the Central African Republic in regard to contributing to the creation of a more secure environment.  The mandate includes liaising with the UNHCR and the Government of Chad to support efforts to relocate refugee camps in close proximity to the border and to provide logistical assistance for the UNHCR.  The exchange of information on emerging threats to humanitarian activities with relevant governments, unions of states and other agencies will be part of the close liaison envisaged by the UN Security Council resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The UN resolution focuses on human rights and the rule of law, paying particular attention to sexual and gender-based violence, the strengthening of civil society and ending the use of children by armed groups.  Last week in the Dáil, the Minister assured us, in response to a question I had tabled relating to the report of the Ombudsman for Children, that there was still some doubt as to whether persons under 18 could become involved in hostilities.  In the Irish context, that would probably be restricted to the details in regard to the movement of cash and prisoners.  I was very pleased, however, that the Minister gave a categorical assurance that no person under 18 in the Irish Defence Forces would be so exposed.  In that context we have absolutely clean hands in terms of moving towards this terrible practice of having children involved with armed groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The Security Council resolution authorises the European Union operation in liaison with the Governments of Chad and the Central African Republic: in addition to contributing to protecting civilians in danger, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, the free movement of humanitarian personnel and to protect UN facilities, installations and equipment.  MINURCAT is to achieve an orderly disengagement at the end of the period of operation.  The initial period of operation is for one year.  Does the Minister envisage that it might be deemed appropriate to extend the mission as the end of the year approaches if the prospects for achieving the objective are positive?  Would he be favourable to such an extension, in the event?</p>
          <p eId="para_520">MINURCAT is to achieve that orderly disengagement.  The multi-dimensional mission addresses a most daunting task.  The UN military operation will provide major support services.  The fact that the deputy chief of staff of the Defence Forces has been nominated to the role of operations commander is indicative of the excellent contribution of Ireland and the Defence Forces to other UN missions over many years.  It is fair to say that it is widely recognised not least by the missions where people were well served by the Irish and the recipients of what was provided by the Irish forces.  These operations are complex, requiring sensitivity, professionalism, patience and a basic desire to make the world a better place for everybody.  This mission will enhance the standing and perception of Ireland and its Defence Forces internationally but, more importantly, it will significantly contribute in a lasting way to the security and protection of civilians, human rights and the rule of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">At least 200,000 people have died in Darfur while more than 2 million have been forced to leave their homes.  Indeed, there have been reports in recent weeks of such happenings.  Next year, the UN and the African Union will jointly deploy the world's largest peacekeeping force — a force of 26,000 — to Darfur.  Hopefully, this force will substantially reduce the overspill into the Republic of Chad by its contribution to bringing about peace in Darfur.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish Major General Nash, all other military personnel and other personnel who will be involved in this mission every success.  It is a most challenging undertaking not least because people's lives will be at risk and people risk very serious injury, but that is part of the military way.  However, I am sure every possible precaution will be taken to ensure the safety and well-being of our troops are observed at all times.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">When the Minister referred to Ireland as an affluent western country, I had to dwell on that point, but it is true.  This is the most expensive mission ever undertaken by Ireland.  The Minister is right that we are now in a position to make a real and substantial contribution in respect of this terrible human tragedy.  Effectively, we will deal with the overspill in the context of Chad and the Central African Republic.  However, as I said, there are now indictions of measures being undertaken which should bring about substantial change for the better in Darfur.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">My colleague and the Minister's constituency colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, told me earlier that she was part of a parliamentary delegation which went to Lebanon in recent times and that the commander there was Major General Pat Nash.  She spoke about how well this all-female delegation was received by Major General Nash.  She also told me that he happens to be a Limerick person.</p>

          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_527">I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Mulcahy.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">This motion seeks approval for the dispatch of Major General Pat Nash to the position of operations commander for the proposed EU military operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic, an issue in which I have an interest.  Like many people in Ireland, I have an interest in issues of conflict across the globe.  This probably stems from the time I worked in Nicaragua in solidarity with the Sandinistas in the 1980s.  They had overthrown the corrupt Somoza in 1979.  In that conflict, the US funded the opposition which, ultimately, overthrew the democratic government.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Since that conflict I always feel a huge sense of disappointment when I see foreign troops on another country's soil.  It rarely has long-term positive effects.  My gut instinct is that however bad things become in a divided country, it is best to let the different sides determine their own future.  However, to refuse to send peacekeepers to countries like Chad and the Central African Republic would be like passing by while an elderly person is mugged on the streets.  As the Minister said, we must step up to the plate.  This is a very wealthy country.  However, I say with a certain amount of reluctance that this is the right thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">This is a serious intervention which I do not believe anybody can dispute.  The appointment of Major General Pat Nash is a sign of how seriously we take this issue.  The situation in Chad is very serious.  It has a population of 10 million and, as previous speakers mentioned, there are 280,000 refugees and approximately 180,000 internally displaced people.  Life expectancy is approximately 43 years of age.  Dealing with this is a fairly bleak prospect for any country or force.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">We must also show that the international community and this force takes the opposition, particularly in Chad, seriously.  President Deby recently changed the constitution to suit himself and his supporters.  This led to inevitable violence.  Such violence is only to be expected when people make such changes to suit themselves.  It is no coincidence that the constitutional change coincided with the dramatic increase in revenue from the new found oil reserves.  With the arrival of oil and US investment, there would be a concern that our new found interest is oil-related.  We must really work hard to ensure this impression is not accurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">This force is composed of many nations, with France as the core nation.  However, given the colonial past, the French may not be perceived as honest brokers.  I am concerned that may cast a shadow over the entire force.  Rebels and the opposition may perceive the force as an aggressive unit as I believe French soldiers prevented the capture of the capital by the opposition.  French participation may contaminate the force and this must be borne in mind in any future negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Libya, a country seen as an international pariah for a long time, has been quite involved in progressing peace in this region and it is important to acknowledge that point.  Another concern we must have is the close proximity of Chad and the Central African Republic to Darfur.  Previous speakers mentioned it has 280,000 refugees and over 180,000 internally displaced people.  This makes the situation even more complicated.  I understand fighting has gone through a lull over the past number of months because of the ongoing negotiations and the rainy season which meant military operations were not easy to carry out.  The rainy season is over and it is likely there will be increasing pressure for further military action from both sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">This is not only a great honour for Major General Pat Nash but also for our armed forces which have served around the world with distinction.  Despite concerns over French domination of the force and worries over what could be perceived as western intervention, I have no doubt the contribution of an Irish operations commander will facilitate the smooth running of the one-year mission in a region with dire humanitarian security needs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMulcahyFF" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Deputy Michael Mulcahy</from>
          <p eId="para_535">I very much welcome this motion.  I echo the Minister's statement that the European Union's appointment of an Irishman as operations commander for possible deployment in Chad and the Central African Republic is a great compliment to the Irish Defence Forces and nation.  As the Minister stated, any decision to allow Irish participation in EU forces must be laid before the Dáil for a separate debate.  It is very important to have such a debate and tease out all the logistical, geographical and financial problems that arise.  I am very glad the Minister has committed to doing so today.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Chad is in central Africa and has a population of nine to ten million.  It is largely desert, certainly in the north, and does not have a lot of water.  It has been riven by internal strife and life expectancy is either 42 or 45 years, depending on whether one is male or female.  The country is commonly referred to as the "dead heart of Africa".  I can think of no place that presents more difficulties for an international force in terms of helping at refugee camps and other tasks.  There will be a great many difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The public should be given as much information as possible on the deployment of troops.  First, it should be informed that the choice of an Irish operations commander is an honour for our Defence Forces.  If, at a later stage, the Dáil decides to approve a force to support MINURCAT, there should be a fairly extensive publicity campaign to inform the public.  After all, the public's money and consent are required and it is the public's Defence Forces that would be sent on the mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, I had the honour of bestowing an award on the last regiment of troops to leave Lebanon.  There is great public pride in the Defence Forces and the Minister will share my view that the deployment of any Irish troops should be considered very carefully in terms of logistics, access, egress and the necessary safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The House should be aware that the region in question is a dangerous part of the world.  Only a week ago there was an attack on the provisional African Union camp at Haskanita and it is quite possible that other relief operations will come under attack.  The proposed hybrid mission, including the United Nations and African Union, should be in place at the same time as a full EU deployment of troops.  The fundamental problem, which manifests itself in addition to those in Chad and the Central African Republic, is the conflict in Sudan.  The longer the international community waits before taking action in Sudan, the longer there will be refugees crossing the borders into Chad and the Central African Republic.  It would not be a good idea in the longer term if the international community dealt only with the effects of the problem rather than the core issue, that is, instability in Sudan.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I took the trouble to read the curriculum vitae of Major General Patrick Nash.  He seems to be eminently qualified and I wish him every success.  I have absolutely no doubt that he will do the Irish Defence Forces proud in his operations.  I commend the Minister for putting this motion before the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanBarrett" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_541">I, too, congratulate Major General Patrick Nash on his appointment to the position of operations commander for the proposed EU operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic.  Much has been said about the great honour his appointment represents to Ireland and the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I have had the pleasure of dealing with the Defence Forces and noted that they are at no time unwilling to participate in peacekeeping missions, regardless of the part of the world they are asked to go.  No country in the European Union has the vast peacekeeping experience of the Irish troops and therefore we should be very proud of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">There is a very thin line between peacekeeping and peace enforcement.  If we are to ask troops to participate in what is effectively a peace enforcement mission, it is vital that they be equipped properly and have a clear mandate at the outset.  Ultimately, we owe it to the troops despatched on overseas missions, and their families, to ensure their safety abroad and their safe return.  I have no doubt that, in keeping with what has happened heretofore, this will happen but it is nevertheless important to state the need to ensure that it be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I am particularly pleased to see that the European Union, as a body, is meeting its responsibility in this mission.  I note with concern, however, that it may be the case that some EU states will have the option to opt out of meeting its cost.  I object totally to this.  If we do not operate as a united European Union when engaging in peacekeeping and peace enforcement and leave it to some nations to pick and choose, the Union will lose credibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I have always held the view that the Union, as a unit, should play its part in the United Nations.  I still believe the Union should have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and that it should fund the United Nations in a proper fashion.  Like some other major powers throughout the world, the United Nations has been strapped for money over the years.  While it would be far better if the African Continent were supported in its efforts to deal with problems within its own boundaries, we learned a lesson in this regard in respect of Somalia.  When everybody else stood back, the United States moved in and a total disaster ensued.  It is a very difficult exercise to participate in a peacekeeping mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">During my term as Minister for Defence, I had the pleasure of meeting the then military attaché for the United States, who openly suggested to me it would be of great benefit if we allowed senior officers of the US defence forces to attend our peacekeeping school in the Curragh.  He admitted openly that they knew nothing about real peacekeeping.  What they knew about, and possessed, was the most modern weaponry in the world, and they were trained to use it.  I, the Minister and Deputy Billy Timmins, a former member of the Defence Forces whom I had the pleasure of meeting on a couple of occasions when he was on duty with the United Nations in Lebanon and Cyprus——</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_548">——know at first hand that the role of peacekeeper is a very difficult one.  It is not about going in with all guns blazing, it is a question of making contact and gaining the confidence of the people who need to be supported.  The Irish are the best in the world in this regard because we have this unique skill.  I hope that skill will be used when our troops go to Chad and the Central African Republic.  It is important that an Irish person has been chosen to work as operations commander.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">I believe ultimately in the proper funding of the United Nations.  The European Union should act as a unit in supporting these missions, not only by providing troops but also by putting its hand in its pocket.  I do not see why any EU member state should be able to opt out of helping to meet the cost of this mission.  As the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, mentioned in his speech, no member state is unable to contribute in accordance with its wealth.  The right way for the EU to organise these missions is for every member state to pay its share in line with its individual wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">It has been pointed out that this mission is being organised as a consequence of what is happening in Sudan.  As previous speakers said, the sooner we tackle that problem, the better.  Those of us who are not from Africa are not fully <i>au fait</i> with the manner in which the boundaries of various countries on that continent, such as Somalia, were formed in the first place.  There are many questions to be asked in that regard.  Do we know about the culture involved, for example?  To what extent are we familiar with the methods of governance used in these countries?  I refer to the tribal system, for example.  It is dangerous to send outsiders to Africa if they do not know what is happening on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">I am glad that we seem to have learned our lesson.  The EU was cowardly — we stood back and allowed a slaughter to take place — when the difficulties in the former Yugoslavia escalated.  If we can play a real peacekeeping role as part of the efforts being made to solve the problems in Chad and the Central African Republic, we will be playing our proper role in world politics.  We have learned from the terrible happenings in Rwanda.  I do not think we can hold our heads with great authority in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">This motion seeks the permission of the Dáil for the dispatch of Major General Pat Nash as operations commander of a proposed EU mission.  I understand and appreciate that the Minister will bring a further motion before the House when a decision needs to be made on the strength of the force that Ireland will send in support of the mission.  The mission should be a real EU operation.  It should not be confined to half, or a quarter, of the EU.  While some member states may not be in a position to supply troops to the mission, each member state should contribute to its cost.  I am not considering this aspect of the matter purely from a financial perspective.  I hope the point will be strongly made at a meeting of the Council of Ministers that each member state should recognise this mission by making a commitment to it.  This may be a matter for the foreign Ministers of the EU member states, but I do not doubt that the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, will have an opportunity to speak to his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, at some point.  If he agrees with me, he will make this point to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  The most important thing is the message that is sent out.  If we can afford to fund the entire operation, that is not the point.  The EU, as a whole, should show that it is committed to playing its part in this important mission.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">I want to be serious.  Like Deputy Timmins, I spent a great deal of time at meetings of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  I will make the point on Thursday that the joint committee should spend more time discussing defence issues.  The justice portfolio has dominated the committee over the past five years, which is fair enough when one considers that many serious matters, including issues which were raised in the Dáil today, have arisen.  Defence is as important as some of those issues, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Like my colleagues, I welcome the appointment of Major General Pat Nash, who is clearly the right man for the job.  I note that he lists hurling, rugby and golf as some of his interests — I am not sure he will have many opportunities to pursue them in Africa.  I wish him well.  It is important that the Dáil has this opportunity to record its appreciation of the work of the Army.  I refer in particular to the work of Major General Pat Nash, who follows a great tradition of Army staff who have served overseas over the years.  I am old enough to remember being given time off school to attend the sad funeral services in Dublin of Army personnel who had been killed on the African continent in 1960 and 1962.  Many people have spoken over the years about the great work that has been done by the predecessors of Major General Pat Nash, such as General Seán MacEoin, who served in the Congo in the 1960s, and General Jim Quinn, whom I visited in Cyprus.  I was never in the Army, funnily enough.</p>

It is good that the Army, which has such a tremendous reputation, is being given an opportunity to undertake such important roles.  This is not a political point.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Having listened to the previous speakers, I was interested in Deputy Barrett's comments and particularly impressed by Deputy Chris Andrews's knowledge of this issue.  I am sure I am not supposed to mention the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in a speech but, like me, he is a member of the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa.  He does great work as the vice-president of that organisation.  Deputy Barrett's contribution reminded us that there are difficulties on the continent of Africa.  I have not had many opportunities to go to Africa, although the previous Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid was always happy to offer to send me abroad if I wanted to go anywhere, but I was too busy.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">In the past 12 years I have visited a number of African countries.  I travelled to Zambia in a private capacity in 1995 and I served on an election mission along with former Senator Fergal Browne, who I am sorry to say is no longer a Member of the Oireachtas.  He and I went to Ethiopia and I have also been to a couple of other African countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Even though this is a motion to do with defence matters, we should remember the difficulties being experienced in African countries.  Ireland is now a significant player in both European and world politics and it has an opportunity to contribute to solving these difficulties.  I hope Ireland will continue to play such a role.  I am confident that under the stewardship of the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, this will be the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">Indeed, and he is a good man.  I am a big supporter of Deputy Cregan.  I know a lot about his constituency in<b/>Limerick and I wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">To stay on the motion, on 25 September the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 establishing the UN mission in Chad and the Central African Republic.  This will help strengthen security in that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I refer to the detailed and informed contribution by Deputy Chris Andrews.  Since 2004, eastern Chad has hosted some 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 different camps who have fled the fighting in Darfur.  Chad is also facing a surge in the number of refugees.  The authorities in Chad and in the Central African Republic have welcomed the possible EU military presence in their respective countries and this should be welcomed by Members of the Irish Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">The Chad mission will complement the planned UN-African Union hybrid mission being launched by the UN in Sudan-Darfur by limiting the potential for spill-over from the conflict in Sudan.  I am pleased to note the EU is intent on launching this operation as a matter of urgency.  The intention is to have an initial operational capability on the ground in December with the operation fully functional by the end of January 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Major General Pat Nash follows a tradition of Irish military personnel who have served abroad.  I have had occasion as a private citizen to observe how such personnel operate abroad.  The UN resolution highlights the contribution made by the military personnel to community life in these countries.  I noted this even in my limited experience of the few places in Africa which I have visited.  Some Members have visited more countries than I have and are aware of missionaries and Army people who become involved in different community groups.  I was forcibly struck by this involvement.  It is important to note the Security Council has made the point in its resolution of, so to speak, looking after the local population.  I know the Irish Army personnel will, both initially and when the bulk of the force arrives, become involved and I support this involvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">On one occasion when I was fortunate enough to submit a Dáil question — backbenchers do not have that many chances — I made the following point to the Minister.  Many former Army people — Deputy Timmins may be one of those — have a lot of knowledge to impart.  I am aware that Army people may not like such suggestions but the Army should find a means of allowing such people to make a contribution.  They have experience of the different missions in which the Army has been involved over the past 30 or 40 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I appreciate the opportunity to make a brief contribution and I wish Major General Pat Nash every success.  I also wish the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, continued success in his brief and in the great work he is doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">I take the point made by Deputy O'Connor about former Army personnel using their experience.  It is a little ironic that the Government press secretary, Mr. Eoghan Ó Neachtain, is a former Army man.  He will have to put all his skills to use to protect the Government.  He may have been under fire and in difficulties in the past but they are nothing compared to what is ahead of him in the next few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I have followed Deputy O'Connor in speaking order on a number of occasions recently.  He is a man for all seasons.  He reminds me of a guy called Lucky Louis who ran a souvenir shop outside the church of the nativity in Bethlehem.  He had something for every occasion.  Deputy O'Connor is very adaptable and I wish to compliment him——</p>

          <p eId="para_588">——on his speech although I am at pains to find a connection between Tallaght and Chad.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">I find the quietness in the Chamber this evening ironic.  I remember the debate on the Defence (Amendment) Bill which copperfastens Irish involvement in a mission such as this.  I remember wailing from the benches behind me from the Green Party Members.  The Minister will recall it well.  I do not know if we are talking about the silence of the lambs but I look forward to the contributions of the Green Party and of Sinn Féin in this debate because several months later I am still at pains to understand how they voted against the Defence (Amendment) Bill.  They may offer the House an explanation tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I welcome Ireland's participation in the UN mission but the security of our forces must be ensured.  The resources necessary for the troops must be provided.  Both Chad and the Central African Republic have very limited infrastructure.  Regardless of the cost, it is imperative that some infrastructure should be put in place before the deployment of our troops.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I am concerned that the African Union troops operating in Darfur are like lambs to the slaughter.  I join in the condemnation of the atrocities involving the African Union troops in Haskanita the weekend before last when 12 members of the force lost their lives when they were overrun by rebels who were not the Janjaweed but who were in conflict with the government forces.  Just because we are not involved in Sudan is no excuse to turn a blind eye to what is happening there.  The commanding officer of the African Union force has stated that the force is under-resourced and is unable to deal with the difficulties.  The last thing that must happen is for an EU mission to find itself in the same boat in Chad, which is a very isolated place.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Deputy Barrett referred to our success in Somalia and other speakers referred to the Congo.  We have encountered difficulties on the Continent of Africa in the past and the situation is very volatile.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">It is easy for politicians or well-intentioned people to call for EU, Irish or international involvement in Darfur in the Sudan but it is difficult to take such steps when a country does not wish UN involvement.  It is very difficult to ascertain who is on what side in the conflict.  The scenario is complex.  It is easy to call for involvement but it is men and women, sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, who must go out and put their lives on the line in a strange territory and a strange country.  It is often difficult for them to see the beneficial aspects accruing from their involvement.  There is an onus on this House to ensure that such troops, be they from Ireland or from Nepal or wherever, are not isolated.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I congratulate Major General Nash on his appointment to this position.  Anybody who has played hurling for Ahane will not be too soft centred so he will undoubtedly be well able to manage.  I have known him for some years and he is highly respected.  He follows in the footsteps of many other Irish military personnel who have taken over various UN missions.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">When I was in Cyprus, Deputy Barrett held the current Minister's portfolio.  He was highly respected by the Defence Forces, of which I was a member.  He visited us in Cyprus but there was trouble in Israel at the time so he was unable to visit Lebanon.  He stayed a few extra days in Cyprus, which was very welcome as it meant a change in duties for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">There was much political pressure on Ireland and the EU to participate in this force.  I assume the French President, Mr. Sarkozy, put a certain amount of pressure on the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Minister for Defence makes the decision to send troops overseas.  It is a dangerous and difficult decision; it is not as simple as flicking a switch.  I commend the Minister for making this decision.  If things go wrong, and they often do, people tend to start a blame game.  However, all we can do is put in place the required resources for the personnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">If a difficulty arises over there or we become concerned about something, we should say it.  It is important to do that and not remain somewhere or do something purely for political appeasement purposes.  Several speakers have mentioned the situation in Chad.  That area of central Africa is extremely poor; there is poverty beyond our realisation.  The situation in Sudan will have a major influence on how our force operates.  The role of the EU force is mainly patrolling and security, although I note the Minister's comment that it has not been conclusively defined.  However, I assume it will basically involve monitoring and keeping peace in the refugee camps on the Sudanese border which hold displaced people and refugees from Sudan, who number approximately 400,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">In the recent past Chad refused to accept a military element in a UN mission but the French have great influence in Chad where the languages spoken are French and Arabic and, following French intervention, Chad agreed to accept it.  We should try to build up a relationship with the Government in Chad.  I do not know what, if any, relationship we currently have with it but that is a role for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Operationally, General Nash will know how to carry out the mission.  The link between the local Chadian police force, which numbers approximately 850 personnel, and the UN police force is most important.  The success of the mission will depend on how the two forces get on with each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">In the letters to the editor columns of the various newspapers, one regularly sees letters from people calling for assistance.  They should keep in mind how difficult it is for the individuals who go to these areas.  Many Irish people have lost their lives on UN missions.  I pay tribute to them and their families.  I wish Major General Nash well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_600">I congratulate Major General Nash on his appointment.  It is a great personal honour for him and for the Defence Forces that a member of the Irish military is chosen to lead such a mission.  It is also a tribute to the training and the involvement of the Defence Forces in UN missions over a number of years.  Undoubtedly, Major General Nash and the personnel who accompany him will discharge their duties with the usual distinction and will do the country proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">An occasion such as this should not pass without comment on the reasons for the deployment, which have been evident for a long time.  There have been appalling atrocities in that part of Africa over the past ten years or so, each one bad enough to drive the previous one into oblivion.  The problem continues.  International commentators say such events should not happen.  The great thing about modern communications is that we have the opportunity to watch these events almost at first hand on the television.  The presentation of the deprivation, starvation, hardship and the ferocity of the wars that are waged on many fronts is graphic.  It is also possible to recognise the intricacies of such situations.  It is not simple to resolve the multifaceted problems.  We have seen the evidence of that over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Nevertheless, there is still a responsibility on us to be prepared at European and UN level to tackle such situations and to offer assistance and peacekeeping of a persuasive nature.  That is what is required in that region.  It is not as simple an operation as was given to other task forces in the past.  This will be a particularly sensitive and difficult operation but our Defence Forces recognise that.  They have been in such situations previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The recent experience of the various army personnel from Africa who were deployed to that area and who have suffered casualties underlines the necessity of ensuring that troops are deployed in sufficient numbers to be able to fend for themselves and to be self-sufficient on the ground.  They must be able to bring whatever equipment is necessary.  That means personal body armour, military hardware, gas masks and other equipment of the highest quality.  It must be modern and available to everybody and it must work.  The conditions under which the troops operate can be difficult and trying, and there are no second chances.  If something goes wrong, it reflects on all of us.  However, that will not happen.  It should not happen because we have experience in these matters now.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The UN has awoken to the fact that these problems exist and are ongoing and that action must be taken.  However, the slow speed with which the UN responds is most worrying.  Every hour of every day some atrocity takes place.  People are starved, shot, bombed or massacred.  Every moment of delaying the deployments that are required in these sensitive areas, which have gained such public attention over recent years, is time wasted.  The UN needs to think more seriously of using missions such as this.  The mission is helpful and welcome but it would have been better if it had happened some time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The same applies to our colleagues in the European Union.  It is no good protesting about the atrocities if nothing is done about them.  The EU is a powerful entity but it does not always exert itself in a positive way.  It has proposals for rapid response forces, battle groups and so forth, but these things need to happen.  Talking about them forever does nothing.  They must be put in place soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">I have said many times previously that we should consider increasing the strength of our Defence Forces at all levels, having particular regard to current and future deployments.  It is possible that more calls will be made on our Defence Forces to take up postings abroad.  It comes naturally from our previous experiences and given that the number of locations requiring peacekeeping forces is likely to increase.  The Government is aware of this and we would be negligent if we did not respond adequately.  However, if we respond adequately our Defence Forces will be stretched and this should not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">In any democracy where defence forces support the police the common denominator should always apply that the numbers must be kept at a certain strength commensurate with the population.  Our population has been increasing for some time.  Will the Minister respond to this point?  From the replies to the many parliamentary questions I tabled on this matter I believe these thoughts run through the minds of Department officials and the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Wherever our troops are deployed, whether on UN missions or otherwise, they should be familiar with their colleagues and it is of critical importance that they undergo adequate training whether at UN or EU level.  Sufficient integration of training should occur and over such time as to ensure our troops are fully <i>au fait</i> with their colleagues and that their colleagues are fully <i>au fait</i> with their ability to work in the situation.  I do not doubt this can, will and does happen.  I did not get to Tallaght, Limerick or other places to which I wanted to travel during my speech, but I have no doubt I will in the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_609">I thank Deputy Timmins for reminding people of our stance against EU battle groups.  I made it consistently clear that we opposed Government moves to undermine and diminish the neutrality of the State.  While we are happy this mission has the agreement of the United Nations, which in our view is a prerequisite for any Irish involvement in peacekeeping missions, it is not a UN peacekeeping force.  It is the first of many EU battle group adventures abroad.  With everybody else in the House we are worried about the deteriorating circumstances in Chad, particularly the lack of progress towards a political solution in the conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">We are concerned that there is little information on this mission.  We have no information on its mandate or financing and we have real concerns about its aim.  Major General Pat Nash is to take over command of the EU military operation preparing to deploy in Chad and the Central African Republic.  I should congratulate him because it is an honour when an Irish citizen gets the recognition deserved for the position we have taken in the past.  However, General Nash will be based at operation headquarters in Paris with a French officer taking over in the operations theatre.  The bulk of the EU forces will be French.  Despite the great contribution the French made to the EU in recent times, we are concerned about France playing such an important role in this force considering its previous role in the area as an imperial power.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Will the Taoiseach tell the House whether the agreement to send Irish troops to Chad was cobbled together with Nicholas Sarkozy during the recent rugby match between France and Ireland?  What are the benefits which accrue to the Taoiseach?  Many questions about the Chad regime are raised and much of its record is politically suspect.  I urge caution.  I only have two minutes to speak on this matter and I welcome the opportunity to do so.  We must examine other aspects of this mission and according to the Order Paper we will return to it if more than five members are sent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
          <p eId="para_612">I thank all Members of the House for taking this motion so expeditiously, for their contributions and for recognising the importance of Ireland's and the Defence Forces' contributions to international peace and security.  As I outlined in my initial presentation, this is an extremely important mission for the EU and Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The proposed EU operation will be undertaken under UN authorisation and will be the largest EU mission yet to be deployed.  The Defences Forces will welcome the kind sentiments of the Deputies and their praise for the difficult work they undertake in furtherance of international peace.  Ireland's contribution to this mission is a clear manifestation of the importance the Government attaches to the development of EU capabilities in the areas of crisis management and peacekeeping in support of the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">I will not have time to deal with all the points made by Deputies.  Deputy Deenihan raised the issue of airlift capabilities.  As I explained last week during Question Time, this will come about in two ways.  We have an arrangement with commercial aircraft and our partners in missions sometimes get involved.  At present, air support to the mission is being addressed at EU level.  Appropriate re-supply arrangements for all troops will form part of the planning process for the mission which will be co-ordinated by General Nash.  Planning for the mission is in the early stages.  Requirements for strategic lift, tactical lift by helicopter and close air support will be examined as part of the risk assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Deputy Coveney requested that reports made by General Nash during the build-up to the operation should be laid before the Dáil.  I understand the recommendations of the operational commander are made to the political and security committee of the EU Council, not to me.  I will inquire as to whether it is possible to obtain those reports and if so have them laid before the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Deputy Coveney also raised the matter of a proper deployment for Darfur and I agree with what he stated.  The projected size of this mission is approximately 30,000 troops, mainly from the African continent.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Deputy O'Shea requested an assurance that people under 18 years of age will not be involved in hostilities.  Army regulations prevent people under 18 years of age from being sent abroad.  I reiterate the assurance I gave last week that there is no circumstance under which people under the age of 18 can be actively involved in hostilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Deputy O'Shea also wondered whether we would continue after one year if it was strongly recommended that we do so.  The situation will be reviewed in approximately six months and we will consider the outcome of the review.  It is likely that a continuation after the initial 12-month period would involve a UN-led mission rather than an EU mission.  Deputy O'Shea and other Deputies were concerned that every possible precaution be taken to ensure the safety of our troops and they can rest assured this will be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Deputy Chris Andrews was concerned about troops being deployed on foreign soil and the difficulties to which this gives rise.  The EU operation is authorised by the United Nations.  Just as importantly, it is at the request of the Governments of Chad and the Central African Republic.  There is no question of the force being deployed unilaterally by western countries or previous colonial powers.  The operation has no role in supporting the Chadean Government.  Its sole role is to protect refugees.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Deputy Barrett is unhappy with the idea that certain people can opt out from common costs, but if they do so they must opt out at Council.  To date we have no record of anyone opting out in this way.  I take on board the Deputy's point.  Deputy Timmins reminded us of the risk and the fact that this mission and responsibility should not be undertaken lightly.  We should not presume the outcome of the risk assessment or further Government decisions regarding troops.  We do not want to pre-empt those.  If there is a decision to deploy, that will be discussed fully by the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Deputy Timmins also raised the main responsibilities of the mission.  I dealt with that matter on the last day at Question Time, but I will deal with it again when discussing the actual deployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">I thank Members for their contributions and the very constructive tone of the debate.  People have given me some suggestions that we can usefully look at.  I commend the motion to the House.  I remind Members that the motion is to approve the appointment of Major General Nash as the force commander.  We will come back to the House if we are deploying troops.</p>

          <p eId="para_625">expresses its deep concern at the death of two fire-fighters during the course of a fire in Bray, County Wicklow on 26 September;</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_635">I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of family members of the two deceased members of the retained fire service along with their colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">The entire country has been shocked by the deaths of sub officer Brian Murray and fire fighter Mark O'Shaughnessy who died in the line of duty fighting a fire in Bray.  The tragic events of 26 September once again remind us of the risks that members of the fire service throughout the land face on a daily basis.  Their job is one of duty that is underpinned by the courage of going to work each day having to deal with and manage dangerous and life threatening situations.  In the period following this recent tragedy people all over the country have rightly once again acknowledged the courage of members of the full-time and retained fire services in every part of Ireland, and upon whom we all depend for our safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">However during this period of sadness and public sympathy, a number of serious issues have also been raised by the Bray fire deaths.  Colleagues of the two men have called for an independent investigation into their deaths and the Government should respond to this call.  In addition, we believe the Dáil and the public are entitled to an explanation as to why so many of the recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks review of fire safety and fire services, submitted to the Government in January 2002, have not yet been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">One of the key recommendations in that report was the establishment of a national authority for fire and civil protection/emergency services.  Unfortunately the Government has refused to act on it and it is time to accept that such an over-arching structure for the fire service is now essential.  It also time to recognise that despite the bravery and commitment of retained fire-fighters, some retained fire services are no longer adequate to provide the level of protection required in areas of high population and of high risk.  The motion seeks a commitment to the introduction of full-time fire services for Bray and other such areas of high population and of high risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">In the period following the tragic deaths of sub officer Brian Murray and fire-fighter Mark O'Shaughnessy information has entered the public domain that clearly demonstrates the need for an independent investigation.  This is information with regard to the staffing levels, difficulties in rostering arrangements and the time in which the Bray Fire Service was able to dispatch itself to attend to the fire and how dispatch systems between different local authorities operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">In the aftermath of this tragedy what must be examined are the resources that were available to the men, such as breathing apparatus and procedures, along with hydraulic platforms, the ability to put in place a command and control system, all of which indicate that there were difficulties with a shortage of personnel at the scene in deploying these resources.  All of these concerns raise crucial questions that must be answered.  It is not enough to say, as has been said, that things may not have been any different whether the firemen who went out on duty on 26 September where part-time or not.  Such a speculative statement is by no measure of means an acceptable response to what happened on that day.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">These questions can only be answered through the process of an independent investigation in which a full account of the day's events are examined in the full context in which the tragedy occurred.  An investigation is owed to the families of these men, their colleagues, the broader fire service, the local community and society as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">There is a narrative leading up to this tragic event that goes back to the Stardust fire in 1981. Unfortunately a recurring theme of that narrative is one in which the State has not strategically responded.  Instead it has at times been crisis driven and at other times consistently failed to act upon many of its own recommendations.  For instance, following the Fire Services Act 1981, the Stardust tribunal report was published in 1982.  Although the terms of reference for the tribunal did not provide for a general review of the fire service it did, however, make a number of key recommendations which had implications for the fire service as a whole.  These included that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should have overall central responsibility for the fire-fighting and fire prevention services provided by the local authorities, the Minister should establish an inspectorate for the fire service with three distinct areas of responsibility, supervision of all fire-fighting services in the country, supervision of fire prevention and fire protection measures in the State and to establish and maintain a national training centre for fire personnel.  The inspectorate should prescribe standards of fire cover to be provided by all local authorities.  While some other aspects of the tribunal recommendations have been implemented these three key primary points of the report are still outstanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">In recent years, another major piece of research has been carried out on restructuring of the fire service.  A report entitled a Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland by Farrell Grant Sparks for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was published in 2002.  This was the first report of its kind for over two decades and the review noted that "given this lengthy gap it should not come as a surprise to anyone that major change now needs to be implemented".</p>
          <p eId="para_644">In particular the review made a number of recommendations for structural change, chief among these, and not so coincidently, was a recommendation earlier indicated in the Stardust tribunal report, namely the creation of a national fire authority.  The central recommendation of the Farrell Grant Sparks review was the establishment of a national fire authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">In making recommendations the review identified a number of minimum core requirements to the structural model for the planning, development and delivery of fire and civil protection/emergency services functions.  These were the provision of a strong and integrated focus at national level including the provision of the required competencies and capability, the extension of the concept of regionalisation beyond the communications and mobilisation functions currently co-ordinated at that level in order to achieve greater efficiency, effectiveness and value for money and strengthened, better resourced and more effective arrangements at local fire authority level operating in a more consistent manner and delivering a higher quality of service.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">At a national level it recommended that the functions currently discharged by the fire services and emergency planning section of the Department, the fire advisory staff of the Department, and the Fire Services Council "should be brought together into a single unified structure".</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The review further set out to recommend the need to establish a new fire and civil protection/emergency services authority to implement the recommendations.  In effect this recommended re-titling the Fire Services Council as the Fire and Civil Protection/Emergency Services Authority and, most importantly, expanding its role and remit and integrating into the structure the other staff and resources in the Department currently devoted to fire and emergency planning functions.  The review went on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_648">The task of bringing about real change in structures, organisational arrangements, operations, culture and people development with a view to impacting on reductions in fires, fire deaths, injuries and social and economic loss from fire and other emergencies should not be underestimated.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_649">It is, we believe, essential that the core outcome from this Strategic Review will be a headline message, signalling the seriousness of intent to tackle current short-comings, through the establishment of a new Authority to develop, lead and direct a new departure for Fire and Civil Protection/Emergency Services functions in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">At a regional level it was proposed that three regionally based control centres in the east, the south and the west should be developed, capable of serving the mobilisation and communication needs of the fire authorities in these regions.  Taking on board concerns it did not recommend any change to the existing statutory role of the fire authorities.  Even at a local level the review demonstrated that the enhanced remit of the local fire and civil protection and emergency services authorities would allow for chief fire officers to have, where appropriate, direct delegation of powers, authority, responsibility and accountability to cover the functions assigned to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">In examining the retained fire service's role in the new national structure, it saw it as continuing to play a vital role.  However, it also saw its capacity to do so as under threat from difficulties such as recruitment, retention and securing release from employers of personnel in the retained fire service.  In response it recommended a concerted programme of support and development for the retained service as being necessary were it to continue to play a much needed role in the regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The motion before us this evening places a high value on the service provided by the retained fire service and recognises the vital role it plays in fighting fires and protecting lives and property in local communities across the country.  However, the events in Bray clearly demonstrate that the intended historical role of this service in many parts of Ireland has now become so extended that it now requires upgrading to a full-time fire service in areas of high population and high risk.  We now require a full risk assessment approach to be carried out in areas of high population, which also present high risk factors as has been witnessed by the tragic events in Bray.  There are many other examples where a risk assessment would clearly show that full-time fire services are also urgently required in other parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">For example in county Cork, the largest in Ireland, there is only one full-time fire service which serves the city and immediate regions by agreement.  The rest of the county is dependent upon a retained service.  Mayo, the second largest county in Ireland, while being a control centre for the western region, has no full-time fire service at all.  To expand upon the point, probably the greatest example in the country of the absence of a proper risk assessment approach is the lack of a full-time fire service in the town of Carrigaline.  Were a proper risk assessment carried out in this locality it would show that the region has 11 Seveso sites and the highest number of pharmaceutical plants in Ireland.  Furthermore the town of Carrigaline, which is in the flight path of Cork Airport, has grown so extensively, from a population of 700 people in 1971 to 15,000 today, as to be now completely unrecognisable today from the town it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">In the time since the review was published in 2002 we have had four Ministers in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, three in previous administrations and now the Minister, Deputy Gormley, in the present one.  When considering his predecessor's records, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in announcing the publication of the report commented:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_655">The weaknesses identified in the report will have to be addressed.  The new approach recommended in the report will have many positive benefits both for full-time and retained fire services personnel throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">In concluding his comments he gave a clear commitment stating his first priority was to move towards implementation of the recommendations of the report that fell under his direct remit.  However, when the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, moved on from this Department the key recommendation to create a national fire authority had not been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">His successor as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, when eventually announcing the creation of a national fire authority in 2004 said that it was his determination to do it within his tenure in the Department.  He went on to say that he had no intention of going anywhere except remaining in the Custom House.  Six months later his successor as Minister, Deputy Roche, reversed that decision choosing instead to set up steering groups to drive what he described as change.  We now have a new Minister in Deputy Gormley, and this evening's motion affords him the opportunity, if he is willing, to set about fully implementing this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">If we also examine and breakdown the present structure we see that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, county and city managers, locally elected politicians, chief fire officers, various individual fire authorities and the National Safety Council are involved.  All these bodies represent components of how fire firing and prevention is managed and delivered today.  All these individual components work to the best of their ability but not as one single co-ordinated unit.  The motion calling for the establishment of a national authority would address this obvious problem and ensure uniformity of structure, training and service delivery across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">In my opening remarks I commented upon a narrative leading up to the tragic events of 26 September 2007 that goes right back to the Stardust fire in 1981.  An unfortunate and recurring theme of that narrative is one in which the State has not strategically responded to these tragedies.  Rather it has at times been crisis driven and sadly consistently failed to act upon many of its own recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The motion before us this evening gives us an opportunity to show that eventually the lessons have been learnt.  The motion gives an opportunity in which this House can rise above the usual and expected responses of Government and Opposition debate.  It is an opportunity to demonstrate clearly that the tragic events of 26 September in Bray have at last begun to set into motion the examination and creation of a fire service that meets the needs of today's Ireland.  Most of all it is an opportunity to put in place the type of fire authority that the brave personnel of our fire services deserve and which we as a modern society should expect.  I call on all Members of the House to support the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_661">I also acknowledge the presence of members of the Murray and O'Shaughnessy families and their friends along with members of the fire service who are in the Gallery.  I thank the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Gilmore, for ensuring that this motion is debated tonight.  When a terrible tragedy occurs it is important that it be acknowledged here in our national parliament.  In this instance a terrible tragedy occurred when two fire fighters lost their lives in the line of duty.  It occurred on 26 September in the town of Bray which I represent and in which I live.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Like every other resident I enjoy the protection and security provided by the men and women of the fire service in Bray.  Over generations we have been proud of them and grateful to them.  Now we grieve with them and offer whatever consolation we can.  The death of two fine young men Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy has shocked and stunned our community to the core.  Fire fighting always carries risks but a tragedy like this demands a response from the Government so that some good can come from this calamity.  That is the purpose of our motion.  I am disappointed that, instead of accepting this motion, the Government wants to amend it so that it will become essentially an empty gesture if passed.  I am calling on all Deputies regardless of party affiliation to support the motion which sets out in concrete terms what must be done to provide a high quality fire service nationally as well as ensuring that areas of larger population, including Bray, will have a full-time fire service at last.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I say at last because this issue of a full-time service for Bray is not a new one.  There have been other heavy losses of life in the past in our town — the deaths in the Cassidy family and in 2002 the deaths of Teresa and Christopher Cahill in particular.  What was inexplicable to most people was that these fires occurred in a housing estate just across the road from the fire station.  They led to a campaign spearheaded by Margaret Cahill, Teresa's sister.  I pay tribute to Margaret Cahill and those around her on the action committee for a full-time fire service for their steadfast and at times lonely stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">When this issue was debated by Wicklow County Council and Bray Town Council in 2001 much emphasis was placed on the expected publication of the Farrell Grant Sparks, FGS, report to ensure the right decisions would be made to meet the need.  The report was published in 2002 and it recommended a new authority and new standards for the fire service nationally.  It had the support of firefighters and fire chiefs and we waited for Government action but it never came.  Five years on we are still waiting.   A feasibility study was prepared by Wicklow County Council outlining various options.  It was carried out with good intentions and I acknowledge the initiative of the then chairman, Joe Behan, who is now a Member of this House.  However, in its amendment, the Government is using that feasibility study, which was presented in good faith, to avoid making decisions and that is simply not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Family members have stated that both Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy had spoken of the great need for a full-time fire service in Bray.  Mrs. Murray revealed that only a week before the fire Brian had warned that a firefighter or a member of the public would die by the end of the year unless the fire service was overhauled.  As their families mourn them, there is a strong desire among them and across the community that some good should come out of their awful loss.  It is a mark of respect to both men that we raise this issue now.  I was very struck by the oration at the graveside of Brian Murray when it was said that when a crisis occurred he always responded by saying, "We must do something".  When 11 September occurred, he did something practical to raise support for the New York firefighters.  The irony is that, comparatively on a population basis, Bray has suffered as great a loss of firefighters as New York did on 11 September.  Brian's spirit lives on in his family in its clear and determined support for a full-time service so that something tangible and real can come out of such pain and loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">As a young man dedicated to his profession who loved his job, Mark O'Shaughnessy also understood its importance.  He epitomised the professionalism of the fire fighter and he wanted a full-time service in Bray.  We need equal determination on the part of the Government to bring in the reforms set out in the FGS report, which the then Government promised to introduce five years ago.  The then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, acknowledged that 25 years had passed since there had been reforms and he said at the launch of the report:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_667">With the passage of time and having regard to the vastly changed circumstances since the current regime was put in place, it was to be expected that service would be in need of a major overhaul at this point.  The weaknesses identified in the report will have to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The report recommended the establishment of a new national authority for fire and emergency planning services.  New structures were also recommended at local authority level which would mirror the arrangements at national level.  The report recommended bringing existing local authority fire services and building control functions together and ensuring more accountability.  It also recommended national standards.  The then Minister accepted the report stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_669">My first priority will be to move towards implementation of the recommendations in the report which fall under the sole ambit of my Department and to consider how best to finance them.  I will also discuss with my colleagues in Government, some of whose Departments are affected by the Report's recommendations, how best to carry those recommendations forward.  I look forward to full co-operation from staff in the fire services where the Report recommends a significant shift in the way in which business is done — in particular a new interface with local communities.  If the fire service is to prosper and to realise the potential seen for it in the Report, all stakeholders will have to press ahead in a genuine spirit of partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I hope a genuine spirit of partnership is entered into in facing up to our responsibilities.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, reappointed the then fire services council for a further six months to enable discussions and consultations to proceed and to progress arrangements for the new national fire authority.  He clearly envisaged it would take six months to implement but, almost six years later, progress has not been made to live up to that promise and it has taken the deaths of two brave men to bring this issue to centre stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The FGS report set out the changing role of the fire service.  Bray is a typical town, with a population of more than 30,000, which has changed and developed over recent decades.  Its catchment area extends to Kilmacanogue and Enniskerry and its rural hinterland must also be serviced by the fire service.  The submission made by the action committee for a full-time service in the town on the feasibility study is worth reading.  I urge the Minister to read it because it defines in detail the needs of our area in terms of a full-time fire service.  I have served as a councillor and I understand concerns about the cost local authorities must bear but the Government must deal with that.  It is untenable that in a country as well off as ours such concerns are expressed and cost can prevent the establishment of the very best fire service nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The opening of the Ritz Carlton hotel in Enniskerry was postponed because of the deaths of Brian and Mark.  When it eventually took place, the Taoiseach pointed out in his speech that the hotel cost €200 million to build.  How is it we live in a society that can spend €200 million, albeit in privately raised money, on a luxury hotel while the same amount would provide almost 100 years of full-time service in Bray?  Where are our priorities?  This tragedy has set us a challenge, which must be met to ensure progress is made and good comes out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The debate is not about blame.  I have been asked by members of the media to apportion blame and to turn this into a political football but I have no intention of doing so.  That would not do any good but it must be ensured that, while the issue is debated in our national Parliament and goes on public record for future generations to read, the Government responds to the motion in a way that matches the need.  We should all share support for action to meet the requirements of a highly quality fire service, including a full-time service in areas of heavy population, including Bray.  We should be able to come together on this motion.  If we do, there would be no better or more fitting memorial to the memory of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy and clearly it is the one they would have wished for themselves.  I regret that we are having the debate in these circumstances but it is important that we acknowledge their sacrifice and the contribution of every fire-fighter and that we live up to the task they have set us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_216">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_674">I thank the Labour Party for facilitating me in contributing to this debate.  In supporting this motion, I begin by adding to the tributes paid to the Bray firemen, Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy.  On behalf of my party colleagues in the Oireachtas and of the organisation throughout the island, we offer our deepest sympathy to their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">Their deaths remind us that fire fighting is a dangerous job.  The attendance at their funerals and the outpouring of public sympathy were proof of the great esteem in which fire-fighters are held by the entire community.  This makes it all the more important that the fire service is properly resourced, equipped and trained.  It is unfortunately the case that fire-fighters are sometimes attacked during the course of their duty.  All Members are aware of incidents in their community where fire-fighters responding to calls in certain areas come under attack.  This is disgraceful and wrong and it must stop.  Hopefully, the Bray tragedy will cause those responsible to reflect on their actions, particularly as Hallowe'en, which can be a particularly difficult time of the year for fire crews, approaches.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">In supporting the motion's call for the establishment of a national fire authority, I emphasise that this is something my party has called for since 2004, a position we share with SIPTU, which represents Dublin firemen.  Fire-fighters themselves recognise the need for an integrated training programme and common standards across the State.  They are aware that the best way to ensure this is to establish a national fire authority with the responsibility to put those standards into place.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The failure to date to establish such an authority is puzzling as it would seem to require little ingenuity or initiative on the part of the Government.  Failure to do so, however, not only affects the local service but also means that this State is in the embarrassing position of being unable to participate in international co-operation efforts.  Other states do not believe Irish fire-fighters are trained to take part in operations, such as those in response to earthquakes and other natural disasters, because of the lack of a national training programme.  That is not the fault of our fire-fighters but of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">This lack of national co-ordination led to the embarrassing situation in April where fire-fighters from Dublin were brought in to deal with a fire on a ship off the Kerry coast.  It is the case, however, that the Tralee fire service is fully equipped and has a trained crew to deal with chemical fires.  I can only imagine that the decision was less of a calculated insult to the Kerry service than a simple lack of knowledge that the necessary expertise was available.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Another aspect of the unevenness of training is that the Dublin fire service is the only one in which all members are trained paramedics.  This training must be extended to all parts of the country.  It is mind boggling that fire-fighters throughout the island, with the exception of Dublin, have not had the opportunity to train as paramedics.  In most cases where fire-fighters are called to the scene of serious accidents and so forth, such training is of invaluable importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">There is also the issue of risk assessment, the absence of which at local level could prove to be disastrous in certain circumstances.  For example, the Dublin fire service responded to an average of 200 calls per day in 2004.  It is a credit to the service that its members were able to respond in such a professional manner to this challenge.  However, the demands placed on the service could easily overstretch the available resources.  It is vital that an up-to-date risk assessment is carried out so that resources can be tailored to likely demand.  At a time when the fire service is in the news, it would be opportune for the Government to commit itself to ensuring that such risk assessments are carried out in every county.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Fire-fighters with whom Sinn Féin has spoken have also expressed dissatisfaction at the amount and condition of service vehicles and other equipment.  They particularly stressed the inadequacy of the fire brigade ambulance fleet in Dublin, which they say would be unable to cater for even a small number of major incidents occurring at the same time.  We must listen to what they have to say and act upon it.  My party has called for an expansion of the fleet and the creation of a single ambulance service in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The motion refers to the failure to implement the recommendations of the 2002 review conducted by Farrell Grant Sparks.  Why such a review should have been commissioned if it was merely to be allowed gather dust is a mystery.  Some of those involved in the service believe it merely confirms the ongoing indifference displayed by the Government towards the service.  In the light of recent sad events, it is timely to set about implementing the recommendations of that review as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">In the course of research for today's debate, I reviewed several press releases I have issued on this matter in recent years.  One of these, dated 19 June 2006, reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_684">It is clear that without substantial changes, a disaster — where our overstretched fire service is unable to respond adequately, resulting in substantial, and unnecessary loss of life — is not merely likely, it is inevitable.  Despite repeated promises, the Government has failed to implement necessary reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I further asserted in this statement that the Government must stop prevaricating and ensure that the fire brigade service and its staff are fully supported so that we can have a service to meet our demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Sinn Féin believes there is an urgent need for a State-wide co-ordinating body for the 37 local fire authorities in the Twenty-six Counties.  There are differences in training, equipment, policy and methodology across the local fire authorities, with approximately 220 fire stations in the Twenty-six Counties.  The lack of such a body may explain the lack of emphasis placed by the Government on the fire services in contrast to other emergency services.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">While reiterating the necessity of co-ordination between the various fire brigades in this State, my party would also like to see greater co-operation between the fire services on both sides of the Border.  As with ambulance and accident and emergency services, such co-operation is a matter of common sense, makes for greater efficiency and, above all, improves the response rate of the emergency services.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The importance of the service provided by fire-fighters cannot be emphasised enough.  No words of mine can adequately express the support they give us all.  In the aftermath of the supreme sacrifice made by Brian and Mark to provide a vital service to their community, it is of great importance that we listen to the views of fire service staff.  A national fire authority must be established and a co-ordinated approach devised to deal with the deficiencies in our service.  Fire service staff must receive the resources to which they are entitled, and we all must work collectively to provide them with the support they needs to do their job.  We must not act without consulting fire-fighters themselves as it is they who know what is required and who face the dangers every day.  Reform can no longer be delayed.  If we do not make the necessary changes, we will dishonour the sacrifice made by Brian and Mark.</p>

          <p eId="para_701">notes that the options for fire service provision in Bray and its environs are under consideration, including public consultation, by Wicklow County Council and that arrangements for the provision of fire services in all areas of the country are a matter for</p>
          <p eId="para_702">the relevant fire authorities, which expend an estimated €240 million per annum in the provision of the service."</p>
          <p eId="para_703">I again express my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy who tragically lost their lives in the fire in Bray last Wednesday week.  My sympathies are also with their fire service colleagues in Bray and throughout the country.  I pay tribute to their service to the community and to their professionalism.  All who knew Mark and Brian have testified to their commitment to family and community.  In debating this issue, we should be sensitive to the grief and pain their families, friends and colleagues are going through during these sad days.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I spoke to some of the crew in the aftermath of the tragedy and have arranged to meet with them again soon.  I am also happy to meet the families of Mark and Brian if they wish to do so.  I also take this opportunity to remember and pay tribute to fire-fighter Michael Listen and Garda Brian Kelleher, who tragically lost their lives in Foynes earlier this year, and to remember their families and colleagues tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">The retained fire service are dedicated people who make themselves available to respond to emergencies in their communities. They are well trained, well equipped and very professional.  Members of the fire services, both full-time and retained, do a very difficult job and we owe them a great debt of gratitude.  The fire services exist to serve the public and they serve it well.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">For our part, we as ordinary citizens are extremely fortunate we have in this country a fire service we can rely on and which never lets us down.  The fire service has never shirked its responsibilities and has readily accepted the challenges which constant change presents.  These personnel serve their communities faithfully and effectively.  They show courage and bravery in facing and dealing with emergency situations.  I wish to record my thanks and that of the Government for this selfless public service and acknowledge their pain during this period of loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The role of the fire-fighter is much different from what it was 30 years ago.  The job now includes dealing with road collisions and numerous types of rescue situations, including water and hazardous material incidents.  Fire-fighters are often first on the scene but whatever the incident, their priority remains the same — dealing with human casualties and the protection of human life.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Six years ago, it was recognised by my Department that a major review of our fire services was needed.  This review was seen as being necessary to take into account the changing role of our fire-fighters, the increased knowledge and expertise internationally regarding rescue services and the economic and social development that had taken place in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The review was carried out by Farrell Grant Sparks, which reported in January 2002.  The report, entitled Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland, was the starting point for what has become known as the fire services change programme.  Among the principal recommendations for change were more focus on fire safety, including the introduction of community fire safety initiatives; the enhancement of fire safety legislation; and better enforcement of both building control regulations and fire safety, including "during performance" inspections.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">There was to be the adoption of a new risk-based approach to determining emergency cover; new approaches and structures for major emergency management; the introduction of a competency-based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression; and a competency-based training regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">In addition, there was to be enhancement of the service through a continued high level of capital investment to improve infrastructure; further development of safety, health and welfare arrangements; better co-ordination of resources between neighbouring local authorities; more flexible deployment of staff at all levels; and the establishment of a national fire and civil protection authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The previous Government launched a fire services change and modernisation programme in 2005 to advance the key recommendations of the report regarding fire safety and fire services.  The aim of the programme has been to introduce measures aimed at bringing about significant improvement in the safety of people, including fire-fighters and property.  It involved developing a programme of key projects in four priority areas identified in the review.  These were community fire safety; competency-based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression; enhanced safety, health and welfare; and the development of a risk-based approach to emergency cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">A status report on the fire services change programme outlining the progress achieved in these four areas was published in June 2007 and is available on my Department's website.  The first phase of the programme, which focused initially on the enhancement of fire-fighter health, safety and welfare, has been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Further important programmes to provide the best support and guidance possible to assist fire-fighters in their work have also been developed and are currently being rolled out.  These include an updated ancillary safety statement template for the fire service to comply with the most recent 2005 health and safety legislation; a new national incident command system; revised  breathing apparatus guidelines and associated training and materials; and a critical incident stress management system to assist fire-fighters in dealing with the aftermath of traumatic and stressful incidents, such as the recent tragedy.  Considerable progress has also been made in a number of other key areas and these will be outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">In launching the first phase of the change programme, the previous Government agreed that the priority should be on achieving the widely accepted changes recommended by Farrell Grant Sparks.  The programme would provide an opportunity for all stakeholders to show commitment to the necessary change and, depending on the outcomes of the process, the question of how to build the structures necessary to support and embed change on a more permanent basis could be reconsidered.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The establishment of a national fire authority was considered prior to the launch of the change programme and has again been the subject of debate since the Bray tragedy.  There are a number of differing views on the merits of a fire authority.  As the first part of the change programme has been completed, I am reviewing the progress achieved and I am considering all of the options.  The Government must have regard to the needs of the fire service and the greater public interest, and I am determined to consider all aspects in reaching my conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The provision of a fire service is the statutory responsibility of the local fire authority, in this case Wicklow County Council.  The fire authority is required under section 10 of the Fire Services Act 1981 to make provision for the delivery of fire services in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade and adequate provision for reception of and response to calls for the assistance of the fire brigade.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The provision of a full-time fire service for Bray has been a matter of public debate for some years now.  I am aware that Wicklow County Council's chief fire officer has prepared a report for the local authority on options for fire service provision in Bray.  This report was put out for public consultation in Wicklow and is being considered by the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I take this opportunity to clarify a number of points on fire service provision.  Currently, full-time fire brigades operate in larger urban areas, specifically the cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  The number of turnouts where a full-time service exists is in excess of 1,000 a year.  The Farrell Grant Sparks report, Review of Fire Safety and Fire Services in Ireland, recommended the development of a risk-based approach to fire cover standards.  The report envisaged that this new approach will help identify risk patterns and vulnerable sectors of the community and help local authority management in the determination of cover and allocation of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Under the change programme, the development of a risk-based approach to emergency cover was one of the areas included for advancement.  During the process it was changed to a risk-based approach to fire safety management to reflect the need for integration of safety initiatives with emergency response.  The procurement process is under way and when the process is completed and a contractor is in place, fire authorities will have assistance to carry out a risk analysis in their functional areas in accordance with the system and to determine the allocation of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">There have been calls over the past few days for an independent investigation into the Bray tragedy.  Three investigations are under way, carried out by An Garda Síochána, the Health and Safety Authority and Wicklow County Council.  I have asked each of the authorities to make the findings of its investigation available to my Department and will consider any necessary change arising from the outcome of these in the work of supporting and developing fire services in my role as Minister.  It would be important to await the outcome of the investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">In conclusion, it is very difficult to debate these issues in the direct aftermath of such a tragedy.  In this regard, I appreciate the measured comments of Deputy McManus.  I emphasise that I will listen carefully to any arguments which emerge from the review and investigation process and I will act on the recommendations that emerge.  Uppermost in my mind and in the minds of everyone in this Chamber is the health and safety of the men and women in our fire service.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Tony Killeen)</from>
          <p eId="para_723">I wish to offer my sincere condolences to the families of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy and to their colleagues and friends in the Bray area.  It was clear to those of us who attended their funerals that they were held in the highest esteem.  The tragedy of their deaths brought home to all of us the tremendous work fire-fighters do, the risks they take and the level to which communities are dependent on them.  I also wish to pay tribute to Michael Liston and Garda Brian Kelleher who were victims of the Foynes tragedy earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">Local authorities provide fire services and the job of Government is to ensure the legislative framework is sound and to develop and support fire services throughout the country.  The Department's fire services capital programme is designed to put in place the infrastructure, including stations and fire appliances, to enable fire-fighters to do a good job and thereby support the local fire authorities in the development and maintenance of a quality firefighting and rescue service.  This commitment to and increased investment in the fire service has brought dramatic improvements in the fire service infrastructure nationally.  In the past 25 years, almost €240 million has been provided under the fire services capital programme throughout the State for the provision of new and refurbished fire stations and the purchase of fire appliances and other equipment.  At this stage, over two thirds of our fire stations, including almost all of the busier stations, have been replaced.  In addition, we have a modern fleet of frontline fire appliances and a modern communications system.  The local authorities spend some €240 million per year in operating the fire service.  There have been massive improvements affecting all areas of the service, including the employment of more staff, the provision of better training and the strengthening of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">There are some 3,400 people working in the fire service.  There are over 1,000 full-time fire-fighters in our major cities and over 2,000 retained staff who respond to protect their own communities when needed.  We have 170 senior personnel who lead the service.  Included in the latter are professional staff who examine all building plans for fire safety and carry out inspections of premises.  The work that has been done in this field is phenomenal and great credit is due to those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">In commenting in recent days, many people acknowledged the level of professional training our fire-fighters receive and noted the quality of their equipment.  Training provided locally is supplemented by the Fire Services Council, which runs an annual programme of training courses and seminars for senior and junior fire officers and for instructors who train the fire service personnel at local level.  Under the fire services change programme, a decision was made at the early stages of the competency module to link the fire services to the National Qualifications Authority and the Department has engaged with the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The principal job of the fire services is about protecting people, infrastructure, property and the environment from the threat of fire.  A number of measures have been taken in recent years to increase public safety and, consequently, reduce the risk to fire-fighters.  Building regulations have been in place since 1992.  This means that, during the construction boom, the design of all buildings other than private houses being built or modified must have undergone the fire safety certification process.  Since 1998, all new houses must have mains operated smoke alarms.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The Minister has already stated that a series of initiatives have been developed under the community fire safety programme, including a smoke alarm campaign and the primary schools programme.  From research, we know that there are in excess 300,000 homes in this country which do not have smoke alarms.  This figure does not include households which have alarms that are not working.  There are families that would not go to bed at night without locking their doors.  They would, however, do so without having working smoke alarms in place.  This is all the more surprising and worrying when one considers that it takes fewer than three minutes for someone to die of smoke inhalation.  The Department, with the assistance of the local authorities, is trying to target some of these vulnerable sectors.  The other sectors must be targeted through increasing awareness.  In that regard, I pay tribute to the voluntary and community sector for assisting the Department and local authorities in targeting people who might otherwise not be targeted as regards the use of smoke alarms.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The functions of the National Safety Council relating to the promotion of fire safety at a national level were returned to the Department in September of last year.  Since then, the Department has developed its own suite of fire safety promotion literature which is available from its website, local authorities and health centres throughout the country.  The Department also runs its own media campaign, which commences with national fire safety week.  The Bray tragedy occurred on the eve of national fire safety week, which was due to commence on 1 October 2007.  As a mark of respect to Brian Murray and Mark O' Shaughnessy, the Department's campaigns were postponed until after the funerals.  The Department's TV and radio advertising campaign was postponed until last night.  This campaign will run on all TV and radio stations until the end of the year.  It is hugely important in the context of bringing home to people the message that each of us has an individual responsibility to ensure that every provision relating to fire safety is in place in our own homes and at our business premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">A separate review of the major emergency management field resulted in the development of a new major emergency management framework in 2005 and the initiation of the major emergency development programme 2006-08.  This process has gone well beyond the Farrell Grant Sparks recommendation in this regard.  The fire service will play a key role in developing this programme and will ultimately be central to its roll-out and implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">Major emergency management is a key challenge and a priority issue for the Government.  The roll-out of the new framework will bring Ireland into line with international trends in this area.  The purpose of the new framework is to put in place new arrangements that will enable the three principal response agencies — local authorities, An Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive — to prepare for and make a co-ordinated response to major emergencies.  The framework is the foundation for the development of a new generation of major emergency plans by the principal response agencies.  It sets out the mechanisms for co-ordination at all levels of major emergency management — on site, local level and regional level, with links to national level major emergency management architecture when required.  I acknowledge the place of local authority fire services in major emergency management over the years and the work of city and county managers and senior fire officers in the development process.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">The major emergency development programme 2006-08 is currently being rolled out to implement the provisions of the framework.  It is the objective to have the process, including exercises and testing of the new updated plans, completed by autumn 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">On the one hand, this indicates that substantial work is under way but that this is somewhat short of completion.  An important element of our knowledge in this area undoubtedly relates to the 2007 review of the fire services change programme, to which the Minister earlier referred.  In the context of Bray and other tragedies, it is important to bear in mind the provisions of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which I steered through the Oireachtas some time ago and with which Members on all sides engaged at a level not frequently seen as regards legislation of that kind.  I have no doubt that HSA investigation will be independent and well-resourced and will prove hugely important regarding the kind of outcomes people expect and the concerns that have been expressed by earlier speakers and others who have made their views known in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">It is also important to bear in mind that all the key stakeholders in the fire service are participating positively in the fire services change programme and have bought into it to a great degree.  Great credit is due to people for facing up to the changes required.  In some instances, these changes impact negatively on people's lifestyles and require a level of investment of time that not everyone would be prepared to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">As already stated, the major emergency framework is hugely important and the fire service will have the key role in respect of its roll-out and implementation.  I was interested in the point made by Deputy Ferris regarding the fact the Dublin fire service responded to over 200 calls per day in 2004.  While, as the Deputy correctly states, this highlights the enormous job undertaken by fire-fighters on behalf of everyone in the community, it also indicates that the vast majority of the 200 calls per day relating to fire incidents could be prevented if we could put across the message relating to prevention as effectively as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">When I was appointed to the Department and looked at this area, I was shocked to find that approximately 300,000 homes are without a smoke alarm.  At the first fire services event I attended, I was even more shocked when I was shown a video of two fires which had occurred in Ennis in my own area.  In the case of one of the fires, a working smoke alarm prevented not just loss of life but minimised damage to such an extent that one would barely know that a fire had been responded to and dealt with.  In the other case, a non-working fire alarm was clearly visible on a worktop in the kitchen with a battery left alongside it that one presumes was out of action and in the process of being replaced sometime.  That brings to mind all the other houses, in addition to the 300,000 to which I referred, whose owners realised it was important to have a fire alarm but whose alarms were not operational because the batteries were not replaced or some difficulty was not addressed.  That is a great concern to anybody who looks at the kind of dangers fire-fighters are exposed to going about their work.  The more of us who, as citizens, fail to deliver on our duty to take preventive measures, the more people working in the fire service we put in danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The 2005 fire services change programme is being driven by a high-level implementation group to implement the main fire service and fire safety recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks report.  The view was taken initially that it was more important and a priority under the change programme to use available resources to bring about direct improvements.  It is true that the proposals for institutional change were not made a priority at that time.  As the Minister has said, he intends looking very carefully at all aspects of the fire service programme arising from this tragic incident and also on foot of the report that will undoubtedly be made available to the Department when the three investigations have been completed.  It is important that this is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">However, it was sound judgment initially to bring about direct improvements to areas that were immediately to the fore.  When the programme was launched, it advanced the key fire safety and fire services recommendations in four priority areas.  These areas were as follows: the enhanced safety and welfare of fire-fighters; community fire safety; a competency-based approach to recruitment, retention and career progression; and the development of a risk-based approach to emergency cover.  These are all very important areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">A number of project structures involving all the stakeholders were put in place to advance the programme.  The first phase of the programme has just been completed.  It focused on the enhancement of safety, health and welfare.  This mostly resulted from the provisions of the 2005 Act, to which I previously referred and which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle played a very active and important role in seeing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  An updated ancillary safety statement template for the fire service to comply with that legislation was put in place.  Other measures put in place included: a new national incident command system; revised breathing apparatus guidelines, associated training and training materials; and a critical incident stress management system to assist fire-fighters in dealing with the aftermath of traumatic and stressful incidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">The incident in Bray last week was undoubtedly the most traumatic and stressful incident that anybody in any line of work could be subjected to and an appalling situation for the colleagues of the two victims, Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy.  However, we must also remember that, on a daily basis, our fire-fighters are called out to road traffic accidents and fires involving fatalities and deal with extremely difficult, trying and stressful situations.  All of us on all sides of the House would agree that every provision that can be put in place to help them do that job effectively and safely without any negative impact on their own health and well-being should be put in place.  Whatever technical disagreement there might be among us in the House in respect of how this motion is dealt with, I have no doubt that, across all political parties and among all of us involved in this area, there is a willingness to move forward and address whatever shortcomings there may be.  We would all also acknowledge that considerable progress has been made and that in delivering that progress, we should not forget that chief fire officers and county managers, but particularly fire-fighting personnel, have played a key role.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">As I have said, considerable progress has been made under key areas, including a series of initiatives in the community fire safety area.  Key among them is the installation of smoke alarms in the homes of vulnerable and elderly persons.  We sometimes forget the tremendous role that the community and voluntary sector plays, very directly in the current campaign, in helping to target elderly and vulnerable people who do not have fire alarms and might not be aware that a scheme is in place.  Besides making the applications, the community and voluntary sector frequently helps in the provision and installation of the alarms.  It is very important that we pay tribute to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">In respect of the programme targeted at third class, I pay tribute to all those firemen who have gone out to schools throughout the country.  I know that last year, every primary school in County Clare was visited and every third class pupil was visited by people from the fire brigade.  They make a significant impact.  Last week, I visited the school in which I taught for a number of years.  Two fire-fighters were there speaking to third class pupils.  Of course, in a small country school, it was not just third class pupils who were affected.  Everybody in the school was eager to see the firemen and what they were doing.  The message went home very strongly to parents in that community, as it did in every other community where the third class was visited, that we all have a responsibility in respect of our property to make provisions that are extraordinary inexpensive and readily available.  There are so many outlets where one can pick up a smoke alarm.  It is so easy to install and the battery lasts so long that none of us has any excuse for putting our families' lives or our property in danger, and just as little excuse for putting the lives of very brave fire-fighters in danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">The Government is committed to continuing to implement the necessary changes to ensure that we have a world-class fire service.  Progress under the programme can be viewed in conjunction with the following: strengthened fire safety legislation of 2003, the major emergency development programme approved by Government arising from the review of the framework for major emergency management commissioned in 2004, the success of the capital investment programme which is very visible in all of the local refurbished and new fire stations throughout the country and the quality of the equipment which is on a par with best international standards, very importantly, the provision of relevant training to fire authorities supplemented by the central training programmes provided by the Fire Services Council and the strengthening of the management structure in local authorities, all of which have been done over a period of time to try to ensure we have the very best provision in terms of our capability to address fires and trying to ensure the safety of the very brave people who deliver that service to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Ultimately, this is a very big picture and programme and an area where it would be very wrong to point to one particular group and lay all the responsibility for delivering a better service on it.  There is no doubt that the Government has a key role to play in terms of the provision of legislation, providing the necessary framework and ensuring the finances are provided.  Equally, local authorities have their own responsibility for the delivery of services in a very direct way.  It is incumbent on all of us, particularly in the wake of these appalling tragedies, in memory of the two brave men and as a mark of respect to their families, to ensure that every effort is made to deliver the highest quality of service for the people of the country.</p>

        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_223">
          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_747">Fine Gael will be supporting the Labour Party motion in respect of this very important issue.  I am disappointed the Government has not seen fit to agree with the Opposition on a Private Members' motion for the second week running.  Tonight's important motion comes in the wake of a difficult tragedy in Bray.  It highlights, nonetheless, neglected issues in the emergency services over the years which have been articulated both by Members and the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I extend my sympathies to the families of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy.  They have brought to national attention the deficiencies in one of our essential emergency services.  One difficulty faced by the Government is that the emergency services are in rag order.  Whether it is health or the fire services, we cannot always depend on everything working as it should.  The Opposition, in a constructive manner, is trying to establish principles and good practice to ensure the recent tragedy in Bray does not happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">This issue goes back to 2001 when the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, recognised rightly there were problems in the co-ordination of emergency services.  He asked an expert group to examine how best services could be deployed in the fire and emergency services.  Farrell Grant Sparks was commissioned to report on the matter.  However, like so many reports commissioned by the Government, it had to be dusted down in recent days to see what was in it.  That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">A high level group and four committees were established to evaluate the competencies regarding the delivery of the fire and emergency services and the risks in each fire authority.  The recommendations of the risk-based committee achieved nothing, which crystallised itself in the recent events in Bray.  Arising from the appalling tragedy in Bray, there will be separate Garda, departmental and Health and Safety Authority investigations.  We can have all the investigations we like but do we learn lessons from them?  Sadly, based on the failure to implement the key recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks report, I will not hold my breath for the implementation of the new reports' recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">What is needed is an independent authority that will transcend local authority boundaries and will ensure people can rely on a fire service that will minimise risk.  The Fire Acts allow for cross-boundary treatment of fires.  In the case of the recent Bray fire, the full-time fire service of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown could have been called upon.  In spite of what the Taoiseach said, there is a difference between part-time and full-time services.  People in a part-time service must leave their place of work to attend a fire scene.  The Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown service, a full-time one, was eight minutes from the recent Bray fire.  Why was it not called upon?  This is one of many questions to which people want answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">It is not good enough for the Minister to throw everything back on the local authorities.  It is a requirement of the House to act on deficiencies in services.  I call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, to ensure recommendations from the Farrell Grant Sparks report are implemented.  We do not need any more reports.  The existing reports must be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">The Government amendment to the motion shows it is not committed to realise these objectives.  The core recommendation of the Farrell Grant Sparks report stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_754">A new authority at national level which will provide stronger national leadership, put in place a more integrated and coherent structure at the centre and which will lead, develop, implement and manage the performance of a new regime aimed at delivering better results.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The report also stated such an authority would establish these "new arrangements at local authority level which will integrate existing fire authorities and building control authorities into a unified structure".  This is the only way in which "a more focused and enhanced emphasis on prevention and mitigation as well as on operational emergency response capability".</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The Government must rethink these issues between now and the end of this debate.  The House can be united on this motion, in the memory of the recently deceased firefighters in Bray.  Doing so would allow us to be in a position to tell their families and those who work part time and full time in the service that there is a new policy position that will ensure confidence in our fire services.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_757">I wish to acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of family members and colleagues of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy.  The timing of the motion is appropriate, given that the deceased firemen's families are determined some good will come from this tragedy.  We must do our job as legislators without it becoming a political slagging match.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The Farrell Grant Sparks report is five and a half years old.  The tone of the language used in the report struck me.  It stated, "Our primary recommendation is that a new national authority for fire and civil protection/emergency services be established".  It continued: "We believe strongly that a single unified structure under the new authority is the optimum means of achieving coherent national leadership and development for the fire safety and fire services regime".</p>
          <p eId="para_759">To his credit, the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, put in place a structure which would have seen such a model rolled out over six months.  Five and a half years on, we still have 37 fire authorities and 222 fire stations.  Northern Ireland has a single fire and rescue service, divided into regional, area and district command centres.  For its own reasons Northern Ireland has developed an expertise in this area but the least we can do is examine it as a possible model which would have merit here.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">I acknowledge that many recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks report have been implemented.  However, I do not believe adequate resources are provided to the fire services.  Any rescue service that must analyse costs in dispatching a team is simply not working right.  People in the services will claim this attitude pertains.  Last week, the House debated how the recruitment embargo in the health services has affected recruitment of ambulance service personnel, despite the claim frontline services would not be affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">I welcome the Minister's willingness to examine aspects of the services and the establishment of an authority.  The report, however, claimed its primary recommendation was the establishment of this authority.  In itself it will not achieve anything other than a national protocol or command system.  In the context of the sentiments in his speech I ask the Minister to look at it.  The amendment tabled by the Government, in particular the last part of it, puts the responsibility in its entirety back on the local authorities and is completely at odds with the Minister's statement.  It ignores the Farrell Grant Sparks key recommendation and at the minimum it should be discounted.  We need a completely independent investigation into this whole tragedy and the circumstances surrounding it, with the right to make recommendations that will be acted upon.  As Deputy Hogan said, we have had key reports before, they were cherry-picked when it suited and key recommendations have not been implemented because it did not suit.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Unfortunately, I heard the phrase used last week in an interview with a former Minister to the effect that these were quangos.  When we want to put a question down to a quango such as the National Road Safety Authority, the Energy Regulator etc., we are told it is inappropriate for this House, since these are statutory organisations in their own right.  A national fire authority would have a similar mandate, to put in place the proper procedures and protocols for a world-class fire service, as outlined by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">I ask the Minister, once again, to support the motion tabled by the Labour Party.  I ask him again to reconsider the amendments tabled which render all the rhetoric as a joke.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_764">Like all speakers tonight, I extend my sympathy to the families of Brian Murray and Mark O'Shaughnessy on their recent tragic deaths.  These deaths have brought back to the forefront issues that should have been long since resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">I thank the Minister, Deputy Gormley, for his speech but he has not outlined adequately the reasons the Farrell Grant Sparks report has not been fully implemented to date.  He said the last Government, in 2005, launched a programme to advance the key recommendations of the report.  However, as far back as Deputy Martin Cullen's time as Minister, he promised he would implement the report.  The Taoiseach, in a letter to the fire chiefs in 2002 said that Fianna Fáil believed that the report's recommendations must be implemented without cherry-picking.  Sadly, it is clear that since that letter five years ago, there has been a substantial cherry-picking of recommendations.  I have been told that while some of the relatively easy recommendations have been implemented, the tougher, more costly ones, were not.  That is a serious point that needs to be teased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">I am sure the Minister is aware that one of the report's authors, Mr. Tom Murray, said that the key on which the report turned was the setting up of a national fire authority.  I very much support him in this and indeed the motion tabled here tonight by the Labour Party in that regard.  He said that to progress with other recommendations without this was to deal only with the symptoms rather than the main deficiencies which were institutional and structural.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Treating symptoms is just dealing with the tip of the iceberg.  The root of the problem must be tackled and we need to look at reality in this regard.  All experts in the area, including fire chiefs, seem to agree on some of these points.  Effectively, at national level we have no standards, monitoring or compliance checking.  The system being operated is outdated compared to that in many countries in Europe and around the world.  Regardless of such comparisons, it is outdated in any event.  We do not even have a clear mechanism for assessing risk right across the fire service.  Despite the clear recommendations in the Farrell Grant Sparks report, fire cover standards still operate on an area-based regime linked to speed of response rather than to risk associated to area.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The Bray tragedy has again thrown up the issue of full-time versus part-time or retained fire services.  The sad reality is that I cannot properly comment on this and, with the greatest respect, neither can the Minister.  Because we do not have a national fire authority we cannot assess what should be in place in Bray or indeed other towns around the country.  In some respects that provides a comfort blanket for the Government, which it can hide behind.  However, the ultimate responsibility for the fact that we do not know lies with Government.  Had a national fire authority been in place, at least we would have been aware of the standards which we needed to live up to and what each local authority must provide.  There is no comfort blanket for fire-fighters as the people who risk their lives in providing a service without proper standards being in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">Unfortunately many other towns such as Bray are in the same position.  I have done some checking on facts and figures and Tullamore has almost the same number of calls as Bray per annum and also operates on a retained service.  If a national fire authority was in place there would be clear criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">I wonder to what degree the Minister has examined the options.  Has he thought of day-manning some of the stations?  It is obviously difficult to get fire-fighters during the day, especially given the criteria that they need to live and work within a relatively short distance from the stations.  Then there is the issue of traffic problems and access to stations.  However, there are options such as having full-time crews in some areas during the day and a retained service at night.  I am not suggesting that this is what is needed in Bray or Tullamore.  Again, I do not have the expertise and there is no national authority to assess this.  There are difficulties as regards rural regions as well as built-up urban areas.  Some fire authorities find it difficult to recruit part-time fire fighters in rural areas, again because so many people travel to urban areas to work. While the number of call-outs might be relatively small in rural areas, fire-fighters must be available all the time and that presents problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The pace of Government roll-out facilities is still poor.  I welcome the fact that towns such as Birr and Edenderry in my constituency have new fire stations.  Birr waited nearly 20 years for it to happen, but other places, too, have problems.  Ferbane fire station is very antiquated and in desperate need of replacement.  It is a place of crucial geographical importance, serving the N62 west Offaly power region, Bord na Móna  and the whole peat area.  Clara also awaits the provision of a new fire station.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">I will return to the point Deputy Doyle referred to regarding the Minister's speech and throwing responsibility back on the local authorities.  I wrote to the Minister in July about Clara, following receipt of a report I had sought from Offaly County Council.  The council report informed me that the plans had been lodged in the Department for a number of years.  I knew that and wrote to the Minister to find out how matters were progressing.  The response was similar to that which I get from the Minister for Health and Children when I table questions about the HSE.  I specifically asked whether the Minister could look into the matter of the proposed plans and what stage they were at in the Department.  He wrote back to tell me it was a matter for Offaly County Council.  We could write to each other for another ten years on this and go around in the same circle.  Offaly County Council does not and will not have the funding to build a fire station either in Ferbane or Clara.  The Minister knows the money comes from his Department.  It is important when we raise these genuine queries on very important issues on behalf of people living in these areas that we get answers telling us, in effect, that the Minister is looking at the plan and at what stage it is at, rather than referring us back to the local authority which will not write the cheque to provide the service.  The provision of funding  for stations for equipment comes from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and that is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">The Act outlines the role of local authorities in terms of providing services, but the nuts and bolts of such provision must come from the Department.  I thank and congratulate all members of the fire service for the fantastic work they do in extremely difficult circumstances.  I ask the Minister, in the light of the work they do for what is a small return, to reconsider the Government's amendment and support the Labour Party's motion.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_226">
          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_774">I am sorry the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey, is not here to take this very important matter.  It shows the way he treats it.  However, I am delighted the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, is here on his behalf.  Being a Tipperary woman, she will be very supportive of what I have to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Weekend media reports reveal the Minister for Transport and the Marine is about to appoint two new directors to the board of Aer Lingus with a mandate to block the transfer of Heathrow slots from Cork and Dublin Airports and is set to abandon Shannon Airport to the west.  We all welcome the move to safeguard the slots at Cork and Dublin Airports but to abandon Shannon Airport and leave the entire region without connectivity to Heathrow is unbelievable and will not be accepted in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The Minister for Transport and the Marine told us we were exaggerating.  When he finally accepted there was a crisis, he said there was nothing he could do about it.  The Minister has told us it is too late for Shannon, but it is not.  Two weeks ago in the House, the Minister said the Government believed it would be inappropriate to intervene in the decision-making of a private company and that to do so ultimately would be damaging both to the company and its customers.  I remind the Minister for Transport and the Marine that he also said shareholders do not have the power to overrule management decisions on business matters.  He said this was based on legal advice.  Will he publish this legal advice so we can examine it?  It is extraordinary that the legal advice last week was that one cannot intervene but that, this week, the Minister will appoint two board members and, as quoted in the newspapers, he will not give management <i> carte blanche </i>in regard to what it could do with the slots.  The Minister, however, will not intervene in the Shannon issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Last week during the debate on Aer Lingus there were rumours that a new airline was coming into Shannon and that a deal would be done in the near future, but the reality is very different.  Anybody who knows the airline business will know that BMI had already committed two fleets flying long-haul to the Middle East and would not be in a position to change its aircraft rotations in respect of any incentive it was offered.  The rumour was just a face-saving spin coming from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The Minister is to appoint two directors to Aer Lingus which he should have done on his first day in office.  However, he failed to realise how important this was until my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, pointed it out to him.  Will the Minister appoint somebody from the mid-west to the board?  The mid-west has been marginalised at Government and board levels.  While various Government Deputies in the mid-west were happy to jump up and down in constituencies and talk about the issue, none stood by us in terms of their commitments when there was a crucial vote last week.  It is important the mid-west is given a voice at board level in Aer Lingus.  It would provide a direct input for the region at the forthcoming extraordinary general meeting to discuss fleet expansion.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Already a number of investments in the region have been cancelled.  Ballykilty Manor in Quin has put its expansion project on hold and this comes on top of the decisions by Dromoland and Doonbeg.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The reality is that Aer Lingus is the only airline in respect of the Heathrow slots.  There is no alternative.  If the decision by Aer Lingus is not reversed, it will have huge consequences for Shannon and the entire western region.  Day by day confidence is being diluted in our region and yet no action is being taken in defence of Shannon.  There are commitments to future investment in Transport 21 and there was a commitment in the tourism and economic development plan, but nothing has happened.  Not one cent has been spent on this promised tourism and economic development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Having conceded that it can intervene in Aer Lingus, I call on the Government to use its 25% shareholding in the company to have the Aer Lingus Shannon-Heathrow service restored.  Time is running out in terms of airline scheduling for 13 January 2008, but it is also running out for the Minister for Transport and the Marine and the Government on this issue.  It is a critical issue in the region and it will not go away.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_227">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_782">I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey.  Under the memorandum and articles of association, the State is entitled to appoint three directors to the board of Aer Lingus.  Currently, there is only one State appointed director serving on the board and it is now proposed that two further appointments be made.  The State's representatives will not, as has been reported, have a mandate to block any future slot transfers.  Under company law, all directors have legal responsibilities to protect the interests of the company which, in practice, means advancing the interests of all shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">Immediately after the IPO, Ryanair's attempted takeover bid was launched.  Under the applicable law, the State representative on the board was excluded from board meetings at which the takeover was discussed.  It would not have made any sense in such circumstances to have appointed all three State directors at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The circumstances are now different and it is appropriate to make those appointments in the near future.  The State appointees will seek to ensure that all future decisions of the company that have implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered and decided at board level.  This will give the State appointees the opportunity to raise the public policy implications of each decision and to ensure that the full commercial implications for the company are taken into account.  The State appointees to the board do not have a veto on board decisions.  It is not possible for the State, even as a shareholder, to seek to impose non-commercial obligations on the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Aer Lingus has stated that it made its decision to transfer the Shannon-Heathrow slots for commercial reasons and the company has confirmed that this decision is commercially robust.  Under company law it is not possible for the State or any other shareholder to overturn a decision taken by the company on day to day business matters.  The legal advice to the Government has been clear and unequivocal on this point.  The Minister has made it clear to the company that this decision goes against national aviation and regional policy, but it has made it clear that it will not change that decision.  By appointing our full board complement it will be possible to ensure that the full ramifications of all significant strategic decisions are fully discussed and decided by the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">In regard to connectivity, the report of the senior officials group, which has now been published, examined all the implications of the Aer Lingus decision.  It concluded that while the withdrawal of the Heathrow service is a loss to the Shannon region, the negative impact from a connectivity point of view almost completely relates to one stop connectivity and flight duration to key destinations in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Australia, as such destinations must generally be accessed through a major hub.  This has obvious adverse effects in terms of business travellers and other users from the Shannon region.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">However, the senior officials group confirms there should be little impact on connectivity with destinations in the Americas as the best route is as likely to be through one of the US hubs served directly from Shannon.  Services between Ireland and US are enhanced when one takes into account the link up by Aer Lingus with the US carrier, Jet Blue, which makes possible access to and from Shannon to 50 airports in the US, Mexico and the Caribbean.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">This is in addition to the new direct services being provided under the open skies arrangements.  In the case of European origins or destinations, the analysis found that there is no loss of one-stop connectivity but travel via Heathrow was found in general to be faster.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">The Minister commends the Shannon Airport Authority for its positive response to the current difficulties.  The authority has specifically identified airline services to the key European hub airports of London-Heathrow, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt as being of key strategic importance to its ongoing development.  The airport recently published a European hub airport incentive scheme for services to come into operation in 2008 which provides for significant discounts in airport charges and for the possibility of marketing support to be provided by Shannon Airport for new services.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">The Minister is very committed to ensuring that the mid-west region will continue to have the widest possible range of connectivity options available for the benefit of business and tourism throughout the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Arising from the Government's acceptance of the report, it is proposed that, taking account of the findings and the other issues addressed therein, the relevant Ministers, following consultation with the four mid-west planning authorities, together with the Mid-West Regional Authority, will report back to Government as soon as possible on strategies for unlocking the further development potential of the Limerick-Shannon gateway and its wider region.  This will be done in light of the substantial investment planned under the national development plan and Transport 21 to create an integrated infrastructure underpinning the region's competitive position.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_793">I thank the Minister for attending.  I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important issue concerning the provision of funding to enable the provision of vital additional accommodation at my old <i>alma mater</i>, Saint Brigid’s national school, Ballynacargy, County Westmeath, the roll number of which is 01731U.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">An application was made to the Minister's Department for funding under the devolved capital works scheme in respect of the small schools scheme 2007.  The scheme allows a maximum grant of €484,000 to carry out works that would cost approximately €600,000.  Unbelievably and somewhat bizarrely, and to the amazement of everyone, including the board of management, parents, principal and staff, the funding application was rejected due to financial constraints.  As I understood it, schools with absolute and demonstrated needs were approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">In the era of the Celtic tiger, in which the fruits of our economic success should be allocated to provide decent, adequate, warm and modern accommodation to give our children a good start in academic life, the Department found it was not essential to meet the needs of in excess of 90 children in Ballynacargy national school.  The board of management and teachers spent many hours planning, deliberating and consulting with regard to their initial application and subsequent appeal.  For the past few years, the teachers have diligently attended in-service days devoted to the implementation of the revised curriculum and returned to the school to try to implement the new approach, yet they find their attempts to implement it are handicapped severely due to inadequate space and resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">The 92 children in the school are currently accommodated in four classrooms of 30 sq. m while the recommended size of such rooms is from 48 sq. m to 60 sq. m.  The school, which is classified as disadvantaged, but with no concessionary post, has a full-time resource teacher accommodated in a converted cloakroom leading to the boys' toilets.  The learning support teacher, whose post — rated as 0.9 — is almost full-time, is accommodated in a room that the school built from its own resources approximately ten years ago.  The room is also used as a computer room, office, storage room, secretary's room and staff room.  A rural co-ordinator was recently sanctioned for the school under the DEIS programme and a special needs assistant must be accommodated.  Where are all these members of staff to be accommodated?</p>
            <p eId="para_797">The school has one sink and there is no room to install more.  There are no sinks in the classrooms and no running water, hot or cold.  One computer is squeezed into a corner, allowing limited access for teachers and pupils, and the limited space severely restricts reading, art, computer work, dancing, circle time and the display of the children's work.  Physical education is completely dependent on weather conditions.  The staff room has no kitchen facilities, no hot or cold water and no food preparation or disposal area, yet it caters for a minimum of eight people.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">This year the school participated in the school meals programme, organised by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Participation is curtailed somewhat due to the lack of the most basic resources.  The school wishes to operate a breakfast club in addition to participating in this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">The school serves an area with a high incidence of educational disadvantage, which is furthered by the lack of adequate and basic facilities, which are clearly required.  The provision of a general purpose room is essential to the school and it would serve as a dining room for use under the school meals programme.  Children could eat their lunches, produce shows, sing, talk, hold exhibitions and do art there while staff could use it for supervision.  Since the classrooms are small and overcrowded, ventilation problems arise, especially if the children are contained there all day.  Such containment leads to stress among the pupils and teachers and gives rise to health and safety concerns for everybody.  Small communal toilets for large numbers of children leave a lot to be desired.  It is clear there is an urgent need to upgrade and disperse them so the requirements of everyone do not need to be catered for in just one location.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">The school authorities were given to understand that the necessary capital funding would be provided some months ago.  The Minister can therefore imagine their disappointment and dismay not only over the refusal of their initial application, but also over the binning of their appeal.  I believed they might have been mistaken in their understanding of the matter until I read the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled on 2 October 2007.  It stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_801">On 5 March 2007, I announced details of the schools to receive funding under the Small Schools Scheme 2007.  The application from the school to which the Deputy refers was successful and officials from School Building Section have been in contact the school authority advising them of the next steps in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">The Minister made reference to Saint Bríde's national school but there is no such school in Ballynacargy, nor is there in Emper or the next village.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">Will the Minister reinclude Ballynacargy national school if its application has been rejected and ensure it receives the money necessary to put in place two new classrooms, the general purpose room, a staff room, two resource rooms and an office?  This would allow the conversion of the existing four classrooms into two rooms.  I rarely raise any such matter in the House but this is very important.  I refer to my own area, which is expanding and designated by the Department as disadvantaged.  Will the Minister please find the €484,000 that the board of management, principal and staff and parents were originally led to believe they would receive?  Later they were led to believe the contrary and then, on the basis of the reply to my parliamentary question, they were lead to believe they had the funding again.  I am afraid the Minister will disappoint me again.  A legitimate expectation has been raised on foot of her reply and it is up to her to correct the misinterpretation, if there is one.  On behalf of the people associated with the school, I ask that a wrong be put right.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_230" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_804">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  His main interest concerns the school to which he referred.  I understand there are two schools listed for Ballynacargy, each with its own roll number.  One is Scoil Bhríde and the other is Ballynacargy mixed national school.  My reply to the parliamentary question last week related to Scoil Bhríde and my reply tonight concerns the mixed national school.  If there is any confusion over this, I will be happy to clarify it for the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">The Deputy will be aware of the extent of the modernisation of schools nationwide, particularly given the under-investment in this area over many years.  Obviously, many old schools are being modernised and we have been keeping pace with the rapid population growth.  This year alone the Government has spent €550 million on the schools building programme.  Under the lifetime of the national development plan, some €4.5 billion will be invested.  This is an unprecedented level of investment and shows our commitment to continued investment in primary and post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">Some €300 million will be invested in large-scale building projects, mainly in rapidly developing areas.  This will facilitate 150 large-scale projects and deliver 15,000 additional permanent places in new schools and extensions and modernised facilities in existing schools, benefiting over 45,000 pupils.  It will also enable the purchase of sites to facilitate the smooth delivery of the schools building programme, again focusing on site requirements in rapidly developing areas.  The balance will be used to fund the other schemes referred to by the Deputy, namely, the summer works scheme, the small schools scheme, the permanent accommodation scheme, etc.  This year alone, some 1,500 schools building projects will be delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">As Deputy Penrose rightly stated, Ballynacargy mixed national school has a principal, three mainstream teachers, one learning support-resource teacher and one resource teacher.  There are small classes and a pupil teacher ratio of approximately 1:19.  Enrolment has been very stable over the past five years.  I accept that in some cases additional teachers were employed before accommodation was made available.  It was more important to put staff in place than wait for the classrooms, particularly in respect of resource teaching and supports for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">The mixed national school's application was not successful on this occasion.  I will clarify the position in respect of the other roll number referred to by the Deputy.  It is open to the school to apply again for funding and the circumstances outlined by the Deputy will be taken into consideration in light of the multi-annual schools building and modernisation programme.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_809">I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue with the Minister for Education and Science.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House tonight.  I have raised many matters on the Adjournment since I was first elected to the House, but this is the first time the Minister responsible has come here to respond to me.  I appreciate the Minister's presence to listen to what I have to say about the gaelscoil in Clonmel.  I know she has a great deal of knowledge of this saga, which I would prefer not to have to raise in this Chamber.  I have asked many questions about it in the past, but on this occasion I will not be satisfied with answers which will not be carried through to fruition.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">I would like to outline briefly the history of this affair.  When South Tipperary County Council announced in 1997 that it was planning to stop using some office accommodation in the Irishtown district of Clonmel, it was suggested that the local gaelscoil, which had nowhere to go, be allowed to use the building.  At the time, a divided council decided, against the wishes of the council management and engineers, to give the school permission to use it.  As the building was not fit to be used as office accommodation, the county manager had recommended that it be levelled and the site used as a machinery yard.  The members of the council did not take that recommendation on board, however — they agreed to the request of the parents and board of management in the school that the building be used to accommodate the gaelscoil.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">The school authorities have been looking for permanent accommodation since 1997.  When by-elections were held in the Tipperary South constituency in 2000 and 2001, public meetings were held in the local hotel and promises were made that a site would be acquired.  The then Minister for Education and Science announced before the 2002 general election that a site would be made available to the gaelscoil — proof of this promise exists in the form of photographs which were taken with local representatives on the occasion of the announcement.  When a further public meeting was held in 2007, Fianna Fáil councillors decided that they would table motions at local authority level favouring a site at the Ballingarrane estate, which is the property of the local council.  They knew that the site would not be made available by the council, however.  The management of this hugely successful school, which is supported by everybody in the local community, has been dealt with in a disgraceful and unfair manner.  The parents, board of management and students are frustrated because they have been waiting for a long time for a new site, which is needed because the conditions in the current accommodation are extremely bad.  They were hoodwinked in the past when various possible sites were mentioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, to take this issue in hand by deciding where the school should be built.  There are two possible sites, the Ballingarrane site I mentioned and a site on health board land, both of which are owned by the State.  The latter site is owned by the Minister for Health and Children, under the auspices of the Health Service Executive.  I ask the Minister to bang together the heads of the officials in the various Departments so that one of these two sites can be selected and a new school can be built.  I understand that the necessary funds have been allocated and progress could be made if a site was made available in the morning.  The manner in which this saga has been allowed to continue is unfair to those involved in the gaelscoil and the community as a whole.  It is particularly unfair that the staff and students of the school should have to work in unsuitable conditions.  I appreciate that the Minister has met various delegations about this matter, but she needs to bang some heads together so that a site can be identified and the new school can be built.</p>

            <p eId="para_813">I thank Deputy Tom Hayes for giving me an opportunity to outline the current position maidir le Gaelscoil Chluain Meala.  Tuigim go maith an gá atá ann le haghaidh scoil nua.  I genuinely appreciate that the school has had to wait a long time for new accommodation.  The Government will do all it can to acquire a site for the gaelscoil as soon as possible.  The aggressive protest that took place during the election campaign earlier this year, which was mentioned by Deputy Hayes, will not affect my determination to do something about the need for a new school.  Children were used in an inappropriate manner during the protest, which took place in Clonmel.  While I recognise that there is a need for a new school, I do not believe any school should operate in the manner observed that day.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">As the Deputy is aware, the property management section of the Office of Public Works, which generally purchases sites for new schools on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, was asked to identify potential sites for the gaelscoil.  A number of responses were received after the OPW placed an advertisement seeking proposals for possible sites.  Six sites were visited and their technical suitability as locations for the gaelscoil was considered.  The preferred location for the new school development emerged as a three-acre site on the existing Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute campus, which is owned by Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute Limited.  The institute proposed to the Department that its campus in Clonmel be relocated to a large-scale technology park.  The relocation proposal was approved on certain conditions, one of which was that the institute should assist the Department in finding a site for the gaelscoil.  As I said earlier this year, while this process is reasonably well advanced, it is taking longer than expected.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">Given the urgency of the school's needs, the Department has started to seek alternative site options.  The Department is committed to acquiring a site for the school as quickly as possible, regardless of whether the site is part of the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute campus or at a location elsewhere in Clonmel.  All sites are being considered as part of the efforts which are being made to bring this process to a conclusion.  I thank Deputy Hayes and reassure him go bhfuilimid ag déanamh ár gcuid ar son Gaelscoil Chluain Meala chun suíomh ceart a fháil.</p>

            <p eId="para_843">The detection and prevention of drug related crime is, of course, a matter for all members of An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">Uniform and plain-clothes personnel, including the District Detective and Drug Units, as well as Community Policing and Mountain Bike Units supplemented as required by Divisional Traffic Corps personnel, conduct regular patrols in the areas referred to by the Deputy to prevent and detect criminal activity including that related to drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">Ongoing liaison is also maintained with the Garda National Drugs Unit in respect of persons suspected of being involved in the illegal importation and/or distribution of drugs.  The Deputy will be aware that resources such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also deployed extensively in dealing with drug crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the allocation of additional resources in the areas referred to by the Deputy remains under constant review by local senior Garda management who also continuously monitor District and Divisional crime trends.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">As the Deputy will appreciate, policing operations and the deployment of Garda resources are matters for the Garda Commissioner. It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel within the Garda organisation on a priority basis in accordance with overall policing requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">The assignment of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed.  Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.  This takes place against the background of the unprecedented expansion of An Garda Síochána which has taken and will continue to take place increasing the overall strength of the Gardaí to 16,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">Finally I can assure the Deputy that the enforcement of the law relating to drugs very much continues to be a key element in the Government's policing priorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_907">I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that he is satisfied with the level of training provided for members of An Garda Síochána who are authorised to carry firearms.  It compares favourably with similar training provided internationally by other Police Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">Firearms Authorisation Card Holders, who are designated personnel permitted to carry firearms in An Garda Síochána, are required to attend for firearms refresher training at least three times per calendar year.  Two of the refresher training courses are for ‘live fire' and one course takes place on the recently acquired Firearms Automated Training  System (FATS).</p>
            <p eId="para_909">An Garda Síochána has two full-time Firearms Training Units, based at Garda Headquarters and the Garda College.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">Significant developments in An Garda Síochána Firearms Training over the last 18 months have included:</p>
            <p eId="para_911">The purchase of three FATS units took place in January 2006.  FATS refresher training commenced immediately thereafter and has since proved to be a very successful development.  FATS facilitates judgmental training by posing armed scenarios on screen which the Firearms Authorisation Card Holders must contend with in a real time situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">The FATS facility allows playback where the Firearms Authorisation Card Holders can then evaluate their actions and decisions with Firearms Training Instructors.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">FATS training has allowed development of judgmental firearm training as well as traditional marksmanship training.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">Two Prefabricated Modular Firearms ranges have been ordered by An Garda Síochána and delivery and installation is expected before the year end.  One range will be located at the former disused range at the Garda College and the second at a new site in Airton Road, Tallaght.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">These Prefabricated Modular Firearms ranges are newly designed products recently brought to the market that will facilitate live fire shooting for up to four persons in a carefully contained environment which adheres to all range safety requirements.  The delivery of the two prefabricated Modular Firearms ranges will reduce An Garda Síochána dependency on using army ranges and furthermore will provide access to firearms ranges at all times without causing noise pollution to neighbouring areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">Garda Firearms training is constantly reviewed to ensure that sufficient training is provided and that training compares favourably with international best practice.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_918">I welcome the third report of the Garda Inspectorate entitled, "Policing in Ireland — Looking Forward".  It is a comprehensive examination of administration and operation of the Garda Síochána and I would like to record my gratitude to the Chief Inspector Kathleen O'Toole and her colleagues Bob Olson and Gwen Boniface for their work.  As the members of the House know, the Garda Síochána has been undergoing a programme of quite fundamental change in recent years.  Many of the changes were brought about by the Garda Síochána Acts 2005 to 2007 and these involved fundamental structural changes such as the establishment of the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the Inspectorate; the transfer of responsibility to the Commissioner for matters such as expenditure and the employment of civilians; and the specification in statute of the role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in setting the broad strategic direction of the Force.  Now that the legislative environment has been reshaped, the focus for the programme of change and modernisation is moving to the internal administration and operation of the Garda Síochána.  This is where the Garda Inspectorate has a key role in ensuring that the resources of the Garda Síochána are used as efficiently and effectively as possible.  It is my role as Minister and that of my Department to support the Garda Síochána in achieving that goal of continued efficient and effective policing.  The Inspectorate in its report has made a number of recommendations covering  a broad range of issues ranging from the devolution of greater autonomy to regional Assistant Commissioners to the need to review recruit training.  The Inspectorate has not suggested deadlines for the implementation of all its recommendations and understandably so.  Some of the recommendations are already being implemented while others such as a review of recruit training will require further work on the part of the Inspectorate in the first instance.  I expect to see early implementation of the Inspectorate's recommendations and my Department with the assistance of the Inspectorate will monitor their implementation.</p>

I am also advised that external email is also available to Sergeants, Gardaí and civilian staff as operational needs require.  A total of 1,066 external email addresses are currently being utilised by Gardaí and civilian staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that a pilot project to facilitate email communications between An Garda Síochána and members of the public using mailboxes assigned to individual sections and stations is currently underway.  The pilot will assess the various factors that need to be addressed with regard to greater use of external email by An Garda Síochána, including the type and volume of Garda business that can be transacted using email, the potential uses for Section and Station emails and the security and resource implications for the Garda network.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">Following the pilot project external email facilities will be rolled out on a phased basis to all stations in the DMR and  to District HQ stations and other stations outside the DMR where the necessary network infrastructure is in place. The roll-out will also include making external email facilities available for all members of Sergeant rank of whom there are over 2,100 in active service.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_942">I am informed by the Garda authorities that engagement with the rural community and rural policing is one of the priorities of An Garda Síochána.  Senior Garda management continually monitor resources and policing initiatives to ensure that the service being provided is continuously improving and the recent comments by the Inspectorate in this regard will be taken on board.  Rural Policing is continually being reviewed and developed and the enhanced liaison structures between Garda Management and Local Authorities through Joint Policing Committees and Community Policing Fora will be of enormous benefit to the policing of rural areas when these are fully up and running.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">There are now Detective Inspectors appointed in each Division with specific responsibility for the investigation of serious crime in rural areas.  The quality of criminal intelligence becoming available to An Garda Síochána is continually being improved and it was as a result of such intelligence that a Cork-based gang targeting the elderly in rural areas of Cork and Limerick was identified early this year and a number of suspected members of the group are currently before the Courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">In order to enhance rural policing a number of initiatives have been implemented in Garda Divisions nationally.  Checkpoints are held at strategic locations in rural villages in order to detect criminals travelling to commit crime outside the areas where they live and to prevent the commission of crimes and offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">Crime Prevention Officers are available to offer crime prevention and security advice to residential and business groups and regularly provide such advice through local media outlets, newspaper and radio broadcasts.  In addition, residents in rural areas are encouraged to establish and rejuvenate Community Alert Schemes assisted by members of local Community Policing Units.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">Staffing levels at Garda stations are monitored by local Garda management to ensure that adequate coverage is provided and where vacancies arise within the rural community they are filled as expeditiously as possible to ensure continuity in the service being provided by An Garda Síochána to the local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">Initiatives under Operation ‘Anvil' have been implemented in every Garda District in the country incorporating special crime prevention/ detection patrols in rural areas which have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to crime.  Such patrols include all available Garda resources including uniform and plain-clothes personnel, District Detective and Drug Units as well as Divisional Crime Task Forces and Traffic Corps personnel.  Patrol times are also varied in order to maximise coverage in such areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">In conjunction with Muintir na Tire, I will launch the Community Alert Strategy document for 2007-2011 on the 26 October 2007.  This new strategy will inform how best Community Alert can be implemented over the next five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">An internal Garda working group has been established to develop a comprehensive model of Community Policing.  This model is being informed by an extensive public consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed by Garda management.  The purpose of such monitoring is to ensure that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_960">I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 126 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">The Criminal Assets Bureau has been at the forefront of the fight against organised crime, including drug trafficking, in this jurisdiction since its inception in 1996.  The significant successes that the Bureau continues to achieve by its operations demonstrates the effectiveness of its approach in pursuing illegally gotten gains.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">The manner in which the Bureau operates has, in the eleven-year period of its existence, come to be viewed, both domestically and internationally, as a very successful model for targeting persons seeking to derive profits from criminal activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">The Bureau keeps the allocation of personnel under constant review in light of its workload and where there is a requirement, additional resources are allocated to the Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">The staff of the Bureau will be augmented as required.  For example, two additional financial crime analysts posts have been recently sanctioned and recruitment is under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">Furthermore two additional members of staff from the Revenue Commissioners will also be shortly assigned to the Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">In relation to the issue of the Bureau's work at local levels, I can inform the Deputy that in order to maximise the benefit that can be derived from local knowledge, officers from the Criminal Assets Bureau work closely with gardaí from specific regions and localities in order to ensure that the efforts of the Bureau are targeted in the most effective manner possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">In particular, profilers trained by CAB are now in place in each Garda Division and the number of profilers in particular Divisions is being increased.  This will enable drug dealers at whatever level in communities to be pursued.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">In this context, I have previously advised this House that I intend to include in the Government's policing priorities for An Garda Síochána a specific reference to enhanced liaison arrangements between Garda Divisions and the Criminal Assets Bureau in the pursuit of those engaged in drug dealing at all levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">The use of local Garda officers in this way ensures that preparatory groundwork can be carried out in advance of a full investigation by the Bureau.  Asset profilers have at all times recourse to the expertise and advice of the Bureau.  Essentially a key function of these profilers is to ascertain and build up information at local levels and point out individuals at whom the Bureau's work can be targeted.  Such information is then investigated and followed up further by CAB.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">I can assure the House that any individuals in local communities who believe they can openly flaunt wealth or assets secured through illegal activities, including drug dealing, will be vigorously pursued by the Gardaí either through the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 or through the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau under its statutory remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">Finally, I can assure the House that whatever resources are required by CAB will continue to be provided by the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_993">I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 136 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">The current status of the Thornton Hall Prison project is as follows.  Negotiations are currently underway with a preferred bidder, who was selected following an EU public tender procedure in relation to the construction and maintenance of the prison complex at the Thornton Hall site.  It is intended that these facilities will provide a modern and cost effective replacement for the prison complex currently located at the Mountjoy Complex which, as is widely acknowledged, is in urgent need of replacement.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">The contract under negotiation is a Public Private Partnership model which will include the construction of the required prison facilities along with the ancillary infrastructure including services etc.  The relevant planning procedure for this development is set out in Part 4 of the Prisons Act, 2007 and in this regard it is planned to publish the necessary notices etc. including details of the proposed development along with a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment within the next month or so.  The procedures for public consultation regarding the proposed development are set out in the Act and as can be seen, these afford all interested parties ample opportunity to make their views known and have them fully considered prior to a decision to proceed with the development.  It is intended, subject to the statutory planning phase and the successful conclusion of the contract negotiations, to commence construction next spring and to begin operation of the new facilities in early 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">A section of the Thornton Hall site has been set aside as a location for a replacement for the Central Mental Hospital.  That project, including the relevant planning requirements, is being dealt with by the Department for Health and Children and it will have no bearing on the timing of the prison project.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">It is not, for commercial and procurement reasons, possible to provide details as to the likely costs of the project. The disclosure of such information is, in any event, not allowed under Department of Finance PPP procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">I can however confirm the following expenditure which has taken place to date on the project.  The cost of the site acquisition was €29,900,000.  An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired to provide a dedicated access road to the main site.  This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to the effect of increased traffic generated by the prison project.  In addition to allaying these concerns, the new roadway will provide significant additional benefits both during the construction and operational phases of the project.  The cost of this additional land was €1,305,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">A total of €4,808,475 has been expended to date on preliminary site works including surveys, landscaping, security and maintenance of the property, studies such as archaeological, topographical, etc., and professional fees including legal and specialist technical advice.</p>

            <p eId="para_1001">Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003. I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">Every effort is made in the licensing process and otherwise to ensure that all licensed firearm holders are conscious of their obligations in relation to the safe storage of their firearm.  To this end all firearm certificates are accompanied by recommendations and advice in relation to the safe storage and security of firearms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">The Criminal Justice Act, 2006 provides for increased fines and penalties for firearm offences.  A person found in possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances or with criminal intent is liable to imprisonment for up to 14 years with a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">I recently established a Firearms Consultative Panel to assist with the introduction of a new firearms licensing system which is provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, 2006.  The Panel will comprise representatives of the various shooting interest groups, relevant Government Departments and An Garda Síochána.  I will make details of the panel and its terms of reference known in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1008">I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 142 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">The stated objective of the European Union is to develop a comprehensive migration policy which covers both legal and illegal migration.  The Deputy will find a statement of the Commission's current priorities in combating illegal immigration of third-country nationals in Commission document COM (2006) 402.  The Communication addresses nine priority areas and proposes a number of practical and action focused measures. These priorities are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">Co-operation with third countries;</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">Secure Borders — Integrated management of external borders;</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">Fight against human trafficking;</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">Secure travel and ID documents;</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">Addressing regularisations (the discretionary decision to grant a legal stay on the territory);</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">Tackling a key pull factor: illegal employment;</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">Return policy;</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">Improving exchange of information through existing channels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">Carriers liability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">These measures are intended to build upon the Hague programme which contains a special emphasis on immigration and asylum and which sets out a five-year programme for closer co-operation in Justice and Home Affairs at EU level from 2005 to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">In December 2005, the European Council adopted the EU Action Plan on best practices, standards and procedures for combatting and preventing trafficking in human beings. The Action Plan is divided under a number of headings:</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">Co-ordination of EU Action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">Scoping the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">Preventing trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">Reducing demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">Investigating and prosecuting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">Protecting and supporting victims.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">Returns and reintegration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">External relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">Under the heading of preventing trafficking, the EU Action Plan has three specific objectives:</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">Addressing the root causes of trafficking;</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">Raising awareness of the dangers involved in trafficking and publicising successful prosecutions to deter traffickers;</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">Enabling early identification of victims to prevent exploitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">There are a number of actions currently being taken by the EU under the Action Plan.  A network of contact points in Member States is being established.  The first EU Anti-Trafficking Day will take place on 18 October 2007 and both An Garda Síochána and officials of my Department will participate in a Seminar organised by the European Commission on that day examining what steps should be taken next at European level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">The Portuguese Presidency are currently holding a conference in Porto on human trafficking and gender specific issues.  The European Commission has prioritised trafficking in human beings prevention projects for funding under the "Prevention of and fight against crime" programme for 2007.  These are just some of the actions taking place this year, at EU level, as it would not be possible, by way of parliamentary question, to mention all of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">The Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings was adopted by the committee of Ministers on 3 May 2005 and opened for signature in Warsaw on 16 May 2005.  The Convention is regarded widely as a comprehensive Treaty that effectively focuses on the protection of victims and the safeguarding of their rights.  In 2006, the Council of Europe launched a campaign "Human Beings — Not for Sale" to raise awareness about the issue of human trafficking and to promote the widest possible accession to the convention.  My officials and An Garda Síochána have actively participated in the campaign and Ireland signed the Convention in April 2007.  Developing a timetable for ratification of the Convention will be an early priority for this Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">My Department will continue to participate in all relevant EU, UN and Council of Europe fora on human trafficking and both my officials and An Garda Síochána will continue to work on a bilateral basis with other governments on both operational and policy development issues.  My Department is also participating in the UN Global Initiative to fight human trafficking which is a two year programme launched by the UN earlier this year with the support of the United Arab Emirates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">I am informed by the Garda Authorities that Liaison at an international level between the Garda Síochána and the European / international law enforcement community is part of the approach to the issue of human trafficking taken by An Garda Síochána. Representatives of An Garda Síochána, at senior management level, regularly participate at both European and international meetings to facilitate the exchange of information and best practice between EU Member States in particular, and on a more global basis, with countries of origin of suspected victims of human trafficking, including meetings hosted by Europol, Interpol and Frontex.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">Members of An Garda Síochána have attended courses held at CEPOL — European Police College, relating to the subject of "Trafficking in Human Beings", which are targeted at senior police officers who are responsible for prosecution services, countering trafficking cases or organized crime cases, members of lecturing staff in police training and development units, heads of police forces or government officials at Ministerial level, who deal with questions of human trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">As part of the EU AGIS programme the GNIB held a conference in Dublin in November 2005 titled: "Forum to Improve Best Practice in the Prevention, Detection, &amp; Investigation of Trafficking in Human Beings and Examine Best Practice in Fighting and preventing Corruption of Public Figures in the Administration of Immigration Regulations." The conference was funded by the European Commission (Directorate General Justice and Home Affairs) and the Department of Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform and was attended by representatives from a number of other EU Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">Earlier this month, Operation Pentameter II was launched in London.  This is a coordinated campaign of police activity to tackle the trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation within Ireland and the UK.  An Garda Síochána and Department officials are working with their British counterparts to ensure that the whole common travel area becomes a hostile environment for those who intend to engage in this nefarious crime.  I hope to be in a position to announce further international co-operation on a wider European scale in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">In addition, legislation providing for the criminalisation of trafficking in persons for the purpose of exploitation is expected to be published in the very near future.  This legislation will criminalise trafficking in human beings as provided for in EU Council Framework Decision on combating trafficking in persons.  The criminal law provisions in other international instruments, including the Council of Europe Convention on action against trafficking in human beings, are also being taken into account in the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">I can also inform the Deputy that it is my intention to make further announcements in relation to the issue of human trafficking later this week.</p>

            <p eId="para_1044">On 30th June 2007 (the latest date for which Community Policing figures are readily available), the total personnel strength of An Garda Síochána was 13,361.  The total personnel strength attached to Community Policing at that time was 565.  This represents a percentage of 4.22% of the total strength of the Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">Of course community policing involves more than a single unit within An Garda Síochána.  All Gardaí have a role to play in addressing community policing issues.  I agree with the view of the Garda Inspectorate, expressed in its most recent report, that community policing is a fundamental policing philosophy and that there is a strong foundation of it in Ireland.  I welcome the review of community policing currently underway in the Garda Síochána and I look forward to its outcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_1049">The interim and final reports of the Advisory Group on Garda Management and Leadership Development contain many excellent recommendations on how management of the force can be further improved.  I am very grateful to Dr. Maurice Hayes and the other members of the group for bringing their expertise from business, academic and public administration circles to bear on the issues of leadership in policing.  Significant progress has been made on the issues raised in the reports.  A civilian Chief Administrative Officer at Deputy Commissioner level has already been appointed and a civilian Director of Communications will shortly be in place.  A number of other senior civilian posts in human resources, information and communications technology, finance, change management and legal affairs will be filled in the near future.  Since December 2006 approval has been given for the recruitment of 600 civilian staff of whom over 300 have been assigned already, releasing Gardaí for operational duties.  The Garda Information Services Centre at Castlebar, Co. Mayo now eliminates the need for Gardaí to return to their stations to report incidents thereby freeing up more Gardaí for operational duties.  It has a staff of over 180 civilians who input data on the PULSE system, freeing up significant amounts of Garda time for continued operational duty.  I will fully support the Garda Commissioner in the continued implementation of organisational reform which is supported by the analysis and recommendations of the Hayes Group.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1053">I can inform the Deputy that in 1998 the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. John O'Donoghue, T.D., following a Government decision, set up an expert group to examine the Probation Service under the chairmanship of Mr. Brian McCarthy.  This group produced its first report in November 1998.  The final report of the Group was published in May 1999 and made several recommendations.  Many of the recommendations of the Expert Group report have been implemented by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">A further Review of the Probation Service was undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2002, the Review entitled "Comptroller and Auditor General Report on Value for Money Examination of the Probation Service" was published in 2004.   Following the publication of the Report a small working group involving Departmental and Probation officials was set up to build on existing work including the Expert Group Report and the Value for Money audit of the Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">In September, 2005, following an open competition, a new Director was appointed to the Probation Service.  To support the Director and strengthen the management of the Service, a new senior management structure for the Service has been put in place comprising three Deputy Directors and 2 Assistant Deputy Directors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">The Probation Service Strategy Statement and Work Plan of Strategic Actions 2006-2007, set out the strategic goals of the Service for the period which include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">Creating new management structures;</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">Carrying out an administrative review of the Service and making appropriate organisational and resourcing changes as required;</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">Developing a strategic plan for the Young Person's Probation; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">Maximising the potential benefit of Community Service to local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">In keeping with the objectives of the Strategy Statement:</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">An administrative review of the Service commenced in March, 2007 and, I am advised that this is now nearing completion. The main focus of this review is to look at the administrative structure of the Service nationally.  The findings of that report will inform decisions regarding any administrative change deemed necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">A dedicated Young Persons Probation Division (YPP) was recently established within the Probation Service which has responsibility for the full implementation of the sections of the Children Act, 2001 relating to the Probation Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">An external consultant was also recently appointed to conduct a review of the Community Service Scheme.  I expect the finding of that Review to be presented to me by mid 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">In addition to the foregoing, I can also advise the Deputy that a Review of the Systems of Internal Financial Control in the Probation Service was completed in June, 2007.  This Report made a recommendation, inter alia, on the establishment of a dedicated financial management unit within the Probation Service.  All recommendations of that Report are currently being implemented and a professional accountant will be appointed very shortly to head up the Financial Management Unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that on foot of a Government Decision dated 18 April, 2007, approving a "Juvenile Justice and Child Protection Package", provided for 71 additional professional and administrative posts for the Probation Service.  The recruitment of these additional staff  is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">I am confident that the Probation Service has benefited from the aforementioned comprehensive reviews and it now has the necessary resources to carry out its work in an effective and efficient manner under the guidance of its senior management team.</p>

            <p eId="para_1070">I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 450 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">I am informed by the Garda authorities that 202 behaviour warnings have issued to adults up to 31 August, 2007 and 59 behaviour warnings issued to children in the same period.  There was one good behaviour contract issued to a child in this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">No anti-social behaviour orders have been issued by the courts up to 31 August, 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">Some inaccurate conclusions have been drawn from the fact no ASBOs have yet been applied for by the Garda authorities.  The regime involves a series of procedures including behaviour warnings and, in the case of children, good behaviour contracts.  In setting up the regime, the intention was that these warnings or good behaviour contracts would themselves address the problem behaviour.  It is only if they fail that an ASBO will be applied.  In any case, it inevitably takes time to reach the stage where an ASBO itself might be sought.  Where these do not succeed in altering a person's behaviour, they will culminate in ASBOs being sought by the Garda authorities from the courts.</p>

        <b>Deputy Damien English</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         his views on the concept of allowing the Director of Public Prosecutions or the prosecutor make oral submissions during a court sentencing hearing; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [22558/07]

          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_260">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1076">The Deputy will be aware that the Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to make submissions at the sentencing stage in criminal cases.  In considering how to proceed with this issue, we are fortunate to have the Report of the Review Group on the Balance in the Criminal Law, which was chaired by Dr Gerard Hogan, SC and which was published in March this year.  The question of prosecution submissions was one of the topics considered by the Review Group.  At the outset of its considerations, the Group noted the perceived anomaly which arises in the context of the existing right of the prosecution to apply for a review of sentence which the Director of Public Prosecutions believes to be unduly lenient, on foot of section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993.  In essence, in reviewing an unduly lenient sentence the prosecuting counsel are called upon at an appeal under section 2 to make a submission in order to influence the sentencing decision.  It might appear to some that there is a contradiction in allowing such submissions at the appeal stage but not at the original sentencing stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">However, this issue is not quite as clear cut as one might think.  As the Review Group highlighted in its report, it is incorrect to suggest that under the current regime prosecution counsel have only a limited role in the sentencing decision of the court.  At present there is a restriction on delivering an actual sentencing submission to the court.  However, prosecuting counsel have ample opportunities to present evidence to the court during the course of the trial that would constitute an aggravating factor in the sentencing decision.  Conversely, prosecuting counsel may also challenge evidence presented by the defence side regarding mitigating factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">Indeed the Director of Public Prosecutions' most recent Guidelines for Prosecutors (June 2006) states that prosecuting counsel have a duty to ensure that the court has before it all available evidence relevant to sentencing, all submissions concerning the impact on the victim in accordance with the provisions of section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 and all relevant evidence relating to the accused's background, circumstances and previous convictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">The Review Group examined five options on the role of the prosecutor in the sentencing decision of the court.  These options are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">1.A purely declaratory provision which restates the current position, permitting the prosecutor to adduce and challenge evidence at the sentencing stage and to give information to the court regarding sentencing precedents at the request of the court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">2.A slightly more expanded version of option 1 which would allow the prosecutor to also volunteer information regarding sentencing precedents whether this was requested by the court or not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">3.The prosecutor would be permitted to volunteer previous precedents and to make submissions to the court as to the aggravating factors, but without advocating a particular sentence or range of sentences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">4.The prosecutor would advocate a range of sentences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">5.This envisages a completely permissive regime whereby the prosecutor would be allowed to advocate a particular sentence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">Option 1 reflects the position as stated in the DPP's Guidelines for Prosecutors while Option 5 represents the other end of the spectrum whereby prosecuting counsel would advocate a defined sentence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">The Review Group favoured option 2, to allow the prosecutor to volunteer information regarding sentencing precedents whether requested or not by the court.  The Group also recommended that option 3 be kept under review by my Department in consultation with the DPP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">Reflecting the complexity of the issues involved, the Group stressed the need for the availability of greater information regarding sentencing.  To this end, the report expressed support for the developments being carried out by the Irish Sentencing Information System project under the chairmanship of Ms Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court.  The Group was also clearly of the view that there would be some benefit from the Court of Criminal Appeal or the Supreme Court developing guideline judgements, where a number of appeals concerning the same offence would be heard together and a general guideline judgement given, indicating the approximate median on the scale of severity and the factors that might influence an upward or downward adjustment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1088">The issue of sentencing submissions by prosecuting counsel is complex and will require further careful consideration and consultation by me in advance of any legislative action.</p>

        <b>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         if he will take steps or raise the matter with the Garda Commissioner in an effort to ensure that the resources available to national and local drugs units are doubled, in particular, in view of the UN reported 34% increase in opium production in Afghanistan in 2007 and the resulting increase in heroin flowing into the market here and the head of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction’s further confirmation that more Europeans are using cocaine.

          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_261">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1090">As the Deputy points, out the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime Annual Drug Report 2007 identifies that the level of heroin production in Afghanistan significantly increased in 2006 and that the consumption of cocaine grew in Europe last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">The Government views with concern such global developments and any potential rise in the level of any illegal drugs being trafficked into this country. The drugs situation is dynamic and ever changing and we must ensure that our policies are flexible to meet those changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">I assure the Deputy that An Garda Síochána will continue to direct its drug law enforcement activities in a focused way through intelligence driven operations at national, regional, divisional and district level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">Underpinning this approach, An Garda Síochána will continue to invoke a number of broad strategic responses in addressing the issue. These include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which supply and distribute illegal drugs within this State;</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">conducting intelligence driven operations focusing on all aspects of the illicit drugs trade including commodity, logistics, distribution and financing;</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drugs trade; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce both the supply and demand for drugs within society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">The Garda National Drugs Unit co-ordinates large scale operations against drug dealing-trafficking and unit personnel either investigate such cases themselves or assist local investigation teams.  Additional assistance is also available from other specialised Garda support units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau. A joint Garda National Drugs Unit-Criminal Assets Bureau initiative is in place which targets local dealers. Furthermore, the detection and prevention of drug related crime is, of course, a matter for all members of An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">Significant drug seizures, including the considerable amounts of heroin and cocaine continuing to be seized in recent times, have been made as a result of these operations. The operations, which are ongoing, continue to dismantle drug trafficking networks and have led to the arrest in recent times of major criminals both based here and abroad who are involved in the drugs trade.and such measures will continue to be vigorously pursued by An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">With regard to resources, the extent of resources both in financial and personnel terms, which continues to be made available to An Garda Síochána is proof of the Government's commitment and determination to ensure that the Garda authorities will continue to implement targeted, intelligence and high intensity operations against organised crime with a special focus on drugs crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">As the Deputy will appreciate, policing operations and the deployment of Garda resources are matters for the Garda Commissioner. It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel within the Garda organisation on a priority basis in accordance with overall policing requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">The assignment of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. This takes place against the background of the unprecedented expansion of An Garda Síochána which has taken and will continue to take place increasing the overall strength of the Garda to 16,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">I assure the Deputy that additional Garda resources are coming on stream all the time. These additional human resources will facilitate the Garda Commissioner in the allocation of additional manpower to areas most in need, including areas with a significant drug problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">In conjunction with this, the Government are ensuring that our law enforcement agencies continue to have a strong legislative platform from which to operate in their work in tackling those involved in such criminal activity. While we already have a strong legislative package in place for tackling drug trafficking, the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 provides for further measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of drug offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">Undoubtedly, drug misuse remains one of the most complex social ills faced globally. Our drug law enforcement response is a vital feature of our overall response in addressing the issue but we cannot just look at the issue from a supply reduction perspective only.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">Rather, we must examine the drugs problem in the wider context in which it takes place and take cognisance of the fact that the demand for and the use of illegal drugs is what fuels the drugs trade. The measures that we have in place to address the problem must take account of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">The Government remains resolutely committed to tackling the problem through our National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The national strategy addresses the problem under pillar headings of education and prevention, supply reduction, treatment and rehabilitation and research and is firmly founded on the principle that drug misuse needs to be addressed in an integrated manner across these headings through a co-operative approach involving the statutory, community and voluntary treatment sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under the stewardship of my colleague and Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, is the lead Government Department in co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy.  My Department's remit in this area, while not exclusively, is primarily in the area of drug supply reduction, and drug law enforcement remains a key feature of the Government's drug policy framework. Finally, I assure the Deputy that the Government is very clear that there is no room for complacency in our response to the issue of drug misuse. Under my own area of remit, I would stress again that the enforcement of the law relating to drugs continues to be a key element in the Government's policing priorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_1110">The person in question was arrested around midday on 2 June 2005 in relation to the theft of a motor vehicle and taken to Store Street Garda Station, Dublin.  He was found hanging in his cell later that afternoon. He was removed to hospital where he died a little more than three months later.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">A Detective Superintendent from outside the relevant Garda Division was appointed immediately after the incident to carry out a detailed investigation into all the circumstances surrounding the deceased person's arrest, detention and removal to hospital.  A file in the matter was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who issued instructions that no prosecution should ensue. On 13 July of this year an inquest into the death returned a verdict of suicide.  The deceased person's family were represented at the Inquest and financial assistance was offered to them by my Department in relation to their associated legal costs. Most recently the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission have informed me that they have decided in the public interest to carry out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death as provided for in section 102(4) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">The capacity for independent investigation in the public interest of such tragic deaths was a key objective in the establishment of the Ombudsman Commission and I believe that the Commission must now be left to carry out its independent investigation as speedily and thoroughly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">Finally, I should also mention that a civil action has been initiated by the deceased person's family and this is currently being dealt with by the Garda Síochána in conjunction with my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1121">In recognition of the cross-cutting nature of many of the issues identified by the Law Reform Commission in its Paper, a high-level interdepartmental committee has been established to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to the problems arising in this area. A key task of this committee will be to identify the legislative and administrative actions to be taken in response to definitive recommendations for legislative reforms which, following a lengthy consultation process, will be set out in the Law Reform Commission's forthcoming Report on Multi-Unit Developments and to determine a timescale for their implementation. I expect that this Report will be published later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1123">The Irish Prison Service continues to work to implement the commitments contained in its Drugs Policy &amp; Strategy, entitled Keeping Drugs Out of Prisons, which was launched last year.  Working to fulfil these commitments involves the implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons while, at the same time, continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting prisoners' treatment and rehabilitative needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">Drug rehabilitation programmes for prisoners involve a significant multidimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and visiting statutory and non-statutory organisations.  Measures to reduce the demand for drugs within the prison system include education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders.  These programmes and interventions are delivered on an individual and co-ordinated basis by the Prison Healthcare Teams, Psychology Service, Probation Service, Prison Education Service and prison officers.   Particular initiatives put in place include Drug Free Areas, Drug Misuse Awareness Programmes, Support Programmes and appropriate health interventions, Substitution Therapies, Vaccination Programmes and treatment for viral illnesses.  In addition, the Irish Prison Service provides prisoners with a range of opportunities to encourage them to aspire to a substance-free lifestyle, before and after release, thereby reducing demand for illicit substances.  An important aim of the new Policy &amp; Strategy is the operation of all treatment programmes within a coherent policy framework, understood and supported by all agencies involved in drug treatment within the prison system, with the ultimate aim being to provide access to drug treatment and rehabilitation programmes for all prisoners who wish to avail of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">The Policy and Strategy outlines the range of treatment services that the Irish Prison Service seeks to make available throughout the prisons estates; these are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">Assessment and Throughcare Planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">Information, education and awareness programmes, etc.</p>

            <p eId="para_1132">Supported Voluntary Drug Testing Units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">Motivational interventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">Extended treatment options will be provided in specific sites based on assessed risk or needs of the prison population there.  These will include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">Evidence informed programmes regarding drug misuse and offending behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">Cognitive Behavioural Treatment programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">12 Step programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">Appropriate peer support programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">In line with community provision many of these services are already available in prisons situated in the Dublin region but are not available in prisons situated outside of the Dublin region.  Initial focus in enhancing the range and quality of treatment services available has been on those prisons which are assessed as having the greatest client need; this has involved the recruitment of nurses, a psychologist focusing on addictions and prison officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">The most significant development has been the awarding of a contract for the provision of addiction counselling services for all prisons in the country to Merchants Quay Ireland, a leading drug treatment provider.  This contract is currently being rolled out, and all prisoners wherever they may be imprisoned will have access to addiction counselling services by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">Finally, in relation to the success of treatment services, in line with evidence from community treatment services there is clear evidence that where treatment structures are adequately and appropriately resourced, drug use, particularly unsafe use involving injection, decreases.  Reports from within the prisons would confirm that the advent and development of substitution based programmes within the prison system has significantly decreased illicit drug use.  Any resources devoted to drug treatment are far outweighed by the various personal (lower health risk, improved family and social function, etc.) and community (reduced street crime associated with drug use, lower incidence of potentially costly communicable diseases) benefits arising.  In view of the particular difficulties associated with the prisoner population (e.g. social exclusion and isolation, multiple social and health problems, long histories of polysubstance abuse, etc.) the resources applied in prisons should garner a disproportionate health and social benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">The Probation Service, in partnership with the IPS and other agencies, provides a range of individual and group programmes in prisons to address rehabilitation and resettlement issues including those related to drug misuse.  The Department through the Probation Service also provide funding to a number of Community-based Organisations which enter prisons to support and motivate prisoners in addressing their substance misuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">The main drug rehabilitation programme, which has been in operation since 1996, is operated in Mountjoy Prison complex.  That programme includes drug awareness and methadone support modules.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">Eleven programmes have been facilitated in the Mountjoy complex since the beginning of 2006.  Of the 99 prisoners who participated in these programmes, 43 graduated (completed successfully) and 4 remain on the current programme.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1146">At its meeting on 12-13 June, 2007 the Council of the European Union reached an agreement on a general approach on a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States. Discussions are ongoing with a view to formal adoption of the Framework Decision as soon as possible. This agreement follows the adoption in 2005 by the Council of a Decision on the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record, which supplements the relevant provisions of the Council of Europe 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">On 27 November, 2006 a Memorandum of Understanding on information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK relating to sex offenders was signed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">The MOU was negotiated between my Department and the Home Office, with input from the Northern Ireland Office. It relates to information about persons travelling between Ireland and the UK and who are subject to sex offender notification requirements in their own jurisdiction. This covers sex offenders travelling between any of the legal jurisdictions in these islands. The rationale for the Memorandum is that such information will be shared between police forces for the purposes of protecting the public from the risks presented by sex offenders — whether paedophile or otherwise — and investigating serious sexual offences. The transmission of any information necessary to achieve these purposes is covered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">As a result of the MOU, the exchange of such information between the Garda Síochána and British police forces, which of course has already been taking place for some time, is now being put on a formal footing. The information will now be shared as a matter of course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">This Memorandum of Understanding is another example of the close relationship between Ireland and the UK and in particular between the two parts of this island. It is also the most recent example of the benefits which accrue to both sides through co-operation and co-ordination in the areas of criminal justice and law enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">As the MOU provides, its use and effectiveness will be kept under review, and I am confident that full use will be made of its potential by the police forces of all our jurisdictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">A Registered Sex Offender Advisory Group has been established consisting of representatives of An Garda Síochána, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Northern Ireland Office. As part of its work, this Group evaluates the potential for sharing information, examining the registration criteria in both jurisdictions for sex offenders and identifying areas for further co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153">Persons who have been convicted of sex offences abroad who, at the time of the conviction or thereafter, become resident for the qualifying period in this jurisdiction are subject to the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001, where there is comparability between the offence to which the foreign conviction applies and offences covered by the Act. It is not necessary for the offence or the conviction to occur after the coming into force of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Investigation Unit of An Garda Síochána monitor and manage the notification provisions as they apply to those subject to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">The provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 are kept under constant review by my Department with a view to ensuring the Act is operating in an efficient and effective manner.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1233">The reprehensible gun attack on Garda Paul Sherlock last week was a stark reminder of the dangers facing members of the Garda Síochána as they go about their daily task of protecting us all.  An extensive investigation team has been assembled comprising Gardaí attached to the DMR North Central Garda Division and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, supported by members from Crime and Security Section, Garda Headquarters. This investigation is progressing and a number of arrests have been made in the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda Síochána in combating serious crime and in particular murder.  Operation Anvil continues to provide successes in this area.  Figures which I received from the Garda Commissioner recently show that from its beginning in May 2005 to 9 September last, 768 firearms have been recovered, 37,437 searches for drugs have taken place and over 70,000 checkpoints established.  These figures make clear the unrelenting nature of the activity being undertaken by the Garda Síochána to deal with these crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">In addition the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation has been strengthened to 70 persons and is tasked with targeting organised criminals and disrupting criminal networks by providing armed assistance during planned operations and searches against those persons suspected of being involved in organised criminal activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">A package of crime investigation initiatives was recently launched by senior Garda management.  These include the establishment of a crime training faculty at the Garda College, Templemore to provide a professional, comprehensive training programme for those charged with the management of serious crime investigations.  Senior Investigating Officers will also be appointed.  These will be key personnel who will take charge of serious crime investigations.  Incident Room Co-ordinators will manage serious crime investigation incident rooms, and specialist victim interviewers will interview persons under 14 years of age or with special needs who are victims of sexual crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">Additional Divisional Detective Inspectors will be appointed and will be allocated on the basis one per District in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and one per Division outside the DMR.  Regional Detective Superintendents will be responsible for the investigation of serious crime were also announced.  Pre-screening and competency based interviewing have been commenced as part of the selection process for Detective Gardaí and Sergeants.  This will enhance best practice and procedures in the investigation of serious crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">A Major Investigation Management System will also be developed to provide a PULSE based management system for all serious investigations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">As a result of the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 the Garda Síochána are in a much better position to ensure that those involved in gun crime will be made accountable for their actions.  The Act intensifies further the fight against gangland activity by:</p>
            <p eId="para_1240">making it more difficult to get bail in drug trafficking, firearms and other serious cases;</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1248">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Siochana Complaints Board Annual Report for the year 2006 has been considered by the Garda Commissioner and his senior management team and its recommendations will inform policy in the relevant areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">The Deputy raises two separate issues one of which relates to an alleged lack of action on the part of the Commissioner in relation to possible minor breaches of the Garda discipline regulations brought to his attention under the procedures set out in section 7(4)of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act 1986.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">I am informed by the Garda Authorities that on receipt of a referral under section 7(4) the Commissioner considers himself legally obliged to cause a review of the investigation to be undertaken including affording the member concerned an opportunity to make further submissions — whether or not submissions had been made to the Complaints Board as part of its investigation.  At the end of the process the Commissioner makes a final determination on whether there has been a breach of discipline.  Where such a breach has occurred it is dealt with by way of advice, admonition or warning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">Of 63 such cases referred to the Commissioner in 2006 disciplinary action was taken in 35 cases, in 20 cases the Commissioner decided that no breach of discipline had occurred and 8 cases were outstanding at the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">The second issue raised by the Complaints Board relates to an alleged inability on the part of members of the Garda Síochána to apologise for mistakes.  Where the incident is of a minor nature there is provision under the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act 1986 (and indeed analogous provisions of the Garda Síochána Act 2005) for informal resolution.  This avenue can be availed of to resolve disputes in some instances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">However it is worth noting that the Morris Tribunal expressed the view that Garda disciplinary procedures which operated prior to 1 June of this year were characterised by an "overlay of legal formalism". The new Garda disciplinary regulations will address that issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">More generally, I accept of course that apologies should be made where appropriate, but equally the Garda Síochána as an organisation must be guided in such matters by its legal advisers.  Apologies can be made provided such an apology does not affect future legal proceedings.  Where such proceedings are taken an apology or statement of regret can affect the extent to which the State is liable in any possible settlement of the case, and this must be taken into account.</p>

            <p eId="para_1262">I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 154 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">I welcome the third report of the Garda Inspectorate entitled, "Policing in Ireland — Looking Forward".  It is a comprehensive examination of administration and operation of the Garda Síochána and I would like to record my gratitude to the Chief Inspector Kathleen O'Toole and her colleagues Bob Olson and Gwen Boniface for their work.  As the members of the House know the Garda Síochána has been undergoing a programme of quite fundamental change in recent years.  Many of the changes were brought about by the Garda Síochána Acts 2005 to 2007 and these involved fundamental structural changes such as the establishment of the Garda Ombudsman Commission and the Inspectorate; the transfer of responsibility to the Commissioner for matters such as expenditure and the employment of civilians; and the specification in statute of the role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in setting the broad strategic direction of the Force.  Now that the legislative environment has been reshaped, the focus for the programme of change and modernisation is moving to the internal administration and operation of the Garda Síochána.  This is where the Garda Inspectorate has a key role in ensuring that the resources of the Garda Síochána are used as efficiently and effectively as possible.  It is my role as Minister and that of my Department to support the Garda Síochána in achieving that goal of continued efficient and effective policing.  The Inspectorate in its report has made a number of recommendations covering a broad range of issues ranging from the devolution of greater autonomy to regional Assistant Commissioners to the need to review recruit training.  The Inspectorate has not suggested deadlines for the implementation of all its recommendations and understandably so. Some of the recommendations are already being implemented while others such as a review of recruit training will require further work on the part of the Inspectorate in the first instance.  I expect to see early implementation of the Inspectorate's recommendations and my Department with the assistance of the Inspectorate will monitor their implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">The remit of the Inspectorate under the Garda Síochána Acts 2005 to 2007 is to ensure that the resources available to An Garda Síochána are used so as to achieve and maintain the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness both in its operation and administration when compared against the best practices and standards of comparable police forces. As regards the Garda transport fleet the Inspectorate has called for a more strategic approach to transport policy to ensure that it meets the business needs of the Force.  The Inspectorate has said it will bring forward proposals to benchmark Garda transport to determine a fleet size and composition that will best support policing needs and optimise visibility in the community.  I look forward to receiving those proposals.  As the Inspectorate has acknowledged the Garda fleet is undergoing a major investment programme and an expansion in specific areas which will target organised crime, public order and traffic in particular.  The total spend for 2006 on the purchase of 1,378 new vehicles to upgrade the fleet was €27.45 million (resulting in the renewal of over half of the entire fleet).  Further investment is taking place this year (including the purchase of additional motorbikes which will make a significant contribution to traffic law enforcement).</p>

An applicant for legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation for him/herself. The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.

            <p eId="para_1300">As the Deputy will appreciate, it is the Customs Service of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners which has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs at importation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">The Customs Service has particular responsibility for implementing import controls at points of entry to the State, including airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">I have been informed by the Customs authorities that in 2007, the Revenue Commissioners completed an extensive review of customs controls at all licensed aerodromes including Knock.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">Following on the review and with increased  flights from EU and non-EU countries into Knock, the level of customs control has been increased and has been applied on a risk-analysis basis.  This is based on analysis and evaluation of general seizure trends, traffic frequency, route and similar risk indicators.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">These controls have included over sixty visits to Ireland West Airport, Knock since the start of 2007 by a drugs detector dog team based in Sligo.  Extra staff have also been assigned to the area which will further assist in increasing drugs detection at the airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">Attendance by staff is selective and targeted and covers the full range of flight times and these are kept under constant review to take particular account of emerging smuggling trends and any traffic increase at the airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">In relation to Garda strategies for dealing with drug offences, such strategies are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs.  These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs, conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered and working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies within and outside the jurisdiction to address the national as well as international aspects of drug trafficking and distribution.  These strategies continue to result in operational successes as evidenced by the ongoing levels of drugs seized by the Garda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">The trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs at local, national and international level is constantly monitored by the Garda.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_279">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1310">Operation Pentameter II was launched in London by the UK Home Secretary on 3 October 2007.   Officials from my Department and senior Garda officers have been participating in planning meetings since earlier this year and it is intended that An Garda Síochána will run complementary enforcement operations in this jurisdiction at the same time as the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">The operation which is led by Gloucestershire Constabulary is a proactive and co-ordinated campaign of activity to tackle the trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation throughout the common travel area of Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">The sharing of intelligence between police in both jurisdictions is occurring on a regular basis, and co-operation in investigating suspected cases of human trafficking which impact on both the UK and Ireland is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">Through Operation Pentameter, a significant level of co-operation has developed, particularly in the area of training, with input from the UK authorities into training courses run by staff from the Garda Training College.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">A senior officer at Detective Superintendent rank from An Garda Síochána has been appointed as a liaison officer with Operation Pentameter and he continues to meet with his counterparts in the UK on a regular basis with a view to ensuring that co-ordination of activity between the two jurisdictions in tackling human trafficking is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">Furthermore, a member of the Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI) is also currently seconded to the Garda National Immigration Bureau in relation to this issue and this will maximise the co-operation between An Garda Síochána and the PSNI with regard to the problem of human trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">Operation Pentameter II is linked to a larger initiative on human trafficking being undertaken in a number of European countries including Ireland and this larger initiative will be launched in Brussels soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">The operation is currently in an intelligence-gathering phase.  It is my intention that the Criminal Law Bill, which I will publish shortly, will be enacted in time for the enforcement phase of the operation.  It would be inappropriate to give any further information that might jeopardise what is now a live policing operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">While there is no evidence of a substantial human trafficking problem in Ireland, the Government is determined that all necessary actions are taken to ensure that it does not become a significant problem in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">Finally, as part of Operation Pentameter 1, a poster campaign was launched in both Ireland and the UK to encourage victims of human trafficking to report their plight to State authorities.  The undertaking of additional awareness raising initiatives in both the UK and Ireland during Operation Pentameter II has been discussed and plans are being formulated in this regard.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1321">An Garda Síochána, as part of its contribution to the Europol Organised Crime Report which was refined to become the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA), undertakes an annual assessment of organised crime in Ireland.  The most recent assessment was completed in November 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">The analysis carried out for this report concludes that the nature of organised crime gangs continues to be the same as in previous years. There are two categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">The first category consists of individuals/groups that are well established and tightly structured involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences. The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">Because of the relative fluid nature of those involved in serious/organised crime in Ireland it is not possible to easily place them in a particular group.  While it is difficult therefore to provide an accurate and definitive number for the various groups operating here, gangs operating in this jurisdiction are targeted on an ongoing basis and profiles regarding the personnel of such groups are continually updated. Their membership, operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are likewise proactively targeted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">Intelligence-led operations, primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda Síochána, under the remit of the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, and the Organised Crime Unit are regularly undertaken, targeting those suspected of being involved in organised crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1326">The Criminal Assets Bureau, under the Assistant Commissioner, National Support Services, works closely with other national units and senior investigating officers in all Garda Divisions to ensure, wherever possible, that assets derived from criminal activity, including drug-related crime, are subject to post-conviction confiscation, pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act 1993, civil restraint pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996-2005 and the relevant Revenue and Social Welfare legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">An Garda Síochána will continue to use intelligence-led operations against selected targets to combat the criminal activities of these groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_1328">In relation to the resources available to the Gardai, the Deputy will be aware that An Garda Síochána has never been better resourced than it is now. The personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána as on 31 August 2007, was 13,288.</p>
            <p eId="para_1329">As the Deputy will also know, there is an unprecedented expansion of An Garda Síochána currently taking place which is increasing the overall strength of the Gardaí to 16,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1330">The Garda budget now stands at €1.44 billion; this compares to just over €0.9 billion five years ago.  Garda overtime this year will total about €140 million; this compares to €66 million five years ago.  The Garda fleet is undergoing major modernisation.  Last year €24.7 million was used to purchase 1,378 vehicles for the Force, renewing over half the entire fleet.</p>
            <p eId="para_1331">The National Development Plan provides €260 million over the next five years for Garda stations and other accommodation.  This level of resources translates into tangible improvements with increased and improved levels of policing on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">Finally, I repeat the assurance that I gave to the House last week during the lengthy debate on crime that it is my intention to continue to prioritise areas such as gun crime, organised crime and drugs, and public order.</p>

The proposal in question is subject to Title IV of the Treaty, the application of which to Ireland is subject to the provisions of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">It is not correct to say that Ireland has decided to "opt-out" of this proposed Directive. Under the Protocol Ireland has three months from the date a proposal is presented to Council to notify our intention to take part in the adoption and the application of such a measure. Ireland may also accept a measure any time after it has been adopted.     While Ireland did not within the initial 3 months exercise its option  the matter remains open.</p>
            <p eId="para_1336">Ireland continues to participate actively in the current discussions on the proposal at European level and my Department, in conjunction with other relevant Departments, is currently examining the issues raised by the proposal.    The question of Ireland's participation in this measure will be determined following adoption of the Directive and Ireland's participation would require Oireachtas approval at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">Ireland exercises its option to participate in Title IV measures to the maximum extent compatible with the maintenance of the Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom. Any proposals arising under Title IV are considered on their own merits.</p>

        [22491/07]

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_289">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1370">The position is that section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars to be affixed to containers in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off licensed premises which are adequate to enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">However, while the labelling of containers in which alcohol is sold with a view to combating under-age consumption is an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome in order to render it effective in practice. These challenges arise under two headings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">Firstly, practical difficulties will be encountered at retail level where several individual containers are packaged together for sale, e.g. an enclosed six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a nailed wooden box containing bottles of wine. This raises the important issue of whether the label should be attached earlier in the supply or distribution chains rather than at the point of sale.  Attaching labels to the containers at an early stage might be simpler but it would create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors and lead in turn to increased  distribution costs.  Moreover, in the case of imports from EU countries, such additional labelling requirements could be regarded as infringing internal market rules relating to free movement of goods.  Also, it would be naive to overlook the possibility of labels being removed, or rendered non-legible, after sale.  The possible transfer of the alcohol from a labelled container to another unmarked container cannot be ruled out either.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">Secondly, from an enforcement perspective it is clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container will not in itself constitute proof that the alcohol in the container has been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appear on the container.  It may have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith before being passed on to the underage person.  Indeed, a labelled container may have passed through several hands before finding its way into the hands of an underage person.</p>
            <p eId="para_1374">Issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container were raised during consultations on implementation of section 22 of the 2003 Act and the matter was subsequently raised with the Office of the Attorney General.  That Office has expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of possession of a labelled container and doubt is, therefore, cast on the utility of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">One option that could possibly be considered in the context of future legislation would be a presumption that any alcohol container found in the possession of an under-age person had been purchased by that person from the licensee identified on the container until the contrary was proved.  However, the Attorney General's Office has also advised that such a proposal would raise serious constitutional issues and would run the significant risk of being found to be inconsistent with Article 38 of the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">For these reasons, I do not intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act at this time.  I will, however, give serious consideration in the context of future legislation to any reasonable and workable proposal that would deal with this matter without giving rise to the difficulties that I have outlined.</p>

            <p eId="para_1384">In the first instance, the figure of 10,000 requests for access to telecommunications traffic and location data made by the Garda Síochána in 2006, as claimed by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, is a self-described ‘estimate' and not a factual description.  In this regard, it is not the practice and it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose the details of data access requests, including their number or the types of offences to which they relate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">The retention of and access to such data are governed by the provisions of Part 7 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  Part 7 provides that access requests to telecommunications service providers may only be made for the purposes of:</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of crime; or</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">the safeguarding of the security of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">The Garda Síochána makes such requests only where these conditions apply and only after they have been filtered by senior Garda officers; not all requests by investigating Gardaí result in requests to the telecommunications service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">I categorically reject any suggestion that these provisions are being or have been used to improperly intrude upon the privacy of any person, innocent or otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">Part 7 of the 2005 Act also introduced — for the first time — robust accountability arrangements and counter-balancing safeguards to protect personal data.  These arrangements include a statutory complaints procedure overseen by a Judge of the Circuit Court, as well as a statutory oversight procedure overseen by a ‘designated judge', who must be a serving Judge of the High Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1391">The designated judge's first annual report into the operation of Part 7, dated 20 March, 2007, as laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, found ‘that the provisions of the legislation are being maintained and in particular that the provisions of the Act of 2005 are not being used for routine Garda inquiries and investigations'.</p>

            <p eId="para_1401">The restorative justice process seeks to address the fall-out from criminal behaviour by making the offenders more directly accountable for their actions and by giving a greater voice to victims of crime. This is an issue I have prioritised since taking up office and I await the Commission's deliberations with interest.</p>

         his views on concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the continued high level of sick leave in the Prison Service; the steps being taken to deal with this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [22507/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_300">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1421">The Deputy will be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General, whilst outlining his concerns about the level of sick leave in the Prison Service over the period 2002 -2006, has acknowledged that the figures provided by the Prison Service for January to April 2007 show an overall reduction of 10% in per capita sick leave days and that this would represent the first major reversal of the trend of recent years, if maintained.  The most recent figures available to end of July 2007 show a reduction of 15.8%  in per capita sick leave days compared with the same period last year confirming the downward trend.  This is a very welcome development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">The Comptroller and Auditor General's report also acknowledged that any examination of sick leave, or indeed any other aspect of the management of the Prison Service over the period in question, must be seen in the context of the particular circumstances within which the Service was operating during the period under review.  The period 2002-2006 was a time of major change with the negotiation and implementation of new working arrangements to replace overtime, and decentralisation of the Prison Service's headquarters initially to Clondalkin and later to Longford. These major organisational changes, which have been successfully rolled out, impacted on the capacity of the Prison Service to address the sick leave problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">It must be borne in mind also that central to the new working arrangements negotiated with staff representatives is a unique system, based on the concept of annualised hours, which is designed to encourage smart working and to reduce absenteeism. The indications are that the new working arrangements, combined with other measures, are contributing to the downward trend in sick leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">Alongside the introduction of the new working arrangements, a determined effort continues to be made to reduce sick leave through a range of initiatives and all of those efforts are reflected in the significant improvement in the level of sick leave in the first seven months of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">Work is ongoing in relation to improving the management of sick leave in a consistent manner across all prisons and reflecting best practice in this area.  Governors are encouraged to pursue a policy of early intervention and to hold return to work interviews that ensure that the appropriate steps are taken whether through support or sanction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">As regards support, prison staff have access to psychological services. There is also support available for Officers through the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP).  In support of the EAP, a Chief Welfare Officer was appointed in April, 2007 and two Employee Welfare Officers will also be available to support and advise staff with difficulties arising inside or outside the workplace which may have an impact on their ability to provide regular effective service.  The principal providers of the EAP services are a network of Staff Support Officers. Most  prisons have Staff Support Officers and where there are vacancies these will be filled shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">The Prison Service is also committed to promoting a positive working environment which will assist in reducing absenteeism. One such initiative is the introduction in March, 2007 of a formal anti Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying Policy for the Prison Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">The Prison Service is also exploring with the Department of Finance and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer the possibility of establishing an Occupational Health facility dedicated to the particular occupational needs of prison staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">Where sanction is appropriate, Officers are issued with warnings about their level of absences and if there is no significant improvement in their attendance level a number of measures are available, including the withdrawal of payment for sick leave or even dismissal where there is persistent absenteeism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">Whilst the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General did highlight concerns about the period 2002-2006, I am encouraged by the fact that there is a marked improvement in the level of sick leave in this current year.  It is my view that with the support and cooperation of management and staff, the new working arrangements and initiatives outlined will continue to produce positive results for sick leave levels across the Prison Service.</p>

         the steps being taken to reduce the supply of cocaine to Ireland in view of its increased usage and the recent report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime which suggested that cocaine use is increasing at a higher rate in Ireland than in any other developed countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1432">The Government is well aware of the increased prevalence of cocaine usage in Ireland in recent times and as the Deputy points out the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime Annual Drug Report 2007 identifies that the consumption of cocaine grew in Europe including in Ireland last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">Of course the Government views with concern such global developments and any potential rise in the level of any illegal drugs being trafficked into this country. The drugs situation is dynamic and ever changing and we must ensure that our policies are flexible to meet those changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">Since 2000 there has been a noticeable increase in both the number of seizures and the quantity of cocaine seized by the Garda authorities as demonstrated by the table below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">The precise availability and usage of cocaine in this country is difficult to determine with any degree of certainty, due to the hidden nature of all illegal drug usage including cocaine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">A joint research report on cocaine use by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) and the National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST), was also recently published which identified the increased prevalence of cocaine usage in recent times in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">The Interdepartmental Drugs Group, chaired by my colleague Minister of State Pat Carey T.D., is currently liaising with the relevant Departments and Agencies in relation to the recommendations contained in the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">Efforts to tackle the problem are broadly based to include measures aimed at both supply and demand reduction, including awareness initiatives. The new National Drug Awareness campaign which is currently being finalised under the remit of the HSE will be particularly concerned with, inter alia, dispelling any perceptions of cocaine as a safe recreational drug.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">This increasing use of cocaine is, of course, a matter of concern and the Garda authorities have taken a number of measures to address the problem on the supply reduction side.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">The Garda National Drugs Unit and local drugs units conduct intelligence-driven operations to target individuals suspected of involvement in the distribution of cocaine. Drug units and community policing personnel are engaged in intelligence gathering on individuals and groups suspected of involvement in the sale and distribution of the drug. There is also targeted patrolling by uniform and plain-clothes personnel of problem areas in order to detect and disrupt persons involved in such activity.  The continuing high level of cocaine seizures by the Gardaí demonstrates the operational success of these strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">Finally, Ireland is one of the participants of the recently established Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre (Narcotics) MAOC(N) in Lisbon, which has the specific objective of intercepting narcotic shipments, in particular cocaine, to the European Union from Latin America.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">As well as having officers assigned to Interpol and Europol, An Garda Síochána also has Liaison Officers posted in London, The Hague, Paris and Madrid whose primary function is to liaise with the authorities in those and adjoining jurisdictions on drugs and other criminal matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">I can assure the Deputy that An Garda Síochána will continue to direct its drug law enforcement activities in a focused way  through intelligence driven operations at national, regional, divisional and district level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1480">I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 and 197 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">As the Deputy will appreciate, the question of how offenders might best compensate their victims is not a straightforward one.  The Courts may on occasion make orders requiring that compensation be paid to a victim and a civil action for damages can also in principle be taken.  The reality, however, is that it will rarely be straightforward to obtain financial redress in this fashion.  It is in large part for this reason that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme exists.  The Compensation Tribunal is in a position to provide compensation to victims of violent crime and has a budget of €4.388 million in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">The Programme for Government contains a number of commitments in respect of advancing compensation arrangements for victims and it is my intention to pursue these undertakings following further study over the course of my term of office.  These steps will be taken against the backdrop of a range of complementary measures to improve supports for the victims of crime.  I should also mention that the National Commission for Restorative Justice, established earlier this year to consider the application of the concept of restorative justice in the Irish Criminal Justice System, is due to submit an interim report in the coming months and a final report in 2008.  Its findings will also of course be of relevance in considering how best to deal with the aftermath of an offence.</p>

         the steps that have been taken by his Department to reduce the incidence of human trafficking through Irish ports in view of recent revelations which highlighted the absence of appropriate legislation here to tackle human trafficking; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [22534/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_305">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1491">An Garda Síochána has put in place a number of initiatives designed to prevent and detect a range of criminal activity, including human trafficking, at the frontiers of the State.  Robust immigration controls have been adopted at ports of entry to the State, two of which, Operations ‘Gull' and ‘Sonnett', were commenced to target criminality which has a cross-border dimension.  Both operations have uncovered suspected cases of trafficking of persons and smuggling of illegal immigrants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">Ireland participates in the activities of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX).  Among the objectives of such activity, is the disruption of the flow of trafficked persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">The Garda National Immigration Bureau Information System (GNIB IS) provides access to databases of information which have the capacity to identify persons who have a criminal intent as they attempt to enter the State.  Access to an Interpol database of stolen/forged travel documents has resulted in the detection of persons in possession of stolen passports and who are suspected of involvement in trafficking and/or smuggling of people into the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">The Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) has appointed a number of Airline Liaison Officers (ALOs) who are deployed as appropriately to airports in EU Member States that have been identified as convenient departure points for travel to Ireland and which are suspected of being utilised by criminals involved in the smuggling of immigrants and trafficking of human beings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1495">The provisions of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000 are enforced by Immigration Officers operating at ports of entry.  The following cases are recent examples of this enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1496">On 26 July 2007, at Dublin Circuit Court, a person was convicted of twelve (12) counts of trafficking of illegal immigrants contrary to the provisions of section 2 of the Act involving the arrival of twelve Mauritian nationals in the State, through Dublin Airport.  A four year custodial sentence was imposed in that case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497">On 30 August 2007, at Dublin District Court, an Egyptian national was also convicted of a breach of the provisions of section 2 of the Act and had a twelve month term of imprisonment imposed on him, in a case involving the arrival of six Egyptian nationals in the State, through Dublin Airport.  The sentence was suspended following the Judge being satisfied that his departure from the State to Egypt had been confirmed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">Operation ‘Pentameter 2' which is being launched with the UK Authorities continues to recognise the vulnerability of the Common Travel Area (CTA) to abuse by persons engaged in illegal immigration and is targeting those suspected of involvement in the trafficking of human beings, as well as liaising with those persons directly affected by this type of criminality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">I can assure the Deputy that the Government is not complacent on the issue of human trafficking  into Ireland or into other jurisdictions via Ireland.  Legislation creating an offence of recruiting, transporting, transferring to another person, harbouring or knowingly arranging or facilitating the entry into, travel within or departure from the State of a person for the specific purpose of the trafficked person's sexual or labour exploitation or removal of his or her organs will be published shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">In addition, it is intended that the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will, subject to enactment, provide the necessary framework for addressing the immigration aspects of trafficking so as to comply with the relevant protection provisions in the Council of Europe Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">In particular, in the context of the treatment of victims, it is intended that a framework will be put in place whereby a victim of trafficking can be afforded an immediate period of recovery and reflection in the State and also, in circumstances where he or she wishes to participate in any criminal proceedings in the matter, a further period of residence to enable him or her to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">The legislation will be the first in a series of measures to be rolled out over the next year and I intend to make a further public announcement in relation to the issue of human trafficking later on this week.</p>

            <p eId="para_1504">I wish to advise the House that the report in question relates to an inquiry by Mr Michael Mellett into the circumstances surrounding the tragic death of Mr Gary Douch while in custody in Mountjoy Prison. The report was submitted to my predecessor in March, 2007 and was carried out in a totally independent manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">As with the case of all deaths in custody, the Garda Síochána were called to Mountjoy Prison and initiated a criminal investigation into the death of Gary Douch.  A file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and as a result an individual has been charged with causing the death of Gary Douch.  The progressing of those criminal proceedings is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the judicial arm of the State.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no role in those proceedings but does have a duty not to do anything or reveal any information that might prejudice those criminal proceedings.  Although it was the original intention to publish the report of Mr Mellett, the strong advice from the Attorney General was to the effect that the report should not be published.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">In general terms I can say that Mr Mellett in his report identified a number of systems failures within the prisons system which may have contributed to the death of Mr Douch. The findings of the Report have serious implications for the future management of our prisons and the Government took the view that a full statutory Commission of Investigation was required to address the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">Following the passing of resolutions in both Houses of the Oireachtas and the making of a Government Order, my predecessor appointed Ms Gráinne McMorrow, Senior Counsel, as the sole member of a Commission of Investigation into the death of Mr Douch. The report of a commission of investigation must, pursuant to section 38 of the Commission of Investigations Act 2004, be published as soon as possible after it has been received unless a court directs otherwise.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1509">Latest data show a very significant decrease in the gender pay gap in Ireland in recent years with a gap of 11 per cent in 2004 and 9 per cent in 2005. These figures compare favourably with a gender pay gap of 22 per cent in Ireland only five years earlier and indicate that steady progress is being made towards the abolition of the gender pay gap.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">However, as these are new data series, gathered by Eurostat as part of its annual review of social indicators, they are subject to ongoing quality review and must therefore be treated with some caution at this stage. In addition, the Eurostat calculations exclude part time workers who work fewer than 15 hours per week, a group more likely to comprise lower paid women workers and as a result, the data may be distorted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">Despite these reservations, it is considered that the introduction of the National Minimum Wage would probably have impacted very positively on women's earning capacity and on the narrowing of the gender pay gap.  Prior to the introduction of the minimum wage, women were traditionally more likely to receive very low wages, particularly if they were working in the sectors which were predominantly female.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">While the narrowing of the gender pay gap cannot be attributed solely to the introduction of the National Minimum Wage, the narrowing is noteworthy. Other positive influences on the narrowing of the gender pay gap include an improvement in maternity leave provision and a much-increased provision of childcare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">However, as the gender pay gap shows, women still earn less than men on average and there are variations in the pay of male and female employees in many economic sectors. It is widely considered that the single biggest factor behind the gender pay gap is the time which women take out of the labour force for child bearing and caring but there are a number of other factors. These include occupational segregation, educational and training differences, promotion policies within firms, availability of childcare, availability of maternity and parental leave and of family-friendly work practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">Addressing the gender pay gap continues to require a multi-faceted approach across a number of areas. The recently published National Women's Strategy 2007-2016 has put in place a suite of key actions designed to reduce the gender pay gap which will be delivered on a cross departmental basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">In tandem with these specific actions there are a number of other actions across the Strategy which encompass the broad spectrum of women's lives in relation to socio economic opportunity, the wellbeing of women and engaging women as equal and active citizens which will also contribute to the reduction of the gender pay gap in the coming years.  No single survey has been carried out by my Department or its agencies on the subject of the gender pay gap.</p>

            <p eId="para_1517">The latest figures available from the Central Statistics Office, which now has responsibility for compiling crime statistics, cover the 12 month period ending 30 June 2007.  They show a drop in headline crime of just over 1% on the previous 12 months. The number of murders and cases of manslaughter have remained stable, with an increase of two in the number of murders and an increase of one in the number of manslaughter cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1518">I was pleased to note that the detections of persons in possession of drugs for sale or supply increased by 29% in the year and 25% in the quarter.  While these detections add to the crime figures, they reflect vigorous enforcement by An Garda Síochána, including through Operation Anvil.  I  was also pleased to note the decrease in the high volume crimes of theft by 1.2%, burglary by 12.5 % and robbery by 7.3%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">The 12.5% decrease in traffic fatalities can be attributed to the continuing high levels of road traffic law enforcement by the Garda Síochána, particularly the use of mandatory alcohol testing, which commenced in July of last year and has made a significant contribution to this decrease.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">Garda figures show a detection rate of 40% for 2006 which compares favourably with rates internationally and with rates here of 36% in 2003 and 35% in 2004 and 2005.  The crime rates must, of course, be seen against the background of the rises taking place in population.  The crime rate per 1,000 of population dropped from 26 in 2003 to 24.5 in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">While the figures are encouraging, I am not suggesting that these crime rates are acceptable.  It is right that we acknowledge the achievements of the Garda Síochána and the other criminal justice agencies, which week in, week out bring individuals to justice for their crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">I have discussed these figures with the Garda Commissioner, particularly the increase of 3.2% in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter last year. He has advised me that the Garda authorities are undertaking a number of specific targeted operations directed against particular types of crime in areas where increases have taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1523">In relation to anti-social behaviour, I have the power under the Garda Síochána Act to set policing priorities for the Garda Síochána.  I am in the course of determining these priorities for 2008.  One of the areas I intend to prioritise is the combating, particularly in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, of the problems of public disorder with particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities especially through utilization of the legal mechanisms being made available viz. ASBOs and behaviour warnings and closure orders.</p>

        <b>Deputy Seán Barrett</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         if he will postpone further development of the COSC Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence to address the serious concerns of the Irish Violence against Women non-governmental sector in relation to COSC’s limited remit; if it is proposed to address all forms of violence against women in an integrated and cohesive way, focusing on the three key elements of protection, provision and prevention, as required by the 1995 UN Beijing Platform for Action; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1529">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 212 and 213 of Thursday, 28 June 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">Cosc — The National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence was established on 25 June 2007.  I am aware that some concern was expressed about the remit of the newly established Cosc office.  I would like to reiterate that as announced on 18 April, 2007 and on several occasions since that date, the remit of the office very emphatically includes violence against women.  The wider remit of the office covers (i) domestic and sexual violence against women, (ii) domestic and sexual violence against men and (iii) elder abuse.  The State/Non-governmental structures already in place to deal with violence against women will continue and will be strongly supported by the new office.  Prior to the establishment of the Cosc, responsibility for this area within my Department was assigned to Divisions with a wide number of other responsibilities.  The appointment of the Executive Director to Cosc, raises the profile and the focus on this work within my Department.  Responsibility for this area was further dispersed across a number of Government Departments and agencies.  For the first time there is now in prospect a dedicated, resourced office at Government level, with the key responsibility to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated "whole of Government" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">Cosc is to collaborate closely with the service providers who support victims and treat perpetrators. It has already begun work to achieve its tasks, which are: to work with Government Departments, Agencies and Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in the sector to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated service to support victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; to develop and deliver awareness raising strategies to ensure that victims are aware of the availability of services in their locality and that society is made aware of the extent and impact of behaviours and crimes of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; to develop strategies to address the issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in line with best international practice; to further develop standards for service delivery and for training programmes which address domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; to put in place strategically based positive actions which work with perpetrators of domestic violence; to provide leadership and support to the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women (NSC) and its sub-committees; to continue to implement the recommendations of the 1997 Task Force on Violence against Women; to consider and where relevant facilitate the implementation of internationally established best practice throughout the sector; to work with the National Crime Council and external bodies as appropriate to establish a body of research to inform future policy directions for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; to represent Ireland at international fora  which have a remit in relation to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">I am happy to inform the Deputy that the Secretary General and some officials of my Department met with representatives of the non-governmental organisations working in the Violence Against Women sector in June and discussed their concerns.  The recently appointed head of Cosc participated in that meeting. Since then she has met with many of the State and non-governmental organisations on a bilateral basis, in addition to chairing the two quarterly meetings of the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women (NSC) where she provided further clarity in relation to the remit of Cosc.  I am informed that all of these meetings were held in a positive and collaborative atmosphere and that a good foundation has been laid for work into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">I would assure the Deputy,  unequivocally, that the establishment of Cosc is to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated "whole of Government" response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which includes the key features — protection, provision and prevention.</p>

            <p eId="para_1654">The Witness Security Programme was established in 1997 under the direct operational control and administration of the Garda Commissioner in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic intimidation of witnesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1655">The Programme has been demonstrably successful and it has withstood legal challenge in both the Court of the Criminal Appeal and the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">Nevertheless, in response to some criticisms, the Garda Commissioner appointed an Assistant Commissioner to review the Programme in its entirety.  This review was substantively completed in 2005, and enhancements to the Programme's administration and operation have since been implemented by the Garda Síochána.  For obvious reasons, it is not the practice to comment upon the details of operating the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">I am aware of suggestions which have been made that the Witness Security Programme should be placed on a statutory basis.  The Garda Commissioner has informed me that he would not favour this approach, and I have no plans in that regard.  It seems clear, in particular, that placing the Programme on a statutory basis would have no effect whatsoever on the willingness or otherwise of people to enter the Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1659">There is a significant ongoing programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda stations and other Garda accommodation around the country.  The Garda Building Programme is based on agreed priorities which are established by An Garda Síochána.  The programme is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda stations and other accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">Approximately €37 million a year from 2005 to this year has been spent on a wide range of Garda building projects.  Building projects for new stations in Bantry, Ballyshannon, Roscrea, New Ross, Ballina and Oranmore, among others, have been completed.  In addition, a major building programme was completed in the Garda College in Templemore and a 252 acre site outside Templemore has been purchased for the development of a new tactical training centre for An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">In addition to the capital funding outlined above, a total of €8.36 million is provided for maintenance of existing stations under the Garda Vote Estimate for 2007 — an increase of €2.1 million on last year's allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">Major funding of the Garda Building Programme will continue with €260 million allocated for the refurbishment of Garda stations under the National Development Plan.  The Garda authorities under the new civilian accommodation manager are working on the development of a strategic multi-annual development plan as recommended in the recent report from the Garda Inspectorate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1664">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department's Decentralisation Programme is firmly on target.  Under the Programme, over 900 posts from my Department and its agencies are scheduled to relocate to seven provincial locations.  To date, over 400 assignments have been made and it is anticipated that close to 500 posts will have moved out of Dublin by the end of this year. With over two years of the programme yet to run, we will have a presence in all seven locations by the end of 2007 and this represents more than 50% of the overall number of posts scheduled to move.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">As the Deputy will be aware, the costs in respect of property solutions under decentralisation are primarily a matter for the Office of Public Works and these costs account for the bulk of the expenditure.  The non-property costs incurred by my Department up until the middle of this year, in areas such as IT, office equipment and training, amounted to just over €1 million.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_316">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1671">Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">In addition to the criminal law, there is a range of initiatives in place to get at the root causes of this type of behaviour.  The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  It operates on a nationwide basis under the supervision and direction of the Garda National Juvenile Office.  The Programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age, who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident, may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution.  In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers, who are responsible for administering the Programme at the local level.  It has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  The Children Act, 2001 gives a statutory basis to the Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">Garda Youth Diversion Projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour.  By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.  The Government is committed to doubling the number of projects to 168.  I recently approved the establishment of an additional 12 projects, bringing the current total to 93 throughout the country.  I hope to establish a further seven projects before the end of 2007, bringing the total number of projects to 100 nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">More broadly, a number of reforms have taken place in recent years to bring about a more effective youth justice system and these have been enshrined in legislation in the Children Act 2001, as amended.  The Act is based on the principles of diversion from crime and anti-social behaviour, restorative justice, the expanded use of community-based sanctions and measures by the courts, and the use of detention only as a last resort.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">Recent measures have reformed our entire approach to youth justice.  The Irish youth justice service, an executive office of my Department which is co-located in the Office of the Minister for Children, now has responsibility for developing youth justice policy and operating the children detention schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">Ultimately, offenders have to pay a price for engaging in anti-social behaviour.  I have therefore asked my Department to look at the question of what the Programme for Government refers to as community payback.  This involves those who have transgressed providing real services for the communities they have damaged.  It is the case that community service orders already mean some offenders make reparation to society generally, but I now want to examine the possibility of making a more direct connection between the offence and reparation to the community against whom the offence has been committed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">CCTV schemes are a strong deterrent in fighting crime and anti-social behaviour as well as giving communities greater peace of mind.  Both Garda operated and community based CCTV schemes have been set up, and such schemes will continue to be set up.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and the senior Garda officers responsible for the policing of that area, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the area including the levels and patterns of anti-social behaviour such as the misuse of alcohol and drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">Twenty nine committees are now operating on a pilot basis.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and I are examining what lessons can be learned from the operation of the pilot committees, and we intend to have committees up and running in all local authority areas as early as possible in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">Under the Garda Síochána Act it is open to me to set policing priorities for the Garda Síochána.  I am in the course of determining these priorities for 2008.  One of the priorities I intend to set for the Garda Síochána is to combat, particularly in cooperation with other agencies and the community generally, the problems of public disorder with particular emphasis on alcohol related behaviour (including under age drinking) and socially disadvantaged communities especially through utilisation of the legal mechanisms being made available, viz. ASBOs and behaviour warnings and closure orders.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1686">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 196 and 449 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">Existing legislation already makes extensive provision for unmarried fathers with respect to their children.  Under the law as it stands — section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987 — an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child.  Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, a guardian may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child.  Examples of such proceedings are applications for custody and access orders.  In making such orders and, in determining whether an unmarried father should be appointed guardian, the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  Where appropriate and practicable, the Court in making any order takes into account the child's wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In considering whether to make an order under section 6A or 11 the court is directed — under provision in the Act of 1997 — to have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">The Act of 1964 (by way of amendment in the Act of 1997) encourages parties to a dispute in relation to a child to agree on the custody or guardianship of or access to a child.  Prior to institution of proceedings the legal representatives of the parties must discuss with them the possibility of agreement.  The Court may adjourn any proceedings to assist agreement between the parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">These legislative provisions are extensive.  They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's care and upbringing having regard to the child's best interests. The courts have consistently recognised the wide variety of situations of unmarried fathers and have necessarily determined the question of their constitutional rights on a case by case basis. The judgement in the recent G. case reaffirmed this position.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">I am aware of the concerns of unmarried fathers regarding guardianship, custody and access rights and the issue of enforcement of these rights.  Operation of the law in this whole area is being kept under review in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1693">The Office of Public Works manages two sites with wild deer herds, Doneraile Park in County Cork and the Phoenix Park in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">The wild deer herd at Doneraile currently consists of 172 animals.  The last cull was carried out two years ago.  An average cull would consist of about 30 animals.  The question of traffic accidents involving deer is not an issue in Doneraile Park.  Tuberculosis has not been identified as  a problem at Doneraile.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">The wild deer herd in the Phoenix Park currently consists of 570 animals.  Culling is carried out annually in close consultation with the UCD School of Biological and Environmental Science, with the objective of maintaining the herd at a reasonable level from the viewpoints of both the herd and the Park environment.  An average cull would consist of about 60 animals.  A number of measures have been taken to reduce the risk of traffic accidents involving deer, including warning signs on the roads to indicate the presence of deer and  the closure of minor roads.  A study carried out on 150 deer carcasses from the Phoenix Park at the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Abbotstown, over the past four years has revealed no trace of tuberculosis in any of the animals.  These results tend to suggest that no significant problem exists with tuberculosis in this deer herd.</p>

            <p eId="para_1699">The Revenue Commissioners are the vehicle registration authority in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) may be payable on the importation of a vehicle from Northern Ireland into the State.  As a general rule all vehicles imported permanently into the State from Northern Ireland or elsewhere must register for VRT purposes at any vehicle registration office within one week of their arrival in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">VRT is charged on the open market selling price (OMSP) of a vehicle in the State on registration and is defined in Section 133 of the Finance Act 1992 as the price inclusive of all taxes and duties which a vehicle may reasonably be expected to fetch on a first arm's length sale in the open market in the State by retail.  The OMSP of new vehicles is declared to the Revenue Commissioners by a wholesale distributor, while the OMSP of imported second hand vehicles is determined by the Revenue Commissioners based on factors such as age, mileage and vehicle condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">Cars such as saloons, estates, hatchbacks, minibuses, etc. with less than 12 permanently fitted passenger seats are classified as Category A vehicles for VRT purposes and as such are charged VRT based on the engine size of the car using the following calculation: less than 1400cc @ 22.5% of OMSP; from 1401 to 1900cc @ 25% of OMSP; 1901cc and over @ 30% of OMSP; subject to a minimum payment of €315.00.  Car-derived vans and crew cabs of less than 3,500 kg gross vehicle weight are charged at 13.3% of OMSP, while commercial and agricultural vehicles pay a flat rate of €50.00 regardless of OMSP.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">The Deputy may wish to note that VAT is chargeable at the rate of 21% of the invoice price and is payable by a private individual at the time of registration for VRT purposes on all new cars brought into the State.  For VAT purposes, a new car is one which is less than six months old or which has travelled less than 6,000 kilometres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1704">Regarding the cost of administration, the Revenue Commissioners take an integrated cross-taxhead approach to the collection of taxes.  Consequently the cost of collecting VRT on the registration of vehicles sourced solely in Northern Ireland is not readily available.  However, the total cost of administration of all taxes as a percentage of gross tax receipts for 2006 was 0.77%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">The total VRT yield was almost €1.3 billion in 2006.  During 2006, the last full year for which figures are available, 11,236 second hand vehicles were imported from Northern Ireland, providing a VRT yield of €25.7 million.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1757">There is a North/South dimension to the work of a number of areas in my Department.  The lead North-South section in my Department is mainly involved in the process of agreeing corporate plans, business plans and annual budgets for the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), one of the North/South Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement.  In co-operation with sponsor Departments, it is also involved in agreeing guidance for the bodies on various matters such as proper financial procedures.  This work involves regular attendance at joint North/South meetings and liaison at official level with the administration in Northern Ireland.  For example, the recent plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) which took place at Armagh in July.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">My Department actively assists cross border co-operation through supporting the SEUPB in its role as managing authority to two EU funded cross-Border programmes.  The SEUPB is one of six North-South Implementation Bodies set up under Strand II of the Good Friday Agreement.  It operates under the political direction of the North South Ministerial Council.  The operating costs are met by my Department (50%) and the Department of Finance and Personnel, Northern Ireland (50%).</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">The two North-South EU programmes for the period 2000-2006 are PEACE II and INTERREG IIIA.  Successor programmes for the period 2007-2013 were successfully negotiated by the two member states and will, pending EU Commission approval, commence before the end of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">The aim of the unique EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation is to promote reconciliation and help to build a more peaceful and stable society in Northern Ireland and the six southern bordering counties, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  It has a strong cross-Border focus; a minimum of €87 million of funds, including the national contribution, will be allocated to southern Border counties in the public, private and community sectors, for the purpose of engaging in mutually beneficial cross-border peace and reconciliation activities.  The total value of the overall PEACE effort since its commencement in 1995 is €1,504m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">The value of the Peace III programme (2007-2013), including national contributions, will be €333 million. I am very aware of the importance of the work of the programme to the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">The INTERREG programmes aim to address the economic and social disadvantage that can result from the existence of a border.  Previous INTERREG programmes covered most of Northern Ireland and the six southern bordering counties.  However, the INTERREG IV programme (2007-2013) includes a new dimension as it also covers western parts of Scotland.  All projects must include a North-South element and the priorities in this area will be transport, business, and the environment.  A minimum of €70 million of funds will be allocated to southern Border counties with a view to promoting a more prosperous and sustainable cross-Border region.  The total value of the INTERREG IV programme (2007-2013), including national contributions, will be €256 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">With regard to the INTERREG Programmes, I am pleased to say that my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland (DFPNI), is hosting an INTERREG Information Seminar which will shortly be held at the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham, Dublin, on Tuesday 23 October and which will provide a full day's programme of information on all aspects of EU-funded INTERREG programmes in Ireland both North and South.  In addition to the Ireland-Northern Ireland-Scotland INTERREG Programme, this seminar will also focus on the increased potential for North-South cooperation in the INTERREG Transnational programmes and the INTERREG Inter-regional Programme of which Ireland and Northern-Ireland, the UK and other EU member states are joint members.  The list of speakers will include representatives of the Irish Regional Assemblies and the SEUPB.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">There are on-going contacts between my Department and the DFPNI and the critical importance of these ongoing contacts is well understood.  So also is the significance of the all-Ireland economy, and the National Development Plan for 2007-2013, the drafting of which has been coordinated by my Department, reflects the Government's stress on the importance of the all-Ireland dimension.</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">Last week on Wednesday 3 October, officials of my Department together with officials from a number of other Government departments, attended the Northern Ireland Economic Conference 2007 in Belfast and participated in the Conference workshops.  Therefore, I can assure the Deputy that the North-South unit of my Department is fully aware of the importance of the North/South dimension and is actively engaged in the planning and the implementation of activities in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1774">I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 217 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">The position is that the VAT regime and indeed the rating of all goods and services are subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can retain the zero and livestock rating provisions which were in existence on 1 January 1991, we cannot introduce any new ones.  Therefore, it is not possible to apply either a zero or livestock rate to the supply of live poultry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">Under Annex III of the VAT Directive, VAT registered hatcheries are liable to VAT at the 13.5 per cent rate on their supplies of live poultry. VAT registered farmers are entitled to claim VAT on their input costs which would include VAT paid on live poultry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">In relation to unregistered farmers, the Deputy will be aware that such farmers receive compensation for VAT paid on their inputs through the farmers flat rate addition. The flat-rate scheme, which is provided for under the VAT Directive, is a simplified and practical method of applying value-added tax to farming. It compensates unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services. This is achieved without applying the normal VAT rules on registration and returns. The farmers VAT flat-rate addition for un-registered farmers was increased in my last Budget from 4.8 per cent to 5.2 per cent. In this regard, the Government's position of maintaining the farmers flat rate addition at the appropriate rate has not changed.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_339">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1799">As signalled at the launch of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community childcare services with a focus on disadvantage will be introduced on 1 January 2008 and will continue to complement   the universal supports in place for all parents in the form of Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1800">Following the Government decision in July 2007 to adopt the new Scheme, officials in my Office wrote to all of the community childcare services in receipt of existing grant support to advise them of the changes being introduced and inviting them to attend information seminars which were arranged in a number of venues around the country for late September and early October.  These have taken place and have provided very useful feedback.  The details of the new scheme, the rates of subvention which will be available to community childcare services in respect of disadvantaged parents, and the timeframe within which the new arrangements are being implemented, were also outlined.  The information seminars are being followed up by updated information packs, which take account of some of the issues raised and responded to at the seminars.  These are expected to issue shortly along with the forms which the services will need to complete as part of the application process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">Under the new scheme, parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a €80 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a €30 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of €30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent and/or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">The transitional arrangements which accompany the introduction of the new scheme, will ensure that existing grant recipients can continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which is due to be received from applicants in November.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding  levels in July 2008.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1864">I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 and 224 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment, which is in recognition of the higher childcare costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over €400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose and regardless of whether they live in urban or rural areas.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">As signalled at the launch of the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community childcare services with a focus on disadvantage will be introduced on 1 January 2008 and will continue to complement   the universal supports in place for all parents.  The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) will see a €80 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions in respect of shorter hour services).  Parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will see a €30 weekly subvention in respect of full daycare (with pro-rata reductions).  A further subvention of €30 per week will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify under either of these categories will be charged the cost price for their childcare service, however, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent and/or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">The Community Childcare Subvention Scheme will not discriminate against rural services and the number of parents in rural areas supported by the new scheme is not expected to be lower than in urban areas.  Per capita, the majority of the social welfare benefits which are referenced by the new schemes are availed of by more people outside the Dublin area than in it and parents in receipt of Farm Assist will attract the higher level of subvention.  Data available from EOCP grant applications also suggests that the costs of running a rural service, and therefore the costs charged to parents, are lower than those for services in urban areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which is due to be received from applicants in November.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</p>

This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  As signalled when I announced the new scheme in July this year, the transitional period between now and 1 July 2008 will also be used to monitor and review the impact it will have on individual groups, on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which is due to be received from applicants in November.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to the scheme to secure the best outcomes for childcare services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered on the basis of this data and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.</p>

The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1907">I propose to take Questions Nos. 230, 231, 240, 243, 246, 254, 258, 273 and 293 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1908">My Department and the HSE have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State's drugs bill in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising continuity of supply or patient safety.  An HSE-led negotiating team, including officials from my Department, engaged with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI), representing the proprietary and generic supplier representative bodies, and completed new agreements with these bodies in mid-2006.  These agreements are in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1909">As wholesale margins are not addressed in the new IPHA and APMI Agreements, it was intended to negotiate direct formal arrangements with the wholesale sector. Following completion of the manufacturer agreements, the negotiating team entered talks with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributor's Federation (PDF).</p>
            <p eId="para_1910">Early in discussions, PDF refused to negotiate a new margin for community supply, based on its own legal advice that this was a contractual matter between individual wholesalers and retailers.  Subsequent legal advice to the HSE, confirmed by legal advice to my Department, indicated that, under section 4 of the 2002 Competition Act, PDF as an association of undertakings may not collectively negotiate fees, prices or margins on behalf of its members.  Given the fact that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) is also an association of undertakings, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with PDF or the IPU on fees or margins as such negotiations would place these bodies at risk of prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1911">In light of the legal position arising from the wholesaler legal advice, the negotiating team re-considered how best to address the review of pharmaceutical supply.  Based on the legal advice, a consultation process accompanied by independent economic analysis was considered the most appropriate means to allow for the determination of new reimbursement arrangements.  The consultation process involved direct discussion with wholesaler companies and a call for public submissions, published on 20th December 2006, in response to which a total of 161 submissions (including 143 from community pharmacy contractors) were received.</p>
            <p eId="para_1912">Following the completion of public consultation, and informed by independent economic analysis, new reimbursement arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17th September 2007.  The new price arrangements involved revised rates for community and hospital supply as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1913">Community supply — existing 17.66% wholesale margin reduced to 8% from 1st January 2008 and 7% from 1st January 2009;</p>
            <p eId="para_1914">Hospital supply — new interim margin of 5% from 1st January 2008 with further discounts for efficient ordering and supply in that sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">The new arrangements apply equally to the GMS (medical card) and the community drugs schemes (DPS, LTI).  The new arrangements do not apply to the Methadone scheme, which is a separate dispensing arrangement with pharmacists for the treatment of a particularly vulnerable group of patients.  No formal notifications have been received that individual pharmacists are terminating either their GMS/community pharmacy contracts or their agreements under the Methodone scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">In its examination of the issues involved, the negotiating team considered a reimbursement level that reflects the market value of pharmaceutical wholesale services, and security and continuity of supply at current levels to patients.  The evidence on which the decision is based, following examination of the issues, direct consultation and independent economic analysis, all indicates that the State is currently paying a premium for the services in question.  It is possible and necessary for revised arrangements to be put in place without a substantial impact on the delivery of such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">Information available to the negotiating team indicates that small and rural pharmacies typically receive discounts of 2-3% on the existing wholesale margin, while larger urban pharmacies and chains typically receive discounts of up to 12%.  Therefore, smaller and rural pharmacies would be proportionately less affected by the revised arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">In the light of the legal advice received, and following consultation with the IPU, a separate procedure was also agreed to examine available options for advancing contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.  This process is being chaired by Mr Bill Shipsey, SC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">The negotiating team met with the IPU on the 3rd October to discuss implementation issues arising from the recent announcement of new wholesaler arrangements.  Both sides agreed to continue to meet under the auspices of Bill Shipsey SC, to discuss the IPU's concerns on contractual matters, within the legal constraints.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">The negotiating team also had a constructive meeting with PDF on 8th October to discuss implementation issues arising from the new wholesaler arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_1934">Recommendations include support for health promotion initiatives that encourage greater community and family awareness of eating disorders, the further development of primary and community care services and the provision of a full multidisciplinary team in a National Centre for Eating Disorders for complex cases that cannot be managed by local child and adolescent community mental health teams.  Responsibility for the implementation of these recommendations rests with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">In 2006, €26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with "A Vision for Change".  An additional €25 million has been provided to the HSE in 2007, €750,000 of which is for developing services for eating disorders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the HSE under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.  The Executive, therefore, is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1961">There is no legislation in Ireland specifically regulating tattooing businesses. However, these businesses are required to comply with general public health and safety legislation in the same way as any other business.  The responsibilities of business operators include taking all reasonable precautions for the safety of persons using the premises. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 imposes a duty on employers to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable,  the safety, health and welfare at work of employees. Employers are also obliged to manage and conduct their undertakings in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that in the course of the work being carried on, individuals at the place of work, (not being employees), are not exposed to risks to their safety, health and welfare.  In addition, under the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981, a medical officer of health, or a health officer on the advice of a medical officer of health, is empowered where there is reason to believe that a suspected case of an infectious disease or a probable source of infection exists, to take such steps as are necessary or desirable for investigating the nature and source of such infection, for preventing the spread of such infection and for removing conditions favourable to infection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">The European Commission has initiated a project to assess the need for regulatory control of tattooing and body piercing and related activities.  The Council of Europe has also adopted a resolution on tattoos and permanent make-up (PMU) which recommends the principles that member states should take into account in their national laws and regulations. The principles relate to the composition, microbiological purity and labelling of products used for tattooing and PMU, the conditions in which they are applied, and the need to inform the public and consumers of the health risks involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">My Department is reviewing policy regarding tattooing and body piercing in the light of these developments. In the first instance, the focus is on the development of "good practice" guidelines for practitioners rather than regulation. The main objective of these guidelines is to encourage best hygiene practice by tattooists and piercers, thereby minimising the risk of infection and so protecting both the artists and clients. It is also intended to produce information for the general public about the possible risks attached to body-piercing and tattooing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1964">As tattooing is not regulated, there is no age restriction in place. However, this issue is being addressed in the context of the good practice guidelines for both tattooists and piercers.  Draft guidelines have been produced and these drafts have been the subject of consultation within the health sector and the wider public sector.  Further consideration of the issues involved is necessary before my Department will be in a position to bring the guidelines to completion. The intention is to have this work completed by the end of this year.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1970">The HSE National Management Team has developed a financial break-even plan aimed at remaining within its Vote for 2007.  The plan includes a temporary pause in recruitment. Other features of this plan include cancelling all foreign travel for the remainder of the year, cancelling all domestic hotel bookings for the remainder of the year, and reviewing all non front-line expenditure to ensure that it is authorized at an appropriately senior level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">This pause in recruitment was reviewed by the HSE National Management Team on October 1st. Based on this review, the HSE has decided that the financial situation is such that it is necessary and prudent to continue the overall pause in recruitment to the end of October.  However, the HSE recognises that there are some limited critical or exceptional circumstances where appointment of staff may be necessary in front-line services. Accordingly, the HSE has established a small group, chaired by a representative of the National Employment Monitoring Unit, and representatives of the National Hospitals Office, PCCC and other Directorates to evaluate, monitor and approve requests for derogation from the general recruitment pause. This group will consider such applications on a weekly basis during October 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">Additionally, as an interim measure, it has been decided that a derogation of the suspension in appointments should be made to facilitate the following service enhancements: staff recruited to establish and operate Cherry Orchard Community Nursing Units in Dublin; staff recruited as Case/Liaison Officers in respect of services for people with a disability; staff required to open a new Admissions Unit/Community Hostel for the Central Mental Hospital; and staff required to introduce the ‘Fair Deal' arrangements relating to Nursing Home Subventions for Older people.  There are almost 130,000 people working in the public health system and the temporary pause in recruitment must be viewed in that context.  The Board of the HSE is committed to ensuring that staff costs are controlled and managed to best effect, that an appropriate balance is achieved between clinical and non-clinical posts, that there is a better skill mix within the clinical areas and that staffing levels provide cost-effective and safe/quality care to patients. I share the concern of the HSE to ensure that patient care is not affected during the recruitment suspension. It is the HSE's clear intention that these measures, which involve 200-300 posts, will not impact on ‘front line' services, and it has made provision for critical or essential vacancies to be filled by re-deployment of existing staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">The Deputy may wish to note that employment in the health service has already increased significantly in 2007. In fact, 2,500 new posts have been authorised by the HSE so far this year arising from new service developments contained in the National Service Plan 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1982">In relation to the Group in question, an interim staffing grant application under the NCIP was recently declined by the Secretary General as the proposal did not demonstrate a strong focus on disadvantage.  In addition, there is an outstanding decommittal issue with the previous committee who operated from the same location.  The Group have sought a review of this decision, however given the EOCP staffing scheme ends later this year and will be succeeded by the NCIP's Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCIS) on 1st January 2008, it may be that the best interests of the Group would be served by applying under the new scheme.  I understand that contact has been made with the Group advising them of this option, and seeking guidance on how they would wish to proceed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_2000">As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-10 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2001">The EOCP has both an equal opportunities and a social inclusion focus and aimed to increase the supply of centre based childcare places by 55 per cent (or 31,300 additional places) over the course of the Programme.  This target has already been exceeded, with some 35,500 additional places already created under the Programme.  The NCIP has a funding allocation of €575 million and aims to create an additional 50,000 new childcare places.  It is expected that approximately 22,000 of these places will be in the private sector and 28,000 in the community/not for profit sector.  Twenty per cent of the overall places will be for children in the 3 to 4 age group and will provide an early childhood care and education focus.  As with the EOCP, the NCIP is a demand led scheme, with groups open to apply for funding from the Department through their local City/County Childcare Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2002">Experience gained under the EOCP has shown that it can be very difficult to accurately project how funding will be disbursed on a geographical basis over the duration of a programme.  A number of factors come to bear in this regard, for example, the mix of private/community services in the locality, delays in acquiring planning permission or engaging building contractors, difficulties in securing other strands of funding and the general capacity of voluntary and community groups to deliver on large and often complicated  projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2003">However, the NCIP has a particular focus on identifying service gaps and matching supply and demand for services at the local level.  In this regard, the City/County Childcare Committees have an important emerging role in planning and prioritising services in their locality.  This new approach is intended to maximise the impact of funding at a local level delivering valuable services to families and better value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_2004">The following tables provide details of funding allocated in Cork City and County under the EOCP and NCIP to date.  It also includes funding for a number of regionally focused projects, commitments to National Voluntary Childcare Organisations and City and County Childcare Committees.  As will be seen the total value of the funding allocated in Cork City and County amounts to €42.75 million under the EOCP and €13.4 million under the NCIP.</p>

            <p eId="para_3356">The HSE has designated four managed cancer control networks (coterminous with the four HSE administrative regions) and eight cancer centres nationally.  The two designated cancer centres in the HSE Dublin North East Region are Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_3357">I recently approved National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services under the Health Act 2007.  Arising from the designation of cancer centres and in order to comply with the Standards, the Executive has directed thirteen hospitals, with low case volumes (less than twenty procedures per year) to cease breast cancer services immediately, to be followed by further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services from twenty-two to the eight cancer centres.  A number of the thirteen hospitals have in practice already discontinued symptomatic breast services.  The National Hospitals Office has already planned the redirection of this symptomatic caseload.  Additional groups of hospitals, including Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda will be similarly directed, in line with the further development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_3358">The decisions of the HSE in relation to the designation of four managed cancer control networks and eight cancer centres will be implemented on a managed and phased basis.  The HSE plans to have completed 80-90% of the transition of services to the cancer centres by the end of 2009.  It is possible to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time ensuring significant local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then it can be appropriate for much of the treatment (other than surgery) to be delivered in other more local locations.  In such circumstances, it will be necessary that all cancer cases receiving care should be quality assured as part of the cancer centre's service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3359">Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services is a matter for the Health Service Executive and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular questions raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy in relation to the matters raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_3361">I am committed to ensuring that the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions in the country as quickly as possible.

The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved.  I have also made available an additional €26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of seven additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.   The static unit at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital in Cork is due to be completed in late Autumn and BreastCheck has confirmed that the roll-out will commence in October.</p>

            <p eId="para_3364">There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however in practice arrangements have been made in several regions to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of any arrangements for community chiropody services and the level of service provided were a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  I understand that priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_3365">My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_3369">An Expert Advisory Group on Diabetes was recently established by the HSE and is currently drawing up standards of care for diabetes. This process will take account of the Department of Health and Children's document ‘ <i>Diabetes: Prevention and Model for Patient Care</i>’. The group has identified as one of its priorities the development of an Integrated Care Model for the treatment of diabetes.  This model will focus on the joint participation of hospital consultants and general practitioners in the planned delivery of care for patients. The Expert Advisory Group has also identified the other areas of diabetes care that need priority attention such as retinopathy screening, paediatric diabetes, patient education and empowerment, and podiatry. It should be noted that the diabetic retinopathy screening to prevent eye diseases in diabetes sufferers is currently being rolled out in the Western region and in North Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_3378">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.  This contract between the HSE and the scheme administrator is for a two year period and expires in July 2008.  The HSE has informed my Department that performance indicators and penalty provisions apply to the scheme administrator in respect of this contract and penalty provisions will be applied by the HSE as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3379">The scheme is progressing as speedily as possible and every effort is being made to complete repayments. The HSE has indicated that the delays in making repayments under the scheme have been due to legal and technical issues.  Firstly, over 13,400 estates who lodged claims to date had not extracted a grant of representation in respect of the estate of the deceased patient.  In these instances the person entitled to extract the grant of representation has to be identified before an application can be processed and to date over 6,600 certificates of entitlement permitting individuals to apply for a repayment have issued. Secondly, there has been a high incidence of claimants providing insufficient information and these claims have taken longer to process as the scheme administrator must be provided with certain information in order to ensure that the correct person and correct amount is repaid. Thirdly, it has been necessary for the scheme administrator to visit over 330 HSE facilities to scan records which form the basis for the calculation of repayments. The format in which this information is held varies widely between institutions and usually includes a mixture of paper files, handwritten files and computer files.</p>
            <p eId="para_3380">The HSE is monitoring the operation of the repayment scheme and has agreed a range of initiatives with the scheme administrator to speed up the repayment process.  The closing date for receipt of applications is 31st December 2007 and I have been informed by the HSE that final repayments should be made by mid 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3388">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_3389">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3390">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_3415">With regard to the application for capital grant assistance under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 referred to in the question, I understand that it is currently being assessed by Pobal, the agency engaged to administer the grants.  Following the assessment of the application, a recommendation will be made by the Programme Appraisal Committee (PAC), prior to a decision being made by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3416">As the Deputy will be aware the NCIP came into effect from 1 January 2006, with an allocation of €357 million for capital projects during the 5 year period of 2006-2010.   This funding is allocated for each year subject to the rules governing capital expenditure and the multi-annual investment framework, which are also conditions of the sanction given by the Department of Finance each year for capital expenditure including the NCIP.  Due to the success of the scheme to date, the existing capital commitments under the programme has reached the approved ceiling of €132 million for this year and it is not possible for this Office to enter into further capital commitments under the NCIP before January 2008 when the ceiling will adjust.  However, should the application in question be assessed by Pobal and recommended by the PAC before the end of this year, it will be submitted for consideration and approval by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children at the earliest opportunity in January 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3427">I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 to 291, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3428">A key element of the National Disability Strategy is the suite of six  Sectoral Plans which were published by Government Departments last year. The Sectoral Plan for the Department of Health and Children sets out the actions to be taken to implement the Disability Act 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_3429">The development of the Department's Sectoral Plan is an important opportunity to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are considered in all health policy planning and service delivery. The provision of health funded services to meet identified needs of people with disabilities continues to be a priority for the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_3430">Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 was commenced on June 1st 2007 for children aged under 5. This gives people with disabilities an entitlement to an independent assessment of health and education needs and a service statement identifying the services to be delivered. A system of complaints and appeals has also been established. An assessment based on the needs of a client, independent of the costs of the provision of service, will be provided. The HSE will prepare a service statement outlining the services to be provided to the person. This is a very welcome significant step towards enhancing the level of support to people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3431">It is the first time that an independent assessment of need, conducted according to standards laid down and monitored by an independent agency, the Health Information and Quality Authority, will be available. The Act will also give us an accurate picture of service provision and of areas for improvement across the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3432">The assessment of need process is a matter for the HSE and I have referred this matter to the HSE who will be in a position to provide information in terms of the numbers involved, the appointment of assessment and liaison officers.</p>

            <p eId="para_3446">The provision and management of car parking facilities at railway stations, including the imposition of charges, is an operational matter for Iarnród Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_3447">However, I understand from Iarnród Éireann that as part of its upgrade of the railway system it has embarked on a major programme of upgrades to its park &amp; ride facilities throughout the country. As new and upgraded car parks, such as Gormanston, are opened Iarnród Éireann has decided to introduce a pay and display facility, with nominal charges of €2 per day, or €5 per week to cover operational and security costs, to discourage non-rail users from taking spaces and to reserve spaces for those who have to use a car to access the station.</p>
            <p eId="para_3448">The modest charges are significantly lower than that charged by local authorities for on-street parking, for parking at local authority facilities adjacent to rail stations, or the fee for Luas commuters at €4 per day.</p>
            <p eId="para_3449">The charges are in line with the guiding principles for the implementation of rail-based park and ride sites developed by the Dublin Transportation Office. These provide, inter alia, that rail users only should use park and ride spaces, and may have to pay to use them and those who benefit from park and ride should contribute to the cost of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_3478">The failure of efforts by the United States Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation earlier this year was a major disappointment and setback for the thousands of undocumented Irish people in the United States and for their families in Ireland. Given the present very difficult and divided environment in Congress on immigration, it is now widely considered that such comprehensive legislation is unlikely to be back before Congress in a meaningful way in advance of the next US Presidential and Congressional Elections.</p>
            <p eId="para_3479">In the aftermath of this disappointment, I made clear my determination to actively review the situation and to explore possible alternative options, including bilateral arrangements. In the months since the collapse of the comprehensive reform bill, my Department and the Embassy in Washington have been engaged in a wide range of consultations with Congressional, Administration and Irish community figures to assess how best to proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3480">My visit to the United States last week provided me with the opportunity to discuss the situation in detail with senior members of the Administration and with some of the key central players in Congress. While they all emphasised the present extremely difficult environment for making progress on immigration reform in Congress, I was pleased that they were very willing to work with us in exploring further possible ways for resolving the position of our undocumented citizens. This work will now be pursued by the Ambassador and his staff in Washington and will be reviewed by me on an on-going basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3481">I also reviewed the situation with the Irish lobby for immigration reform, and subsequently briefed them on my discussions in Washington, including the considerable challenges seen by our friends in Congress in achieving a breakthrough at this time. Finally, I had a detailed discussion on the situation with the Secretary for Homeland Security, Mr Chertoff, and had a meeting with members of our undocumented community in New York.</p>

            <p eId="para_3483">The case to which the Deputy refers relates to five Cuban citizens who were convicted in the US in 2001 on charges ranging from espionage to first degree murder. A panel of three judges from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned the 2001 convictions on 9th August 2005 and ordered a retrial based on new evidence. The Miami District Attorney duly filed an appeal against this decision and, following an appellate hearing on 14 February 2006, a 10-2 decision to uphold the 2001 convictions was issued on 9 August 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3484">I understand that a number of non-governmental organizations, including the organization named by the Deputy, continue to pursue issues relating to the convictions in question.

            <p eId="para_3486">The United Nations has the lead role in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. The Government fully supports the leadership of the UN Secretary General in this important work, and we welcome the ongoing efforts of the Secretary General's Special Representative to Cyprus, Mr. Michael Moeller, to bring the two sides together to seek progress toward a political settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3487">On 8 July 2006, the UN Under Secretary General for Political Affairs, Dr. Ibrahim Gambari, brokered an agreement between the President of the Republic of Cyprus, Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, and Mr. Mehmet Ali Talat, representing the Turkish Cypriot community, on a set of principles, recognising that the status quo was unacceptable and that a comprehensive settlement was both desirable and possible. They agreed to begin immediately a two-track process involving discussions by committees of issues affecting the day-to-day life of the people and, concurrently, of substantive issues leading to a comprehensive settlement. However, these committees were not subsequently established, due to disagreements on their respective mandates and terms of reference. Following a hiatus, consultations at official level on these issues resumed at the end of January 2007, though so far without any breakthrough.</p>
            <p eId="para_3488">On 5 September, the Special Representative facilitated a meeting between President Papadopoulos and Mr. Talat, the first such encounter between the two leaders since last year.  While regrettably no substantive progress was made on this occasion, we welcome the reopening of political dialogue which this meeting represents. We are also encouraged that the two sides have agreed to continue their contact through the UN, and remain hopeful that this dialogue may yet help to unblock the stalemate in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3489">Ireland will continue, through our Embassy in Nicosia and in contacts with the Embassies of Cyprus and Turkey in Dublin, to encourage both sides to renew their commitment to the negotiating process and the achievement of the objective of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal State through an honourable, balanced and durable settlement protecting and guaranteeing the basic interests and aspirations of all. I have made our position clear to successive Cypriot colleagues, and also to Turkish Ministers for Foreign Affairs, most recently Mr. Ali Babacan, whom I met in New York on 1 October.</p>

            <p eId="para_3491">My Department and its agencies are aware of the critical importance that the Government attaches to progressing mutually beneficial North/South projects.  The North/South Policy Unit of my Department is charged with co-ordinating the Department's work on North/South policy issues.  The North/South Policy Unit is also a liaison unit for the Department's interactions with InterTradeIreland, the all-island trade and business development body established under the Good Friday Agreement.  InterTradeIreland's statutory remit is to exchange information and co-ordinate work on supporting trade, business development and related matters in an all-island context.  My Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, which is a co-sponsor of InterTradeIreland, liaise regularly on policy issues, new initiatives and other matters of mutual interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_3492">InterTradeIreland has initiated a broad range of projects to address areas such as technology transfer, collaborative research and development, sales and marketing, and business capability improvement.  In the past three years InterTradeIreland has created and supported more than 20 all-island networks, all built on the principle of generating value through collaboration, and all delivering value.  InterTradeIreland has also been at the forefront of developing innovative resources in response to the opportunities of the modern knowledge economy, such as the ExpertiseIreland research portal, which involves a partnership with the nine universities on the island of Ireland and the higher education sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3493">The Comprehensive Study on the All-Island Economy, which was published last year, identifies collaborative actions where they are cost effective and deliver joint benefits to address the competitive challenges facing both parts of the island and the economic problems that persist as a result of the border.  A range of initiatives are underway to implement its proposals in areas such as Labour Market Skills, Research and Innovation, Trade and Investment Promotion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3494">The National Development Plan 2007-2013 sets out in detail a range of current and planned initiatives for North/South co-operation.  For the first time, the Plan also contains proposals for significant Irish Government investment in North/South projects and initiatives for mutual benefit.  These projects and initiatives will benefit the entire island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3495">Following the restoration of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive, the fifth plenary meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council was held in Armagh on 17 July, 2007.  This was a very significant occasion given that it was the first plenary meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council since 2002.  We now have the opportunity to progress a range of significant issues that will lead to a more dynamic and prosperous economy across the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3496">On 12 September, I joined Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Nigel Dodds, in Derry to attend the opening of the North-West Business Complex, which forms part of the North-West Business and Technology Zone.  This joint initiative between IDA Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland is receiving substantial funding from INTERREG IIIA to develop a world-class environment for technology-oriented enterprises in Letterkenny and Derry.  I look forward to working with Minister Dodds under the auspices of the restored institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement to jointly take forward pragmatic initiatives that will advance co-operation for mutual benefit.  Arrangements are currently being made to hold our first North/South Ministerial Council meeting on the Trade and Business Development Sector.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Deputy Séamus Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3505">The North-South Unit in my Department actively pursues opportunities to facilitate, strengthen and enhance North-South co-operation across the three sectors under my remit as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. The Unit also monitors progress on specific initiatives or priority actions in relation to North-South co-operation in the sectors in question.  In considering any such initiatives, the over-riding principle has been that they should offer clear and tangible benefits, North and South.  The Unit attends the various North/South co-ordinators meetings as convened by the Department of Foreign Affairs and also liaises closely with the North South Ministerial Council on relevant areas of interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_3506">As the Deputy will be aware, tourism was identified in the Good Friday Agreement as an area of co-operation and Tourism Ireland was established in 2000 with responsibility for the international marketing of the island of Ireland.  It is, in my opinion, an excellent example of the tangible benefits to be achieved from North-South co-operation.  The North-South Unit meets regularly with Tourism Ireland to discuss relevant policy issues and also various corporate governance issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_3507">North South co-operation on tourism also exists on a less formal basis in areas such as education and training; product marketing and publicity; tourism statistics and research and accommodation standards.  A variety of initiatives are being developed and pursued by the tourism agencies across these areas to deepen the level of co-operation that already exists.  In recent months, my Department has also been working with the tourism agencies, the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and the Special EU Programmes Body to advance the selection of tourism projects which may benefit from funding under the next round of the EU Interreg Programme in the period up to 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_3508">Furthermore, on the 8th November, I will be meeting the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Mr. Nigel Dodds, at the first North South Ministerial Council Tourism Sectoral meeting since the restoration of the institutions in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3509">In relation to sport, the two Sports Councils on the island enjoy a strong working relationship and currently engage in a number of joint initiatives such as the Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport and the biennial All Island Sports Development Conference.  I plan to attend the 5th such conference in Belfast this Thursday, 11th October.  Many of the National Governing Bodies of Sport also operate on an all-island basis.  The high level All Island Planning Group, which includes the Chairperson and Chief Executive of each Sports Council, meets on a regular basis to ensure consistency in policy and practice in sports development. There is co-operation on such issues as research, development of high performance sport and anti-doping.  The Group ensures that there is no duplication of effort in planning and support for governing bodies of sport and individual athletes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3510">On the arts front, the Arts Council and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland have developed a very close working relationship over many years.  There has been an ongoing programme of work and co-operation which is formalised through a number of formal structures, including Joint Plenary meetings, North/South Committee Meetings and North/South Senior Executive Meetings.  There is also ongoing contact, co-operation and information exchange between the executives of both Councils.  Both Councils have identified areas of common strategic interest, and have instigated programmes in the advancement of these.  The councils have successfully collaborated on a number of projects and there are numerous funding initiatives between the two Arts Councils in the literary, music and visual arts spheres.</p>
            <p eId="para_3511">For my part, I am very committed to pursuing the North-South agenda and will continue to make the case at political level for closer co-operation within my areas of responsibility.</p>

            <p eId="para_3515">The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3516">The 2007 Sports Capital Programme was advertised in the national press in October 2006.  The closing date for receipt of completed applications was 24th November 2006.  Over 1,530 applications were received for the programme and provisional allocations totalling €85 million were made to 935 projects on 5th April last.</p>
            <p eId="para_3517">When assessing applications, my Department uses eleven criteria to evaluate applications, some of which are more important than others and are weighted accordingly.  The Department scores each application according to how well it meets these criteria.  These criteria and weightings are reviewed in advance of each programme and can be subject to change.  In answer to the Deputy's specific question, these criteria apply to all sports equally.</p>
            <p eId="para_3518">When assessing projects, the Department may also consult with other Government Departments, local authorities, the Irish Sports Council and National Governing Bodies of Sport, particularly in relation to regional and national projects, before a final decision is made.</p>
            <p eId="para_3519">In relation to the geographical location of an applicant, organisations that can prove they are located in any of the recognised disadvantaged areas of CLAR, RAPID or in a Local Drugs Task Force Area are awarded extra points under one of the eleven assessment criteria.  In addition, applicants from disadvantaged areas only have to provide evidence of 20% minimum local funding as against the 30% requirement for all other applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3520">Further details in relation to the 2007 programme are contained in the Guidelines, Terms and Conditions which are available on my Department's website — www.dast.gov.ie.  The date of the next round of the Programme has not yet been decided.  As in previous years, advertisements announcing the next round of the Programme will be placed in the national press and application forms will be available at that stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_3609">I propose to take Questions Nos. 320 and 327 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3610">The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over.  All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.  It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_3611">The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_3612">Airlink Services are not covered by the free travel scheme.  However, there are several other buses serving Dublin Airport from the city centre on which the free travel pass can be used and so there is no question of pass holders having to pay to access the airport by public transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_3613">I am aware of the difficulties that some free travel pass holders have in accessing public transport and my officials have discussed this issue with the Commission for Taxi Regulation.  Various alternatives to the existing system, including the use of vouchers, have been examined.  A study, "A Review of the Free Schemes," published in 2000 under the Department's programme of expenditure reviews concluded that a voucher type system, which would be open to a wide range of transport providers including taxis and hackneys, would be extremely difficult to administer, open to abuse and unlikely to be sufficient to afford an acceptable amount of travel.  This position remains unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_3614">I will continue to review the operation of the free travel scheme with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements as resources permit.</p>

        <b>Deputy Richard Bruton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         if he will clarify the circumstances in which people on community employment can retain rent supplement; and if these rules differ for lone parents or families of different size and make-up. 
        [22352/07]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_421">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_3616">Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.  Many recipients pay more than €13 because they are also required to contribute a portion of any additional assessable means over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3617">Persons participating in community employment (CE) can continue to receive rent supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Since June of this year, under improvements provided for in Budget 2007, where a person has additional income in excess of the standard supplementary welfare allowance rate, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.  The assessment of additional income of participants on a training course, such as the community enterprise (CE) scheme, has always been a feature of the rent supplement scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3618">Under the rent supplement scheme, the rules governing the assessment of income derived from participation in CE schemes are the same irrespective of family size and composition. While jobseeker's allowance is replaced by CE payment when recipients participate in CE schemes, a lone parent may participate on a CE scheme and retain a considerable portion of his/her one-parent family payment; therefore, a lone parent has a higher assessable income for rent supplement purposes and consequently contributes more towards his/her rent.</p>
            <p eId="para_3619">Lone parents participating on CE schemes are not penalised for doing so.  For example, a lone parent with one child living in Dublin with rent of €200 per week, whose sole income is a one-parent family payment of €207.80 per week, would ordinarily receive rent supplement of €187 per week resulting in a net income after paying rent of €194.80 per week.  If s/he participates in a CE scheme his/her total income before rent supplement and before paying rent would rise to €402.50 per week.  In these circumstances, s/he would be entitled to €97.22 rent supplement and his/her income after paying rent would be €299.72 per week.  S/he would be €104.92 per week better off for having taken up a CE place.</p>
            <p eId="para_3620">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</p>

        <b>Deputy Michael Ring</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         the reason his Department is going the opposite way to the decentralisation trend by restricting the issuing of PPS numbers to one PPS centre per county in view of the fact that in the past people were able to apply for and obtain a PPS number from their local Social Welfare Office; the further reason the PPS application service is being centralised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_3622">My Department took over sole responsibility for the allocation of PPS numbers in June 2000.  At that time and to facilitate customer service, all Local and Branch Offices were delegated the task of allocating these numbers as required.  However, due to the significant increases in the detection of identity fraud and misrepresentation of documents my Department, after careful consideration, decided to rationalise the process to one centre per county.  This approach was acknowledged by the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office as a step towards improving control.</p>
            <p eId="para_3623">As centres are established emphasis is placed on specialised training and equipment and the development of expertise for the task of allocating PPS numbers.  As a result Departmental officials are becoming more effective in detecting false documentation and bogus applications.  Consequently there has been an increase in the number of customers prosecuted for attempting to obtain a PPS number fraudulently.  The establishment of these centres is also facilitating the introduction of an improved and more specialised customer service to customers seeking a PPS number.</p>
            <p eId="para_3624">Acquiring a PPS Number is a once in a lifetime event.  The majority of customers complete the transaction in one visit.  When applying for a PPS number, customers are asked to complete an application form and to provide documentation to establish their identity and address.  They are informed of their PPS number by post within in 10 days.  A considerable element of flexibility has been built into the new arrangements which allow customers attend the nearest or most convenient centre to their place of residence.  It is also worth noting that for all children born in Ireland, a PPS number is automatically allocated on the registration of the birth with the General Registrars' Office (GRO).  This is generally done through the maternity hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3625">The process of limiting the number of centres for PPS numbers is underway and it is expected that the full rationalisation process will be completed by early 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3627">Under provisions introduced by Regulations in October 2006 and subsequently in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007, payment of rent supplement may be withheld in respect of rental accommodation where the Health Service Executive has been notified by a housing authority regarding non-compliance with housing standards prescribed in regulations made under Section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions Act) 1992.</p>
            <p eId="para_3628">The Health Service Executive (HSE) has advised that it has received 18 notifications of failure to meet housing standards since the new arrangements came into place in October 2006.  A breakdown per local authority area is being obtained and I will make this available to the Deputy as soon as the information is received.</p>
            <p eId="para_3629">Where a notification is received from a housing authority in respect of an existing tenant it is recommended that the Executive would discuss the situation with the tenant and take whatever action it decides is necessary in the best interests of the tenant.  The objective is to ensure that substandard accommodation does not come within rent supplementation.  Overall, the arrangements are aimed at improving the standards of accommodation which rent supplement tenants occupy and at supporting the local authority in meeting their responsibilities in relation to housing standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3630">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the HSE.  The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Eligibility is in general confined to those who are in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.  There are currently just over 58,600 tenants benefiting from assistance under the rental supplement scheme.</p>

Likewise, seniors (over 65) in Northern Ireland can travel free of charge on bus, rail, air and ferry services participating in the Free Travel scheme in this State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3640">The scheme was launched on 2 April 2007. Funding is expected to rise to €1.9 million this year. While it is not possible to predict precisely the number of customers likely to participate in the scheme, approximately 220,000 cross-border journeys are undertaken each year by an estimated 40,000 passengers, and it is hoped that take up of the scheme will be high.</p>
            <p eId="para_3641">Secondly, in June 2002 the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) Plenary agreed that a dedicated cross-border website be established to counteract the complexity and difficulty people found in accessing relevant information on a range of issues from social security and taxation rights to housing and education. This work is being taken forward by the Cross Border Mobility Information Group, made up of officials from the two Administrations and the Joint Secretariat in Armagh.  My Department is represented on the Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_3642">Funding of €173,000 for the project was approved in July 2006 under the Peace II programme, and the contract to develop this website has been awarded to the Centre for Cross Border Studies (CCBS).</p>
            <p eId="para_3643">The website will be structured around the four concepts of "Commute", "Work", "Live", and "Study" and will include information on public sector issues such as taxation, social security and job seeking, health and education as well as private sector issues such as banking, housing and telecommunications. It is anticipated that the website, which will be a tangible and practical example of the two Governments working together for the benefit of citizens, North and South, will be available to citizens by early 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3644">Thirdly, the strengthening of links with Northern Ireland and direct contact between the respective social welfare organizations is very important. For the past number of years my Department has hosted a number of Information Seminars in partnership with the Department of Social Development (DSD) and the Social Security Agency (SSA) in Northern Ireland. The objective of the Seminars is to provide frontline staff with the level of information needed to promote and increase benefit uptake within both jurisdictions by sharing information and good practice, and developing links between the two organisations and the voluntary sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3645">Themes covered in past Seminars include Pensions and Disabilities (2003), Families with particular emphasis on Carers and Lone parents (2004), "Best Practice" within both Departments, and issues relating to posted workers (2005), and the Challenge of providing social services in multi-ethnic society, with a particular focus on the migrant worker mobility in 2006. The theme for the 2007 Seminar was "Supporting people in older life".</p>
            <p eId="para_3646">In addition, the ninth annual Social Welfare Summer School was held in the National University of Ireland, Maynooth College, between 12th-8th August 2007. This joint venture between my Department and DSD, which is hosted alternately between both jurisdictions, aims to provide staff in both Departments with the opportunity to study a specific policy theme in an academic setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_3647">Finally, common text, which appears in Ireland's National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 and in Northern Ireland's Lifetime Opportunities: Government's Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy for Northern Ireland, outlines how the UK and Irish Governments are committed to developing and promoting co-operation in relation to combating poverty and social exclusion.  It commits Ireland and Northern Ireland to preparing a Joint Report to include: an overview of areas of existing North/South co-operation; areas potentially suitable for further cooperation; and advice on the mechanisms by which this work might be undertaken and delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_3648">The common text also appeared in the Irish and UK's National Strategies for Social Protection and Social Inclusion (NSSPI), covering the period 2006 to 2008, which were submitted to the EU by each Member State in September 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_3649">In February of this year, approval was given by the British Irish Inter-Governmental Conference (BIIGC) to continuing North/South joint work to alleviate ‘social exclusion, poverty and deprivation to help create a more inclusive society on the island of Ireland'.</p>
            <p eId="para_3650">Officials of my Department continue their long-standing practice of liaising with their counterparts in Northern Ireland and other jurisdictions on matters relating to controlling abuses of social welfare schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_3659">The Family Support Agency was established in 2003 to bring together the pro-family related programmes and services which are designed to promote local family support, help prevent marital breakdown, promote continuity and stability in family life and support ongoing parenting relationships for children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3660">The Agency's main functions are to:</p>
            <p eId="para_3661">Support, promote and develop the Family and Community Services Resource Centre Programme;</p>
            <p eId="para_3662">Support, promote and develop the provision of marriage and relationship counselling services, child counselling services and bereavement support for families; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3663">Provide a Family Mediation Service throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3664">The Family Support Agency also has a responsibility to undertake or commission research, to advise, inform and assist me as Minister for Social and Family Affairs and to promote and disseminate information about family-related issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_3665">Investment in the Family Support Agency has more than doubled since its establishment in 2003.  Investment for each year since its inception is as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_3666">2003 €17.28  million</p>
            <p eId="para_3667">2004 €20.19 million</p>

            <p eId="para_3670">2007 €35.3  million</p>
            <p eId="para_3671">The scheme of grants for voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services is a non-statutory scheme of once-off grants to voluntary organisations providing a range of family counselling services aimed at enhancing stability in family life, and assisting families and their members to deal with difficult periods which they may experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_3672">In 2007 almost €10 million has been provided by the Family Support Agency and a total of 561 organisations countrywide received funding under the scheme. This record investment — an increase of one third in just 4 years — has been informed by research launched earlier this year which indicated that up to 70,000 people across the country benefit each year from counselling funded by the Family Support Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_3673">The following table outlines the total amounts of funding allocated for the scheme for each of the last four years. It also gives a breakdown of the total funding under each grant category:</p>

            <p eId="para_3717">The Family Support Agency (FSA) was established in 2003 to bring together the pro-family related programmes and services which are designed to promote local family support, help prevent marital breakdown, promote continuity and stability in family life and support ongoing parenting relationships for children.</p>

            <p eId="para_3720">In 2005 a review of the 1st phase of the Family Research Programme was commissioned and published in April 2006 ("Family Research in Ireland").  This review included an outline of research issues which now guides the current phase of the programme operated by the FSA.</p>
            <p eId="para_3721">In 2005 the Agency also commissioned a review of the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, operated by the Agency.  Published in 2006, several of the recommendations from the review have been implemented, while others will be considered as part of the ongoing development of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3722">The Agency has just signed a contract for a fundamental review of the Family Mediation Service provided by the Agency including recommendations to inform the future development of the service.  This project is scheduled to begin towards the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3723">In addition to commissioned research the Agency is funding research undertaken by outside organisations under its Research Grant Programme, through the provision of grants for projects which come within the Agency's research remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3724">In 2007 funding has been approved for 2 projects.  The first is a project, being undertaken by One Family, to examine the need, in light of increased family breakdown, for family and child contact centres and how best to meet that need.  The second project is being carried out by the ESRI which will use 2006 Census data and other relevant data sources to explore trends in family dynamics and family types in Ireland over the period 1986-2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_3726">The Family and Community Services Resource Centre programme comes under the auspices of the statutory Family Support Agency.  The programme provides for a network of Family Resource Centres which aim to help combat disadvantage by supporting the functioning of the family unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3727">The services provided and activities supported by the resource centres are designed to meet the needs of the local community and include the provision of training, information, advice and support to target groups and families in the area; the provision of education courses, childcare facilities to those attending such courses and the running of after-school clubs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3728">Family Resource Centres provide services for lone parent families, young mothers and others considered in need of extra support.  They can act as a first step to community participation and social inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3729">Family Resource Centres are run by voluntary management committees, comprised of members of the local community.</p>
            <p eId="para_3730">A review of the Family Resource Centre Programme launched in February 2007 showed that almost 850,000 visits were made to family resource centres during 2005, with 140,000 people receiving advice and information and almost 16,000 people completing training courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_3731">At the end of 2006, 100 FRCs were in place.  Six new centres have been approved for inclusion in 2007, bringing the total number of centres in the Programme to 106.  The six new centres are as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_3960">The average time for deciding an application for carer's allowance is currently 10.64 weeks.  During 2006 the average was just over ten weeks.  My Department's claim processing target for Carers Allowance is for 70% of claims to be decided within nine weeks of submission.</p>
            <p eId="para_3961">The number of claims for Carers Allowance submitted in 2006 at nearly 11,000 was more than 20% higher than the total for 2005. In 2007 to date (at 28 September) some 10,500 claims have been received.  A number of steps have been taken to deal with the increased volumes, including the deployment of additional staff and enhancements to processing procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_3962">Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if persons applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_3963">Many applicants for carer's allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed.   Such payments will normally continue until entitlement to their carer's allowance is determined.</p>
            <p eId="para_3964">Over 10,000 new claims have been decided this year (to 28th September).  The volume of claims decided so far this year represents a 5.6% increase on the total claims decided in 2006 and a 14.4% increase on the total claims decided in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_3965">There are currently some 3,100 cases at various stages of processing and awaiting finalisation.  Of these claims, some 2,800 were received in the last three weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3966">The large increase in applications for Carer's Allowance is related to the introduction of the Half Rate Carers Allowance payment which was announced in the 2006 Budget and came into effect from 27th of September 2007.  It is expected that the majority of claims currently on hands will be processed within the next ten weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_3972">One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement "<i>Towards 2016 </i>” is the development of a national carer’s strategy and this commitment is reiterated in the Programme for Government. The strategy will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community. While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly. Co-operation between relevant Government departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed. For that reason all relevant departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners. My Department, along with a number of others, is examining how this issue can best be addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_3975">Poverty proofing was introduced in 1998 on foot of a commitment in the first National Anti-Poverty Strategy. It is defined as "the process whereby Government policies and programmes are assessed at design, implementation and review stages in relation to their impact on poverty and on inequalities which are likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction". Since 1998 it has been a requirement for significant policy proposals to indicate clearly the impact of a proposal on persons in poverty or at risk of falling into poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_3976">Following a review of the poverty proofing process, the Office for Social Inclusion, which is based in my Department, has now produced a revised set of guidelines for what is now termed Poverty Impact Assessment. This change of name is intended to underline that the emphasis in the process should be on outcomes and that poverty impact assessment should form an integral part of the policy making process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3977">The revised guidelines are designed to better assist policy makers across all levels of Government in evaluating policy proposals in terms of their potential impact on poverty. They include a number of new steps to make the process more useful and transparent and a requirement to monitor the impact of any policy change.</p>
            <p eId="para_3978">The revised guidelines have been published on the website of the Office for Social Inclusion and have been presented to all Government Departments, who have responsibility for their implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3979">Support for the work of the Office for Social Inclusion in developing effective poverty proofing mechanisms is a key commitment in the Programme for Government. Following presentation, the Office is now commencing more focussed assistance to individual departments on implementation of the new guidelines. The experience gained from this process will also aid the development of training for staff in this regard across all government departments, as appropriate. The Office is also working with the Combat Poverty Agency on applying the new guidelines in a local government context.</p>
            <p eId="para_3980">I am confident that the new guidelines will serve as an effective tool in ensuring that the priority of combating poverty and social exclusion is kept to the fore in policy making and implementation at all levels of Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_3996">The BSCFA scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn.  The allowance is intended as a contribution towards meeting the full cost of school clothing and footwear.</p>
            <p eId="para_3997">Budget 2007 provided for an increase of €60 per child to €180 for children aged 2 to 11 years and €95 per child to €285 for children aged 12 to 22 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_3998">In 2007, it is estimated that over 170,000 children will benefit from the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme at an annual cost in excess of €38 million.

            <p eId="para_4002">The Early Childcare Supplement (ECS), which is payable in respect of children under the age of 6 years is automatically awarded when Child Benefit is awarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_4003">The majority of Child Benefit and ECS awards are processed either automatically or in a partially automated fashion for children born in Ireland once their birth details are registered with the General Registrar's Office.  Parents are contacted in most cases by the Child Benefit office within two days of the registration of their child's birth.  The Early Childcare Supplement is paid automatically when Child Benefit is awarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_4004">Currently Child Benefit section is processing a number of claims for children born outside Ireland but living here with their parents and for children living in other EU countries who have a parent or parents working in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4005">There is a total of 6,000 claims for non-national children resident in Ireland at various stages of processing prior to finalisation.  These cases tend to be slower to process as the customer must satisfy the Habitual Residency condition test and this may entail contacting employers, Department of Justice and other relevant bodies to confirm their status in the state.  In approx 40% of these cases — some 2400 claims — there maybe an entitlement to ECS in respect of children under 6 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_4006">A total of some 20,000 claims from EU nationals for non-resident children is also being processed at present.  EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country may have an entitlement to Family Benefits in Ireland under EU Regulation 1408/71.  The number of these claims where an entitlement to ECS may exist is estimated at 8,000 (48%).</p>
            <p eId="para_4007">Before payment of Child Benefit is made for non-resident children it is necessary to contact the authorities in the country of residency of the children to confirm details and establish what if any family benefits are payable there.  This process can take a number of months to complete and, as a result, the number of claims that has been finalised to date is relatively small.</p>
            <p eId="para_4008">The number of claims received from EU nationals for non-resident children is down approximately 50% on the same period in 2006.  This reduction in claim numbers plus the recent assignment of additional staff will ensure that the claims are processed more speedily over the coming months.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_4010">Under the terms of an earlier Social Partnership agreement the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with qualified child increases and possibly including other child supports such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, resulting in a single second tier child income support.  Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.  This commitment to examining such a change was subsequently embodied in the current social partnership agreement ‘Toward 2016'.</p>
            <p eId="para_4011">NESC research on the subject is expected to be available soon.  The council has indicated that, as the proposed second tier income support would represent a new approach to targeting, the issues involved are complex and there are technical and policy challenges to be overcome.  The Council's analysis of these issues will, when received, be of assistance in informing the future direction of child income support policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4012">€2.6 billion was spent by my Department on child income supports in 2006, with child benefit accounting for approximately 80% of this figure.  The substantial improvements in targeted measures announced in Budget 2007 for children in low income and welfare families will also have an important impact on child poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_4013">For instance, family income supplement thresholds were raised in Budget 2007, increasing the weekly payments of almost all existing FIS recipients by €9 for a one child family, to €111 for a family with eight or more children.  Research has shown that poverty is more likely to be concentrated in larger families and this improvement continues the re-focusing of thresholds towards larger families which started in Budget 2006, thereby further targeting resources at low-income households.</p>
            <p eId="para_4014">In Budget 2007 all three qualified child increase rates which had remained unchanged since 1994, were increased to a single rate of €22 per week.  In addition, the annual back to school clothing and footwear allowance, which provides income support for the poorest families at a particularly difficult time of the year, was increased by €60 for children aged 2 to 11, and by €95 for children aged 12 to 22, bringing the rates of payment to €180 and €285 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_4015">While jobs are the most effective way of lifting families and their children out of poverty, these changes represent a more selective approach to child income support through targeting children in poorer households while at the same time limiting the extent to which employment incentives are worsened.</p>

The report of the working group was published in September 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4018">The working group made nine recommendations with regard to the future administration of the back to education allowance scheme.

            <p eId="para_4056">The Pre-Retirement Credits Scheme (PRECS) enables credits to be awarded to persons who are aged 55 years or older, who are retired from the workforce and no longer looking for work and who, in the immediately preceding period, were in receipt of either Jobseeker's Benefit/Allowance or credits in respect of 390 days of continuous unemployment.  Pre-retirement credits can only be maintained through a signed annual declaration from the claimant (i.e. that confirms his or her unemployment and retirement from the workforce) and are reckonable for the Widow's/Widower's (Contributory) Pension, the Deserted Wife's Benefit, the Guardian's Payment (Contributory) and occupational injuries benefits only.</p>
            <p eId="para_4057">From July 4th, 2007 the Scheme was discontinued for new entrants.  This was done in conjunction with the phasing out the Pre-Retirement Allowance (PRETA) and is consistent with efforts being made to encourage and facilitate people to continue working up to and beyond pension age.  Labour market conditions have improved dramatically since the introduction of PRETA in 1990.  The practical effect of conditions in 1990 was that many long-term unemployed persons over 55 years of age were unlikely to work again, and it was not meaningful to continue to ask them to prove that they were actively seeking employment.  The drop in long-term unemployment since that time has meant that this rationale has largely disappeared.</p>
            <p eId="para_4058">People of working age who are no longer liable for PRSI contributions may opt to protect their pension entitlements by applying to become a voluntary contributor.  In order to be admitted to the voluntary contributions scheme, a person must have a minimum of 260 weeks of PRSI paid in either employment or self-employment and apply within 12 months of being insurable.  The requirement to have 260 paid contributions to gain access to the scheme is essential in that it ensures that the requisite number of paid contributions required is in place to establish a contributory pension entitlement.</p>

            <p eId="para_4060">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn.  The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.  A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course, and have household income at or below certain set levels.  People participating in Community Employment (CE) schemes are eligible to apply for BSCFA.  The Community Employment (CE) scheme is included, among others, as one of the qualifying payments for the purposes of the BSCFA scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4061">Participants in a CE scheme are assessed under the standard rules for BSCFA. The weekly income limit appropriate to a single person with one child is €331.30.

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_4064">Policy in relation to pensioner's incomes is informed by the wide range of research carried out in this area, both nationally and internationally.  Commitments contained in the Programme for Government in relation to social welfare payment rates and the overall targets for retirement income suggested by the Pensions Board in the National Pensions Review are of particular importance.  The latter, published in 2006, re-examined and reaffirmed targets suggested in the National Pensions Policy Initiative in 1998.  These targets, which have informed policy since then, recommended a replacement income, from all sources, of 50% of pre-retirement income and a social welfare contributory pension latest rate of 34% of Gross Average Industrial Earnings.  The increase in the state pension (contributory) implemented in Budget 2007 has moved the contributory pension ahead of the Pensions Board target and the commitment to a pension of €300 per week contained in the Government programme will, more than likely, see further progress in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_4065">The Department also monitors regular statistical releases such as the EU Survey of Income and Living Conditions (SILC) to track the effectiveness of income policies.  In this regard, using the official consistent poverty indicator, older people are in a relatively better position than the rest of the population with 3.7% in consistent poverty against 7% overall in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4066">The risk of poverty rate based on relative incomes is more or less the same for both groups with the rate for older people showing significant improvement from 2004 to 2005, with the rate falling from 27% to 20%.  Significant increases in pension rates implemented in 2006 and 2007 should see the position of older people improving further.</p>
            <p eId="para_4067">The over 80 allowance was increased in 2006 to its present level of €10 per week and there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to pay the allowance also in respect of the qualified adult portion of the pension.  There has been no systematic review of the adequacy of the allowance.  However, that Social Portrait of Older People, published by the Office of Social Inclusion earlier this year, shows that poverty rates for older pensioners i.e. aged 75 and over, were lower than for younger pensioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_4068">The forthcoming Green Paper on pensions will include a discussion on the incomes of older people, including the sources of that income and with comparisons of different household types, age and gender.  Trends in relation to poverty risks will also be dealt with as well as international comparisons of pensioners' incomes.  The Green Paper will be published shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_4069">The needs of older people have been, and will remain, a priority for the Government.  The Government Programme envisages a 50% increase in social welfare pensions over the next 5 years and further reforms and improvements will be considered in the context of the publication of the Green Paper and the development of a framework for long-term pensions policy that is to follow its publication.</p>

            <p eId="para_4074">On the current side, an amount of €436,500 was allocated to four projects in further current funding in 2007 (€10,000 — Finglas/Cabra;  €206,500 — Galway;  €161,000 —  Ballymun and €59,000 — Ballyfermot).  Overall, just over €12.9m is being provided by my Department in 2007 to cover the current costs associated with the YPFSF (staffing and associated costs).</p>

            <p eId="para_4143">Having the age limit for BSE testing increased has been a priority of mine since my appointment as Minister and I and my officials have pushed the case at every opportunity.  I have long taken the view that, given the significant decline in the incidence of the disease across the European Union in recent years, not least in Ireland, and the control measures in place, an increase in the age limit is entirely justified.</p>
            <p eId="para_4144">I am pleased, therefore, that the EU Commission has recently tabled proposals that, if adopted, will result, in respect of healthy slaughtered animals, for the testing of 100 per cent of cattle aged over 42 months and born before 1 January 2002, and 50 per cent of cattle aged over 42 months and born after 1 January 2002.  For emergency slaughtered cattle and fallen stock, the proposal is to test 100 per cent of emergency slaughtered cattle and fallen stock aged over 36 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_4145">Work is continuing in Brussels to finalise the criteria against which the performance of any Member State will be measured in order to avail of the newly proposed testing arrangements.  I am pressing to have this work concluded as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_4147">The Sheep Industry Strategy Development Group, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Malone, issued its report in June 2006.  The report contained a total of 37 recommendations as to how the future of the sheep sector could be secured going forward.  I established an Implementation Group, also under the chairmanship of Mr. Malone, in July 2006, to oversee the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_4148">The Implementation Group reported in April.  Most of the recommendations in the report fall to be implemented by the industry itself.

            <p eId="para_4149">In addition and in line with the Group's report, sheep farmers are major beneficiaries of various schemes being operated by my Department.  Under REPS 4, which I recently launched, a new supplementary measure aimed at sheep farmers has been introduced.  A budget of €28m a year has been allocated to fund the proposed new supplementary measure at an overall cost of over €170m for the period to 2013.  Assistance is also available to sheep farmers for on farm investments under the new Rural Development Programme.</p>

         if she will ensure that the EU is aware of concern amongst Irish pig producers at the alarming increase in the cost of feed imported into this country; the efforts she is making to ensure that the EU reviews its policy on trade restrictions which prevent EU countries from using genetically modified feed but where the EU allows other countries to export their pigs which are fed on this product; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4157">I am satisfied that the EU is fully aware of the rising costs of animal feedstuffs across Europe and the effect this is having on Irish pig producers.  In response to developments on the International cereal and feed market, the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers agreed to suspend the obligation to set 10% of arable land aside.  The Commission is also examining ways of synchronizing the GM authorization processes between the EU and the US</p>
            <p eId="para_4158">Animal feed materials used in pig diets, such as soya and whole maize, are derived from EU authorised GM crops.  All animal feed materials consisting of, or containing, genetically modified ingredients which have been authorised under EU legislation can be placed on the EU market.  In 2006 some 455k tonne of soya, 90% of which was declared as being produced from EU authorised crops, was imported into Ireland for use in animal feed, much of which was used in pig rations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4159">Imports of pigmeat from Third Countries represents less that 1% of pigmeat consumed in the EU.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_456">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4163">My Department and I have been particularly proactive in taking measures designed to minimise the risk of the introduction to Ireland of either Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) or Bluetongue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4164">With regard to the threat of FMD, I introduced an immediate ban on the importation to Ireland from Great Britain of live susceptible animals, fresh meat, raw milk and other products from such animals as soon as the first case of FMD was confirmed in Surrey on 3rd August.  I also instructed the immediate installation of disinfection points at Irish ports and airports.  My Department also published information leaflets for people travelling from Britain and published information notices in the national newspapers as well as providing advice to the organisers of agricultural shows.  Furthermore, my Department set-up a dedicated FMD website which contains a significant amount of useful information and advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_4165">Within days of the introduction of my ban on imports from Britain, the European Commission introduced a ban on the export from Britain of susceptible live animals and products, including those included in my earlier ban.  The Commission Decision was strictly enforced by my Department and a subsequent Commission Decision, introduced in the immediate aftermath of the first case in the second cluster of cases on 12th September, is currently being enforced by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4166">In the short period during which live exports from Britain were permitted, there were three consignments of live animals imported from Britain and all have been traced and clinically examined and found not to have any signs of disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_4167">With regard to Bluetongue, my Department and I have responded proactively to the increased threat posed by the spread of the disease across northern Europe last year by engaging the Department of Zoology at NUI Galway to assist in carrying out a comprehensive surveillance survey of the midges that potentially spread the virus.  In addition, my Department's laboratory service has been testing thousands of blood samples for any evidence of Bluetongue since August 2006.  My Department has also updated its contingency plans and legislative basis and has provided advice leaflets to farmers and the veterinary profession as well as having organised an industry seminar on bluetongue in July. Comprehensive information is available on the Department's bluetongue website — www.bluetongue.ie</p>
            <p eId="para_4168">The more recent detection of the disease in Britain, along with the rapid spread of the disease across northern Europe and its detection at more northerly points than ever before, inevitably increase the threat to Ireland.  On the 29th September, the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in Britain confirmed an outbreak of Bluetongue and immediately put in place the control measures required by Council Directive 2000/75/EC.  There is, already, as a result of the FMD outbreak in Britain, a ban on the importation from Britain of live animals.</p>
            <p eId="para_4169">With regard to the threat presented by both Bluetongue and FMD, my approach is to ensure adequate awareness of the diseases and, particularly, the clinical signs with which farmers, veterinary practitioners and other livestock handlers ought to be familiar and to encourage vigilance among them when inspecting animals.  In that regard, farmers and veterinary practitioners should note that Bluetongue is a notifiable disease and suspicions of the disease must be reported immediately to my Department.  My Department and I are very conscious of the need to ensure such adequate awareness and are keeping the communications strategy under constant review.</p>
            <p eId="para_4170">I am satisfied that the control measures currently in place are, at all times, proportionate to the current level of risk.  This is obviously a situation that also requires to be kept under review and I will not hesitate to refine and update those control measures should I be satisfied that the risk has increased and that further control measures are appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_4171">My Department and I have been working closely with the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in London, the European Commission in Brussels and, particularly, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) in Belfast.  I have been and continue to be in frequent contact with my Ministerial colleagues in London and Dublin while my officials are in constant contact with their counterparts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4172">On the issue of control of imports of beef into EU, this is primarily a matter for the EU Commission acting through its Food and Veterinary Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_4173">With regard to the importation of beef from Brazil, I wish to clarify that, firstly all imports of beef into the EU are from regions which are designated FMD free and have been approved by the EU for the export from Brazil into the Community.  Secondly the type of beef that is authorised is deboned, maturated beef which has been slaughtered in EU approved slaughterhouses and subsequently heat treated and matured following slaughter to ensure elimination of any potential presence of the FMD virus.  Thirdly the beef must be traceable for 90 days before slaughter and the animals from which it was derived have been resident for at least 40 days on the holding of origin in that state before slaughter.  In all cases, such imports must be accompanied by veterinary health certification from the competent authority in Brazil.</p>
            <p eId="para_4174">As I have previously stated, I have taken the opportunity to raise this point on a number of occasions with the EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr Markos Kyprianou.  He has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product imported from a third country, poses a risk to the health of EC consumers or livestock.  I have been informed that further FVO missions are being undertaken to Brazil and the Commission will reassess the authorization of exports from Brazil in the light of the outcome of these missions.</p>

            <p eId="para_4253">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.</p>
            <p eId="para_4254">In relation to County Kildare alone, the number of teaching posts in primary schools was increased to 1,286 for the 2006/2007 school year.  This figure has been increased again to 1,377 for the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4255">Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.  Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly.  School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).  In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_4256">A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 350 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</p>
            <p eId="para_4257">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_4282">I propose to take Questions Nos. 378, 400 and 429 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4283">Significant progress has been made in progressing a range of areas highlighted in the Report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences e.g. A new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of €1000 per school plus €10 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_4284">A revised syllabus in Junior Certificate Science was introduced in 2003 and it was examined for the first time in June 2006.  Revised syllabi in Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology have also been introduced and examined within the last five years.  Work on the revision of the two remaining Leaving Certificate subjects — Agricultural Science and Physics and Chemistry (combined) — is well advanced.  The introduction of each of the revised syllabi has been supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4285">Additional equipment grants have been provided to schools, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing school building programme.  In that context, €16 million was issued to schools in 2004 to support the implementation of the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus.</p>
            <p eId="para_4286">Investment in the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutes (PRTLI) is continuing apace to enhance and promote world class standards in research, innovation and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_4287">My Department does not allocate provision for laboratory technicians/assistants in second level schools.  The recommendation made by the Task Force Report in this area, in 2002 prices, was costed at €18.8m annually.  The current cost of such provision is estimated at c. €24.6m for science subjects only, but could exceed €120m annually if applied to other practical subjects.  While I have made it clear that I am not yet convinced of the need for lab assistants and that I believe that their provision would lead to demands for similar assistance in other subjects with a strong practical component, the Government is committed under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation to re-visiting the issue.  A decision on this issue can only be made in the context of the resources available from time to time in the Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_4288">As the Deputy will be aware, the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006 to 2013 sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and improve the uptake of senior cycle Physics and Chemistry.  These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach now in place at junior cycle is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used and that there is an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_4289">Other aspects of the Plan include: reviewing the implementation of the primary science curriculum to ensure its effectiveness in stimulating interest and awareness in science at a very young age, strengthening teacher training in this area, reforming maths and Leaving Certificate Physics and Chemistry curricula, promotion of science initiatives in Transition Year; and, the provision of information and brochures on science opportunities and careers, linking effectively with school guidance services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4290">Taken together, the comprehensive set of measures provided for in the SSTI will build on the improvements made in recent years and ensure even greater support for science education.</p>

            <p eId="para_4296">I propose to take Questions Nos. 380 to 382, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4297">I am aware of the needs of the visually impaired students in accessing educational materials in various formats.  As the Deputy is already aware, the National Braille Production Centre (NBPC), an integral part of the services provided by St. Joseph's School for the Visually Impaired in Drumcondra, Dublin, was established in 2000 to provide blind/visually impaired pupils at first and second level with textbooks in braille and other alternative formats.  The NBPC produces educational materials in braille, large print format and text only for children who are blind or visually impaired.  It is an essential service to children and young people who are blind or visually impaired and without it many of them would not be able to access mainstream education or be able to undertake the Junior and Senior Cycle examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4298">The NBPC provides an essential service to children who are blind or visually impaired and it is important that it is adequately funded to enable it to meet the needs of such children.  Many of the children for whom the NBPC caters are being educated in a mainstream setting and the success of the mainstream placement is dependent on suitable educational materials being available to these children in a timely fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_4299">Due to the technical processes involved, the NBPC requires a significant notice period in relation to orders for the materials in question.  In the case of late orders or other unforeseen circumstances where a delay occurs in the provision of books, officials from the NBPC, in conjunction with the parents of the pupil/student and the Department's Visiting Teacher Service for the Visually Impaired, work together to establish solutions to provide the books in a timely manner.  It is accepted practice generally that the Braille books are delivered in volumes throughout the school year, due to the lengthy transcription process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4300">My Department's Visiting Teacher Service for the Visually Impaired has a significant role to play in the process of ordering books or materials on behalf of a particular pupil/student.  In 2006, a protocol dealing solely and exclusively with the provision of educational materials in alternative formats was agreed between the NBPC and my Department's Visiting Teacher Service for the Visually Impaired.  The protocol was devised on the initiative of the Visiting Teacher Service for the Visually Impaired and will be reviewed very shortly on the basis of current experience in its operation.  Any amendments to the protocol will be put in place and communicated to all relevant interests, including parents, without delay following the review.</p>
            <p eId="para_4301">An Advisory Board for the NBPC is in place and includes representation from parents and guardians and other interested parties including the Visiting Teacher Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4302">My officials have met with the NBPC recently to discuss its operations and services and it is intended to meet them again shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_4304">The Higher Education Grants Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. These Acts define a mature student to mean a person "of not less than 23 years of age, or such other age as may stand specified for the time being in regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, who have secured places in approved institutions and have reached that age on the 1st day of January, or such other date as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, in the year of entry to such institutions".</p>
            <p eId="para_4305">Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</p>
            <p eId="para_4306">In order to establish that a candidate is an independent mature student documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate's ordinary/ permanent address from the 1st October of the year preceding entry to college.

            <p eId="para_4323">The National Educational Welfare Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board's functions locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_4324">The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide. Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme. In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Educational Welfare Officers play a pivotal role in implementing the service provided by the NEWB through monitoring school attendance and working to improve it. The EWOs also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.</p>
            <p eId="para_4325">In relation to the Deputy's specific question, I am informed that the National Educational Welfare Board are working in close liaison with the Health Service Executive to ensure that the child will attend a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_4331">Among the priority funding measures approved for support in 2006/2007 under the Educational Disadvantage category of the Dormant Account Fund and the RAPID Leverage Fund, was a scheme addressing educational infrastructure in disadvantaged schools.  Eligibility for the scheme was restricted to primary and post primary schools participating in my Department's DEIS programme; schools in, or serving, RAPID areas; and special schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4332">The scheme consists of four measures and a number of sub-measures. The four measures are: (1) Outdoor Play Facilities; (2) Libraries; (3) Parent Rooms; and (4) Dining Areas.  Eligible schools were allowed to submit prioritised proposals under each of the measures.  Proposals were sought in respect of improvements to existing facilities (‘enhancements' or ‘non new-builds') and the development of new facilities (‘new-builds').</p>
            <p eId="para_4333">A total of €20.5m, (€14.5m  from the Dormant Accounts and €6m from the RAPID Leverage Fund, which is administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs), has been made available to fund the scheme.  The scheme was launched on 16th January 2007, with a closing date for applications of 1st March 2007.  The scheme was over-subscribed with 2,271 individual project proposals submitted for funding. The total amount of grant aid sought exceeded the funding  available under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4334">The first stage of assessment involved proposals identified by applicants as Priority 1, 2 &amp; 3 under the Outdoor Play Facilities Measure; lower priorities were not assessed because there is insufficient funding available.  In July, €6.25m in funding was approved in respect of 447 Outdoor Play Facilities projects.  These projects are currently being implemented by schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4335">Phase II involves the assessment of some 380 library enhancement proposals. This work is at a very advanced stage and it is intended to progress the assessment in a matter of weeks. Phase III, which will involve the assessment of the Parent Room and Dining Area proposals, will occur subsequently.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4342">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism, receive an education appropriate to their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4343">With regard to specific provision for children with autism, the Government believes that as each child with autism is unique; such children should have access to a range of different interventions to meet their individual needs. Applied behavioural analysis, or ABA, is one of the methodologies used in special classes for children with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_4344">Advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the inspectorate inform the Department of Education and Science's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one. An analysis of research, including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism, also supports this approach, and autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one intervention. By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methodologies, including ABA, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.</p>
            <p eId="para_4345">The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. My Department therefore supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. It is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met. Whereas ABA helps to improve behaviour, other interventions, such as TEACCH and PECS, are important in developing children's communication skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_4346">Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has significantly improved in recent years and is a major priority for the Government. Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_4347">In excess of 265 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level and the National Council for Special Education will continue to establish more such classes where the need arises. At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants (SNAs). Extra assistants are provided where the children need them. An individual child can have access to full-time support from an individual SNA if he or she needs one.</p>
            <p eId="para_4348">My Department is currently funding an ABA pilot scheme which was established in the absence of this network of special classes in our schools. The Government is committed to long term funding for the centres participating in the scheme, including one based in Cork, subject to agreement on standards that will enable my department to support them as primary schools for children with autism. In terms of autism provision in other locations, we will continue to work to ensure that all children can have access to a broad programme, with provision for ABA as appropriate, in special classes.</p>

            <p eId="para_4373">I am conscious of the extent of housing developments in the Lucan area and the pressure that this has created for school places.  In light of this, the Department has expanded capacity significantly at both primary and post primary level to cater for existing and newly emerging demands for pupil places.</p>
            <p eId="para_4374">The Department monitors primary pre-enrolment lists in the area on an on-going basis to ensure adequate capacity and will provide extra accommodation if needed. A total of 4,832 pupils were enrolled in the 12 primary schools in Lucan in September 2006.  The enrolment figures increased to 5,128 this September and there are now 13 primary schools serving the Lucan area.</p>
            <p eId="para_4375">At post primary level, recent building projects have increased capacity to 3,000 pupil places which will cater for not only the current enrolments of 2,476 pupils but provide additional capacity of over 500 places.  In addition, a building project for Lucan Community College will further increase capacity by 200 pupil places.  A building project for St Joseph's College is also being assessed currently with a view to providing additional capacity at post-primary level in Lucan.</p>
            <p eId="para_4376">The situation will continue to be monitored to ensure that there are sufficient places to meet demand into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_4518">The decision on eligibility for third level grants and the issue of grant awards is a matter for the relevant Local Authority.  I understand, from the information provided by the Deputy, that the student referred to completed her undergraduate studies in 2004 and commenced her post-graduate study in 2006/07 when she entered the Higher Diploma programme.  The candidate is progressing, in the current academic year, to the Master's programme without a further break in studies.  On this basis the student must be assessed with reference to the terms and conditions of the 2006 scheme i.e. the Scheme relevant at point-of-entry to the student's initial post-graduate course.</p>
            <p eId="para_4519">In order to be assessed as an independent mature student the candidate must still satisfy the conditions at point-of-entry in 2006/07 even though the grant application currently submitted relates to the 2007/08 academic year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4521">The candidate will also have to satisfy the conditions pertaining to independent mature student status, as prescribed under the 2006 Scheme, in order to be assessed as such for the 2007/08 academic year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4523">The information requested by the Deputy is included in the table for the 2006/2007 school year. As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.</p>
            <p eId="para_4524">Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_4525">A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 350 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</p>
            <p eId="para_4526">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4695">As the Deputy is aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_4696">Two types of processing caseloads exist in the ORAC and the RAT namely, applications  which are prioritised on foot of a ministerial prioritisation direction made under section 12 of the Refugee Act, 1996 and cases in respect of which such a direction does not exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_4697">In relation to processing timescales for prioritised asylum applications, on 24 January 2005 my predecessor announced new arrangements for the speedier processing of such applications which were implemented with effect from 25 January. The new arrangements apply in the main to nationals of Nigeria, Croatia, South Africa and Romania and Bulgaria prior to their accession to the EU on 1 January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4698">In terms of timescales at first instance for prioritised cases, an interview date is usually scheduled within 9-12 working days from the date of the initial application. These applications are normally finalised within a further 5 to 8 working days giving an average processing time of 17/20 working days from the date of application.</p>
            <p eId="para_4699">The average length of time taken by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to process and complete prioritised appeals received from nationals of five countries — Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and South Africa — between 1st July 2006 and 30th June 2007 was 6 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_4700">In the case of  non-prioritised cases at first instance, an interview date is usually scheduled approximately 16 weeks from the date of the initial application. These applications are normally finalised within a further 4/5 weeks giving a total processing time of approximately 20/21 weeks from the date of application.</p>
            <p eId="para_4701">The average length of time taken by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to process and complete substantive appeals received between 1st July 2006 and 30th June 2007 was approximately 16-17 weeks.  Work is ongoing in the ORAC and RAT with a view to further reducing processing times for asylum applications. It should be noted, however, that the extent to which any period can be abridged is dictated in part by the necessity to allow an applicant a reasonable period in which to set out his or her claim in full. These safeguards are underpinned by the Refugee Act, 1996 itself. Also a range of factors can add to the complexity of cases notably where a case requires more than one interview or where the applicant is unable to attend an interview or hearing for valid medical reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_4702">I should point out that following significant additional investment in the asylum determination process over the past six years, considerable progress has been made in processing asylum applications in the State and in the timescales involved. The Government has increased staffing in the asylum and immigration area from 22 in 1997 to a current sanctioned level of over 700. The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service is also currently developing three major information technology platforms representing a combined investment of €32 million approximately.</p>
            <p eId="para_4703">This is evidenced, for example, by the fact that the number of cases which are over six months old in the ORAC and the RAT stood at 2,018 on 31 August 2007, as compared to a figure of approximately 6,500 at the end of September, 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_4704">As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, the Government in April 2007 published the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2007. The Bill sets out a legislative framework for the management of inward migration to Ireland and represents a comprehensive overhaul of the State's immigration and protection laws.  The Bill will integrate into the immigration code Ireland's processes for honouring our obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and other international, including European Union, instruments designed to offer protection from persecution and other dangers. It also provides for a single protection procedure within which all grounds (protection or otherwise) on which a person may wish to remain in the State will be considered together at the same time. This contrasts with the present sequential processes for considering different aspects of the same basic question.</p>
            <p eId="para_4705">This new integrated process will bring the State into line with processes in other EU States and will result in the functions currently carried out by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner being subsumed into the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS). The current independent appeal process for asylum claimants will remain with the establishment of the Protection Review Tribunal which will replace the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. This new body will have an expanded remit to consider, in addition to appeals against decisions not to grant refugee status, appeals against decisions not to grant subsidiary protection as defined in the EU Asylum Qualification Directive.</p>

            <p eId="para_4764">All incidents of murder involving firearms are subject to a rigorous investigation.  The identification of all evidence available is a key element of the investigation and prosecution process.  I am assured that all resources necessary, including national specialist units, are deployed by the Gardaí in the investigation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4765">Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda Síochána in combating serious crime and in particular murder.  Operation Anvil continues to provide successes in this area.  Figures which I received from the Garda Commissioner recently show that from its beginning in May 2005 to 9 September last, 768 firearms have been recovered, 37,437 searches for drugs have taken place and over 70,000 checkpoints established.  These figures make clear the unrelenting nature of the activity being undertaken by the Garda Síochána to deal with these crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4766">In addition the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation has been strengthened to 70 persons and is tasked with targeting organised criminals and disrupting criminal networks by providing armed assistance during planned operations and searches against those persons suspected of being involved in organised criminal activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4767">A package of crime investigation initiatives was recently launched by senior Garda management.  These include the establishment of a crime training faculty at the Garda College, Templemore to provide a professional, comprehensive training programme for those charged with the management of serious crime investigations.  Senior Investigating Officers will also be appointed.  These will be key personnel who will take charge of serious crime investigations.  Incident Room Co-ordinators will manage serious crime investigation incident rooms, and specialist victim interviewers will interview persons under 14 years of age or with special needs who are victims of sexual crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_4768">Additional Divisional Detective Inspectors will be appointed and will be allocated on the basis of one per District in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and one per Division outside the DMR.  The appointments of Regional Detective Superintendents, who will be responsible for the investigation of serious crime, were also announced.  Pre-screening and competency based interviewing have been commenced as part of the selection process for Detective Gardaí and Sergeants.  This will enhance best practice and procedures in the investigation of serious crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_4769">A Major Investigation Management System will also be developed to provide a PULSE based management system for all serious investigations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4770">As a result of the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 the Garda Síochána are in a much better position to ensure that those involved in gun crime will be made accountable for their actions.  The Act intensifies further the fight against gangland activity by:</p>
            <p eId="para_4771">making it more difficult to get bail in drug trafficking, firearms and other serious cases;</p>
            <p eId="para_4772">having tighter controls to monitor post-release activity by introducing monitoring orders and protection of persons orders;</p>
            <p eId="para_4773">having enhanced penalties for those who reoffend within 7 years of a previous offence;</p>
            <p eId="para_4774">giving further guidance on the application of mandatory minimum sentences in cases of drug trafficking and firearm offences, while fully respecting the discretion and independence of the judiciary;</p>
            <p eId="para_4775">providing for indefinite retention of fingerprint samples;</p>
            <p eId="para_4776">extending detention periods in the case of certain very serious offences; and</p>
            <p eId="para_4777">updating the law on the right to silence.</p>
            <p eId="para_4778">Yesterday I met senior Garda management  who briefed me on ongoing intensive operations to counteract the menace of gun crime, including Operation Anvil and CAB's efforts against drug dealers.  I assured the Commissioner that unprecedented resources would continue to be provided to support them in their efforts.  I wish to reiterate my call for all members of the community to support An Garda Síochána in their efforts to bring those responsible for these crimes to justice.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4780">The Immigration Act 2004 was enacted for the stated purpose of making provision, in the interest of the common good, for the control of entry into the State, the duration and condition of stay in the State and obligations while in the State of non-Irish nationals.  The Act of 2004 makes provision for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to appoint "such and so many persons as he or she considers appropriate to perform the functions conferred on immigration officers by the Act".</p>
            <p eId="para_4781">At section 4 of the Immigration Act, 2004, provision is made for an immigration officer to authorise a non-national to land in the State.  However sub-section (3) of section 4 enumerates, at (a) to (k) circumstances in which an immigration officer, may, on behalf of the Minister, refuse to give a person a permission to land in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4782">In performing his or her functions under the Immigration Act, 2004, an immigration officer is obliged, pursuant to the provisions of the Act, to have regard to all the circumstances of the non-national concerned known to the officer or represented to the officer by him or her and, in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, matters including the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_4783">(a)the stated purpose of the proposed visit to the State;</p>
            <p eId="para_4784">(b)the intended duration of the stay in the State;</p>
            <p eId="para_4785">(c)his or her income, earning capacity and other financial resources</p>
            <p eId="para_4786">(d)the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which he or she is likely to have in the foreseeable future</p>
            <p eId="para_4787">(e)whether he or she is likely to comply with any proposed conditions as to duration of stay and engagement in employment, business or profession in the State;</p>
            <p eId="para_4788">On arrival in the State, a non-national is obliged, pursuant to the provisions of the Immigration Act, 2004, to present to an immigration officer at an immigration control facility, for the purpose of making an application to land in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4789">Every person landing in the State is obliged, pursuant to the provisions of section 11 (2) of Immigration Act, 2004, to furnish to an immigration officer such information in such manner as an immigration officer may reasonably require for the purposes of the performance of his or her functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4790">One of the main principles of Ireland's immigration system is that persons coming to Ireland should not be an undue burden on the resources of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_4791">In application of this general principle, the child of an adult student attending an Irish university would be present in the State as a dependant of that parent who would be expected to have sufficient resources to provide for him/herself and any family members while they are in the State.  If the children of such a student were to be permitted to attend State schools it would be in conflict with the condition of self-sufficiency.  The fact that a parent is attending university and paying the costs of that course of study should not in itself permit their child to access State education services.  This policy has been in place for some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_4792">In relation to detailed guidelines relating to students, the visa requirements are set out on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website www.inis.gov.ie.  These are only guidelines however and the onus remains on the individual in all immigration cases to make whatever enquiries are necessary to be sure that their proposed stay in the State will be permissible.</p>
            <p eId="para_4793">In the course of making an application to land in the State, the person referred to by the Deputy stated to an immigration officer that his purpose for visiting Ireland was to undertake a course of study at University College Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_4794">The person concerned was accompanied by his wife and daughter when he presented at immigration control at the port of entry and the information disclosed caused the Immigration Officer to enquire further about purpose for visiting Ireland, in order to fulfil his obligations pursuant to the provisions of Immigration Act, 2004, and in order to establish the information he required to make a decision with regard to the application to land.</p>
            <p eId="para_4795">Following his conversations with the persons concerned, the Immigration Officer decided that the appropriate course of action for him to take was to refuse their application for a permission to land on the basis that circumstances enumerated at section 4(3)(k) of the Act of 2004 existed.  The Immigration Officer explained to the persons concerned the conditions of entry to Ireland that pertain with regard to the spouse / partner and children of a person whose permission to enter the State relates to the undertaking of a course of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_4796">The person referred to subsequently entered into correspondence with the Registration Officer at the Garda National Immigration Bureau who, having examined all the circumstances surrounding the arrival in the State of the family concerned on 7th September 2007, concluded that the Immigration Officer acted constitutionally and lawfully, reasonably, and in accordance with fair procedure and informed the person, in writing, of that decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_4797">The person referred to has been advised that the refusal to enter Ireland does not prevent him from making another application for permission, in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_4799">I assume the Deputy is enquiring about paternity leave rights of married and unmarried fathers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4800">I have no objection in principle to the introduction of a statutory entitlement to a short period of paternity leave.  However, I take the view that securing consensus among the social partners is a crucial element before doing so.  The Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to examine the possibility of introducing paternity benefit.  The question of permitting unmarried fathers to avail of paternity leave can be examined in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_4801">As regards practice in the EU countries, I refer the Deputy to the Report of the Working Group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 which was published by my Department in April 2002.  It contains at pages 45 to 47 an analysis of paternity leave entitlements in the 15 countries which were members of the EU at the time.</p>

            <p eId="para_4824">EU citizens and their non-EEA family members who have the right to reside in Ireland under the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 (SI No. 656 of 2006) have far more extensive rights than those accruing to non-EEA spouses of migrant workers.  Under the Regulations the rights of those EU citizens and their non-EEA family members are the same as those of Irish citizens in terms of the right to travel in or to or from the State; to seek and enter employment (apart from restrictions placed on some Bulgarian and Romanian nationals and as a consequence their family members); to carry on any business, trade or profession; to access education and training and to receive medical care and services.  Other rights under the Regulations include, subject to certain conditions, the retention of residence in the event of death or departure of the EU citizen, or in the event of divorce or annulment and the right to permanent residence after 5 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4825">In some cases the non-EEA spouse of an EU citizen does not qualify for residence under the terms of the above Regulations as a result of Regulation 3(2), as referred to by the Deputy.  This does not mean that in every such case the right to remain in the State is refused and the non-EEA national must leave.  Applicants who are refused under the Free Movement Regulations may be entitled to permission to remain in the State in accordance with national immigration measures.  The outcome of each case depends on its particular circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4826">The Regulations and the underlying Directive fully set out the rights obtained by EU citizens and their family members who move to the host Member State in the company of the EU citizen or to join the EU citizen.  Non-EEA spouses who do not qualify for residence in accordance with the Regulations cannot expect to obtain entitlements which are equivalent to the rights set out in the Regulations.  Outside of the Regulations these non-EEA spouses of EU citizens fall to be considered under national measures under which they may fare better or worse than other migrants depending on the circumstances of their case.</p>

            <p eId="para_4847">An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's question was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department on 14 April 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4848">Officials in that Section are currently processing applications received in the beginning of 2005 and have approximately 1,200 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person concerned.  These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  It is likely therefore, that further processing of the application will commence  in the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_4851">The persons in question submitted applications on 3rd January, 2006 for permission to remain in the State under the revised arrangements for parents of Irish children born prior to 1st January, 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 scheme.  However, as the closing date for receipt of applications under the IBC/05 scheme was 31st March, 2005, the applications in question were received too late for consideration.  Additionally, the Irish child in question was born on 18th August, 2005 which is outside the cut-off date of the scheme.  Consequently the applications and all supporting documentation were returned to the applicants on 4th January, 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_4978">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children, the first step of which is the issue of a behaviour warning by a member of An Garda Síochána, which remains in place for three months from the date of issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4979">I am informed by the Garda authorities that eight behaviour warnings have been issued to adults in the Cork City, Cork North and Cork West up to 31 August, 2007.  No behaviour warnings have been issued to children in these Divisions in this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_4980">Some inaccurate conclusions have been drawn from the fact no ASBOs have yet been applied for by Garda authorities.  The regime involves a series of procedures including behaviour warnings and, in the case of children, good behaviour contracts.  In setting up the regime, the intention was that these warnings or good behaviour contracts would themselves address the problem behaviour.  It is only if they fail that an ASBO will be applied.  In any case, it inevitably takes time to reach the stage where an ASBO itself might be sought.  Where these do not succeed in altering a person's behaviour, they will culminate in ASBOs being sought by the Garda authorities from the courts.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4985">The National Disability Strategy was launched by Government in September, 2004 and underpins the participation of people with disabilities in Irish society by building on existing policy and legislation.  The implementation of the Strategy is the agreed focus of disability policy under the Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016.  My Department is responsible for the provision of the framework for the implementation of the Strategy including cross-Departmental coordination and reports to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on progress of the Strategy.  Minister of State Dr. Jimmy Devins, T.D. has special responsibility for disability including mental health.</p>
            <p eId="para_4986">The National Disability Authority (NDA) is concerned with the implementation of important aspects of the Strategy and works closely with my Department to meet relevant objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_4987">Key elements of the National Disability Strategy include the Disability Act 2005 and Sectoral Plans for service provision for people with disabilities.  The Disability Act is the cornerstone of the National Disability Strategy and my Department played a lead role in its development and enactment.  Part 2 of the Disability Act commenced on 1 June, 2007 in respect of children up to age five.  All other sections of the Disability Act have been commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_4988">Under the Act, six Government Departments were required to draw up plans in key sectors including transport, built infrastructure, housing, training and employment, health and social welfare provision.  My Department acted as co-ordinator for the purpose of the Sectoral Plans and presented the Plans to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval.  They were published by the Government in December 2006.  Each of the relevant Departments has provided its own targets and costings for the implementation of the Sectoral Plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_4989">All public bodies, subject to certain considerations, must meet a number of requirements with regard to accessibility under the Disability Act.  These accessibility provisions are supported by the Code of Practice on Accessibility of Public Services and Information Provided by Public Bodies which was launched in July 2006.  The Code of Practice was developed by the NDA in consultation with my Department.  The Act also gives statutory effect to the 3% employment target for people with disabilities in the public sector.  My Department has a key role in relation to the implementation of these provisions while progress achieved by public bodies in this regard is being monitored by the NDA.  Again, under the Act, a Centre for Excellence in Universal Design has been established within the NDA with the support of my Department.  The Centre has an important role in contributing to the development and promotion of standards in universal design.</p>
            <p eId="para_4990">Under the terms of Towards 2016, the National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group was established in December, 2006 to monitor progress on the overall implementation of the National Disability Strategy.  The Group comprises representatives of stakeholder groups, senior officials and the NDA while my Department also serves as Secretariat to the Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_4991">The roll-out of the Strategy has been accompanied by a significant increase in the level of investment to expand the range of services and supports available to persons with disabilities.  In particular, the Government is committed to a five-year, multi-annual investment Programme to run until 2009 worth €900 million, targeted at high priority disability support services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4992">In addition to ensuring the delivery of key objectives of the National Disability Strategy, my Department has a role in several functions that are complementary to the Strategy.  My Department had a lead role in relation to the negotiation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which was adopted by a UN General Assembly in December 2006.   Ireland was in the first group of countries to sign the Convention.  My Department also has a lead role in relation to the ratification process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4993">My Department also funds certain accessible transport initiatives for people with disabilities, promoted an independent living support programme and provides financial support to People with Disabilities in Ireland (PwDI).  The total funding allocation for these initiatives amounts to €3.2 million in 2007.  My Department also continues to fund the Enhancing Disabilities Services Programme which was launched in 2005.  The Programme comprises a funding package of €15 million over a five-year period to support once-off projects which can demonstrate an innovative, efficient, collaborative and cost effective approach to service provision for people with disabilities.  The funding allocation for this Programme for 2007 is €3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4994">In 2007, my Department undertook a number of awareness raising initiatives including funding two TV programmes and a National Information Day.  The funding allocation in 2007 for this purpose is €434,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_4995">The Excellence through Accessibility Award was initiated to acknowledge public bodies that provide accessible services to people with disabilities.  The NDA in consultation with my Department, issued guidelines and the first awards ceremony took place in September 2006 at which four public bodies were presented with awards.  The second round of awards will take place in December, 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_5038">In relation to offences committed while on bail, the Deputy will be aware that section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment imposed on anyone for an offence committed while on bail shall be consecutive on any sentence passed on that person in respect of a previous offence. Sections 22 and 23 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 address an issue that may have cast doubt on the ability of the court to impose a consecutive sentence in a very particular circumstance, i.e. where the person is ‘unlawfully at large', having failed to appear in court as required by the terms of his or her bail. Under section 13 of the 1984 Act, that failure to appear is an offence and, following the recent amendment, it is now clearly established as an offence committed while on bail. As a result, under section 11 of the 1984 Act, as amended, any sentence of imprisonment imposed for that offence will be consecutive on any sentence imposed for a previous offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_5039">The Deputy will also be aware that Part 3 of the 2007 Act introduced several other important changes to the bail laws. These included changes designed to assist the Gardaí and the Director of Public Prosecutions in opposing bail applications by those accused of serious offences. In addition, there are numerous changes of a technical nature which will improve the overall operation and administration of the bail laws.</p>
            <p eId="para_5040">The changes introduced by the 2007 Act are the most extensive since the Bail Act was enacted in 1997.  Any proposals for further changes of that kind must await an assessment of the impact of these recent amendments as it will take some time before their effect becomes clear. In this regard, I would also remind the Deputy that the Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to assess annually the effect of the recent changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5041">Although it will be necessary to await an assessment of the recent changes, some ongoing alterations of a relatively minor nature will be necessary from time to time and will be dealt with as opportunities arise. For example, a small number of amendments to the list of serious offences listed in the Schedule to the Bail Act 1997 may be included in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is due for publication shortly. These amendments will take account of new offences and other changes as a result of the enactment of recent legislation, such as the Prisons Act 2007.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5043">I would like to assure the Deputy that I am committed to implementing all appropriate measures to deal with prisoners who may be engaging in criminal activities from inside prison cells.</p>
            <p eId="para_5044">One of the major challenges in prisons worldwide lies in preventing access to contraband items, primarily mobile phones and drugs, which for obvious reasons, are viewed as highly valuable commodities which could assist in illegal activity.  Efforts are made on a continuous basis to prevent the flow of such contraband into our prisons, by for example, the installation of nets over exercise yards, vigilant observation of prisoners by staff, upgraded CCTV monitoring, the use of screened visits and prisoner and cell searches.  In addition, new visiting arrangements are in place in all closed prisons whereby only persons who have been pre-approved by the Governor are permitted to visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_5045">I can also assure the Deputy that I am determined to deal with the problem of prisoners using mobile phones and, in this context, I believe technology offers the only real answer to dealing with the problem.  The first phase of a pilot programme to inhibit the use of mobile phones in prisons has been completed at Midlands Prison and the second phase of the programme is expected to be completed next month.  Evaluation of the project so far has yielded positive results and, if confirmed, the inhibitors will be installed in all our closed prisons over an 18 to 24 month period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5046">The Deputy will be aware that Section 36 of the Prisons Act 2007, which was brought into operation from 1 May 2007, makes it an offence for prisoners to have unauthorised possession of or use mobile telecommunications devices.  Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.  The penalty for such an offence, on summary conviction, is a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both.</p>
            <p eId="para_5047">Random searches of cells and their occupants and searching of correspondence and other items entering the prison have all intercepted significant quantities of contraband in recent years.  When a person is admitted to prison custody, he or she is searched and prohibited items and money are taken.  Similarly, searching takes place of prisoners returning from court, temporary release or after visits.  Searches of prisoners also take place where their behaviour or information received raises suspicions that they may be in possession of contraband.  The Prison Service has recently purchased a number of cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, U-bends in toilets, drain holes, under floor boards and other cavities.   These new technologies are proving to be a valuable asset in this area.  The planned new prison estates at Thornton Hall and Kilworth will also make it harder for contraband to enter the prison by locating recreation yards away from perimeter walls and having a cordon sanitaire.</p>
            <p eId="para_5048">As regards enhanced security, the Deputy will also be aware that I have recently announced a range of security measures aimed at keeping contraband out of our prisons.  These measures include: the establishment of an Operational Support Group dedicated to, and developing expertise in, searching and gathering intelligence.  The group will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific problem areas.  They will also gather and collate intelligence information in their prison, carry out high profile escorts and assist the chief officer in charge of security in the continuing assessment and improvement of security.</p>
            <p eId="para_5049">In addition, a number of serious gang members are now segregated in a special area of Cloverhill Prison.  This initiative, in conjunction with the other measures referred to earlier, will prevent them from exerting inappropriate influence over other persons.</p>

            <p eId="para_5108">Current staffing levels and configurations for each of the prisons were established in the context of the Change Agreement reached with the Prison Officers' Association in 2005.  The Agreement involved substantial changes to staff deployment which could only be achieved over time.  At present, staffing levels and configurations are quite close to what was envisaged when the Agreement was reached with the POA.  The Deputy will appreciate that in a large organisation such as the Irish Prison Service, surpluses and shortfalls in staffing have to be managed on an ongoing basis.  However, I am satisfied that there are adequate staff in each of the prisons at present.</p>

The situation will be kept under review by the Garda Commissioner and when additional personnel next become available the needs of these Divisions will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</p>

The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day the strength of the organisation, or units within it, may fluctuate due, for example, to retirements, resignations etc.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review by the Garda Commissioner and when additional personnel next become available the needs of these Divisions will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_6115">Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003. I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.</p>
            <p eId="para_6116">I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</p>

            <p eId="para_6133">Following consultations with the Garda authorities a dedicated Witness Security Programme was established in 1997 under the direct operational control and administration of the Garda Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_6134">The Witness Security Programme was established because of the rise in the criminal activities of organised crime groups, which increasingly attempt to corrupt and destroy the normal functioning of the criminal justice system by all possible means, including threats of violence and systematic intimidation or elimination of witnesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_6135">Protecting vulnerable witnesses has thus become a primary duty for States to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of their criminal justice systems and the continued safety and well being of their citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_6136">The potential intimidation of witnesses has long been a grounds for refusing bail (along with the possibility of flight and interference with evidence).  The Bail Act 1997 (following the Constitutional amendment) added the likelihood of committing a serious offence as another grounds for refusing bail.</p>
            <p eId="para_6137">Furthermore, the Criminal Justice Act 2007, section 26(4) introduced a new post-release order, called a "protection of persons" order.  Its purpose is to protect the victim "or any other person" from harassment.  The order applies where the person had been convicted of an offence on Schedule 2 to the Act (gangland type offences) and may last up to seven years post-release.  Breach of an order carries a penalty of up to €2,000 or six months imprisonment or both.</p>

            <p eId="para_6140">The Private Security Authority, which was established in October 2004, is the statutory body responsible for the regulation of the private security industry and for managing the licensing process.  The Authority has put in place stringent criteria to protect the industry from infiltration by criminals.  All applicants for licences, including company directors and major shareholders, undergo criminal record checking by An Garda Síochána, and applicants who have resided abroad for 6 months or more must provide a Criminal Record Certificate from that jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_6141">Currently, contractors operating in the door supervisor, security guarding, alarm monitoring and intruder alarm installation sectors require a licence as do employees in door supervisor and security guarding.  To date the Authority has licensed over 760 contractors and is currently in the process of dealing with 19,000 applications for employee licences.</p>
            <p eId="para_6142">In addition to criminal record checking all contractors must be tax compliant, hold a relevant standard from the National Standards Authority of Ireland and comply with company law.</p>
            <p eId="para_6143">The Garda Síochána of course investigates rigorously any reports it receives of illegality within the industry.The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day the strength of the organisation, or units within it, may fluctuate due, for example, to  retirements, resignations etc.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division taking everything into account.  The situation will be kept under review by the Garda Commissioner and when additional personnel next become available the needs of these Divisions will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_6145">I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that local Garda management take direct responsibility for missing person cases and special investigation teams are appointed as necessary.  All missing persons are recorded on the PULSE system and when a person is reported missing, the local Garda Superintendent will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary.  The systems put in place by An Garda Síochána to manage and deal with reports of missing persons are in line with best international police practice.  An Garda Síochána interacts fully and as appropriate with all of the media outlets — print, radio and TV — in highlighting cases involving missing persons.  The services of other external agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in the investigation.  In addition, every Garda District has a specially trained search team that is familiar with the locality.  The investigation of missing persons is a dedicated subject on the curriculum at the Garda College, Templemore and is also a subject covered in in-service training.The Garda authorities are continuously monitoring international developments in relation to investigations of missing persons in order to ensure that best practice is followed.</p>

Advice in relation to matters regarding the care of children in the detention schools is provided by the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS).

The priority lists were taken into account in preparing the Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 which I published in September 2007 and which is available in the Oireachtas Library. Given the level of competing demand for the available funding, and the priorities identified by the elected members of Waterford City Council, I regret that it was not possible to include the Blenheim scheme in the current Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_6254">The Water Framework Directive is transposed into Irish National Law by the European Communities (Water Policy) Regulations 2003, as amended.  The regulations require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish and maintain a Register of Protected Areas in accordance with Article 6 of the Directive.  These ‘protected areas' include all areas which are designated for the protection of waters, or for the conservation of habitats and species which are directly dependent on water.  All areas on the register will be shown on the maps associated with the River Basin Management plans, which are due to be adopted in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6255">The register maintained by the EPA includes all water-dependent Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs), and includes wetlands which are fed by groundwater, including fens. It also includes portions of SACs near the N6 as referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_6256">SPAs (designated under the EU Birds Directive) which host waterfowl such as geese will also be included on the register. Creganna Marsh is proposed as an SPA but the designation process is not yet fully complete. Once designated, it will be included on the register and mapped under the relevant River Basin Management Plan.</p>

Where one service is utilised, only the charge pertaining to that service applies.  In the majority of cases, both services are utilised and  the charges are combined to cover water supply and sewage collection and disposal, on the basis of the "water in equals water out" principle.  However, where there is a significant difference in the level of usage of the two services, a non-domestic consumer should discuss with the local authority whether it would be advantageous to meter separately its water usage and its waste water production.</p>
