          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_6">He has served the country with great distinction in recent years, particularly in recent months. While we all welcome the Government's appointment of Ms O'Reilly to the new post, we must ask the reason the appointment was not advertised. While the President appoints the Information Commissioner or Ombudsman, will the Leader inform us when the necessary resolution, which has to be put before both Houses, will come before this House? Is it normal that there would be no public advertisement of the post? It seems Ms O'Reilly, a very notable and distinguished journalist, was plucked from her career.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Yesterday the Government refused to indemnify Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin in respect of their upcoming High Court case against the ruling of the Morris tribunal. Does the Leader believe it would be useful and timely to hold a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss this important new development? If so, when are we likely to hold it? In the light of the meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to support the case of the Senator and Deputy, the fact that the case is not receiving the proper financial support of the Government by way of indemnification leads to totally new circumstances. The committee should meet to discuss the issue and inform the House who will provide the necessary financial backing and indemnification. The case is not just being taken on the part of the Deputy and Senator but on behalf of the Houses of the Oireachtas because of a fundamental principle or right which we believe is enshrined in the Constitution.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">Yesterday I asked for a rolling debate on Iraq. Although I had to attend a committee meeting, I looked at the Official Report and was very pleased with the Leader's response. She dealt comprehensively with the difficulty we have regarding information. However, she did not indicate that we would have the debate I requested. The House has an absolute moral responsibility to monitor the conflict, particularly in the light of what the Leader said yesterday about the information deficit and the great difficulty that the public and responsible, professional politicians like ourselves have in making up our minds on the real circumstances and in making political judgments on this basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">We learned today of the bombing of the Iraqi national television station in Baghdad. The other day, the US complained about violations of the Geneva Convention. This is another one. The Iraqi television station is a civilian operation, part of the infrastructure. This is forbidden by the Geneva Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Last night we were informed that there was an uprising in Basra. There is certainly some kind of commotion there. Coalition forces are mortaring it. The water supplies have been cut off. The inhabitants are drinking water polluted with sewage. There is some saline water which can be used for washing.

          <p eId="para_17">I would like provision for the rolling debate for which I have asked. In one television report I saw a British Army officer explaining: "We saw an Iraqi sitting there, whap he was taken out, whap our troops were in and whap 20 more Iraqis were gone with our zap squad."  Is that the kind of war we want to continue with? I am calling for a rolling debate every week, if not every day, if we have any shame.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_18">I join other Senators in saying that the new format of the Order Paper is a disgraceful example of environmental waste, particularly in a country with a waste crisis of unmanageable proportions. I gather the Leader made some reference to it. There are two pages wasted on the cover. This must add up to 800 pages produced every day. I do not recall discussion of these changes by any committee – I may have missed it. This is bad environmental practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">The Leader is very good at eliciting information. Can she then find out from the Government and inform us if there is a list in the US Defence Department which puts Ireland in the coalition of the willing? The Government accepts the view of US intelligence services that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Perhaps then, if they believe that the US can be so wrong about our involvement in the coalition, they will develop scepticism about things that are far less proven. Everyone in Ireland and in Europe knows that we are in the coalition. The Government is the only one that does not know.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">The events now occurring in Iraq have brought about a profound change in the way the world is ordered. Anyone who pretends otherwise is fooling themselves. This is the first time that two democracies – the US and the UK – have undertaken a "pre-emptive war". This marks a fundamental change in world values. It is something that threatens the way we look at the world – the way in which Éamon de Valera looked at it and how we now look at it. The Government walked us into this situation by pretending it would not happen, by hoping it would not happen. When it did happen the Government pretended we were not involved, but claimed at the same time that if non-involvement was demonstrated, it would be seen as a hostile act by the coalition. There should be a continuing debate on this crisis. With so much fiction and spinning in the reports we are receiving, we need to know the Department of Foreign Affairs judgment on this crisis on at least a weekly basis. I support Senator Norris in his request for this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I rarely object to early signature motions, because there is usually a good reason for them. However, with the Finance Bill 2003, we are having to go around the provisions of the Constitution – legally I admit – because the Minister for Finance wanted to go to the Cheltenham Festival for a week.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">Can we have a debate on crime levels? Figures published this morning showed an increase in the number of public order offences. This is not scaremongering. We are talking about increases of 50 and 60% in a year for some categories. If this trend continues, we will have uncontrollable streets. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should explain to the House how he proposes to solve the problem and listen to the wisdom of Members as to what else can be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">It strikes me that some of the contributions to the Seanad have a far more detrimental effect on the forest than the two cover pages of the Order Paper.

          <p eId="para_31">The situation in Iraq should be kept under review by the House. The Leader indicated that yesterday. It is a cliché to say that truth is the first casualty in war. Propaganda from this House would be just as useless as it is from any other quarter. It might be useful if a debate on the Iraq crisis concentrated on what we can do as a country. I welcome the Government's allocation of €5 million to humanitarian aid. We should concentrate on how best this can be used in minimising the civilian suffering in Iraq. I would welcome such a debate in the House with Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">There has been much discussion on road safety, the role of the Garda and speeding ministerial cars. The Minister for Transport should be asked about Bus Éireann's policy on speeding. When travelling on the Naas dual carriageway, I observed one Bus Éireann bus overtake me as I travelled at 60 mph. I also observed a bus travelling at night with no lights save its indicators flashing. What is Bus Éireann's attitude to road safety?</p>

          <p eId="para_33">I read in the paper this morning that the Garda Síochána had detected 80,000 offences which were directly linked to alcohol. Could the Leader invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to discuss this issue of crime and under age drinking, which has got out of hand? I would like the Leader to ask the Minister today why he has not introduced the regulation under section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 to provide that off-licences should label bottles and cans with their names. This regulation would be a means by which the Garda could track down the off-licence holders who are selling drink to under age customers.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">Members of this House, regardless of how long they have been here, have the same rights as long-standing Members. I have exercised as much responsibility over the years as Senator Norris, and I do not believe histrionics on a daily basis have anything to contribute to debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">I join the Leader of the Opposition in congratulating Ms Emily O'Reilly on her appointment as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. It is pertinent that we were debating the Freedom of Information Bill last week. I am sure that she will show the same vigorous independence as the Minister who has appointed her. I also offer my best wishes to the retiring commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy, and thank him for his long career of public service. It should be remembered that he played a very important role in the early partnership agreements.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_40">I too, ask the Leader if we could have a debate this week on the situation in Iraq. It is important to remember that the civilian casualties are not only people who are hit by bombs, shrapnel, bullets or even collapsing buildings. The hospitals there have pointed out the huge increase in the number of people attending with stress related conditions such as strokes and coronaries, and the dreadful plight of terrified children.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Regarding the Order Paper I wish that former Progressive Democrats Senator, Maureen Quill, were here because she was a great woman for pointing out the waste of paper in this House. She wanted us to request reports rather than receive them regularly in the post because she said in that way we were much more likely to pay attention to them. She would have had some very firm words about this which I consider to be a terrible waste of paper because it is gone at the end of the day.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I appreciate the Leader's comments of yesterday morning in regard to Iraq. They made me feel more comfortable. I support the call for a more regular debate on the situation there. We had a good debate in this House last week. It was very dignified and balanced and while many of us held differing views at least we could express them. I expressed my view that the war in Iraq is illegal, unjust and immoral.</p>

I could not feel comfortable with the newspaper photograph of a defenceless Iraqi child with her limbs shattered by bombs. We in this House need to come together, irrespective of party support or affiliation, and work in a united way morally and politically. It is important because one cannot draw a line in the sand and say that is the end of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">I admire Senator Norris for his tenacity and independence. We should be allowed to express our views because I am horrified and traumatised by this war and there are thousands of other people who feel the same way. It behoves us as legislators to give leadership at a time like this. That is why I request more regular debates than we have had on this issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_47">A number of other speakers have touched on the issue I want to raise, namely the results of Operation Encounter. The Garda Commissioner set up this operation on 23 February 2002 to focus on drink related crime in different venues such as pubs, night clubs, and fast food outlets. It has highlighted a number of alarming statistics, not least that 25 people are assaulted every night in drink related crime. I ask the Leader of the House to summon the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address this with due urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">The second issue is in relation to our €5 million humanitarian aid package. Does the Leader know whether this allocation was originally destined for another poor country? If that is the case, is it right that we should take €5 million from one poor country and spend it in Iraq cleaning up the mess left by the Americans?</p>

          <p eId="para_49">I too join previous speakers in calling for a weekly debate on Iraq. There is no doubt that the different views held here and in the community have to be reflected and respected, and a debate would at least help to correct the selective inaccuracies being peddled by some. This is important for us and for the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">There are two points that I would like the Leader to raise on my behalf. On several occasions I have raised the issue of the contract for the Cork School of Music, but despite having tabled it on the Adjournment and raising it in many different forms I have yet to receive an answer. The people of Cork are also awaiting an answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">I will be brief. I support Senator Norris's call for an urgent debate on the war in Iraq. As each day goes by it seems that the civilian population of Iraq becomes more and more a pawn in the conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children into the House as a matter of urgency next week to discuss the report of the task force on medical staffing because there are many hospitals experiencing great uncertainty about the proposed cutbacks and downgrading. I believe the Minister has that final report now but for some reason – obviously a political one – he is delaying its release. Could the Leader request the Minister to come in here to allay people's fears? Some of these fears may be unfounded but others may have serious consequences for many hospitals, particularly Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, which is due to be downgraded.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">I support the call for a debate on crime and the related issue of under age drinking. We have spoken of the Minister's role and that of the Garda, but we have not spoken of the responsibility of parents to monitor the behaviour of their children in relation to under age drinking. If we fail to adopt a community-spirited approach, we will not be successful in combating this problem. It is a disgrace and a cause of upset for the community in general.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">I thank Senators on all sides for their expressions of solidarity and support for Deputy Howlin and me in our determination to refuse to be compelled to reveal our sources in regard to alleged Garda misconduct in Donegal. Yesterday's Government decision is a setback, not only from the perspective of potential punitive legal costs but also from the point of view of our collective determination to defend our constitutional right and duty to protect our sources. I would welcome a meeting of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges to discuss this matter as soon as possible. In particular, I thank Senators on the Government side for the endorsement, support and encouragement they have given us.</p>

The choice of appointee is interesting and exciting.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to reflect on the propriety of allowing uniformed officers of the Defence Forces to pontificate on television with regard to a war in which we play no part? Such behaviour seems odd.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">In welcoming Senator Minihan to this side of the House, I confuse matters further by complimenting the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, on his proactive work in the area of mental health. We must engage in ongoing debate on mental health. There is a correlation between the high level of mental ill-health and the lack of consultants and psychologists. Many consultants and psychologists work in affluent areas. While I welcome the Leader's positive attitude to the organisation of a debate on suicide, there is a broad range of mental health issues it is important to discuss. I welcome the call for a debate on the Iraqi war, which is very serious. The visit of Tony Blair to Washington today proves that he is panicking because he is worried about the post-war plans of President Bush.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">Senator Dardis also requested a debate on Iraq and humanitarian aid. He wishes the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to discuss the matter in the House. The Senator asked if Bus Éireann vehicles are subject to speed limits which, of course, they should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Senator Terry said the Garda had detected 80,000 instances of crime which were directly related to alcohol and asked when section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 will be implemented.

I understand there are discretionary funds for use in war-torn countries which can be used when the need arises. It has not been taken directly from funds set aside for any other country. The ODA budget is not automatically parcelled out under various subheads.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_119">In page 4, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_120">"3.–The Minister shall, as soon as may be, after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the adverse financial effect to lone parents in returning to the workforce under the Fás Jobs Initiative Programme and to report on the number of lone parents who have seen a reduction in their weekly income as a result of recent wage increases under the Programme.".</p>
          <p eId="para_121">Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 relate to the same issue which was also debated in the other House on Committee Stage. It has to do with lone parents. The relatively small increases in payment given to those participating in FÁS schemes such as the community employment scheme and jobs initiative programme have led to a dramatic reduction in the number of lone parents participating. I recently attended a meeting in my constituency where many lone parents spoke to me about this issue. They said it was not worth their while participating in schemes because they had lost so much in their total payment. This anomaly must be corrected. The Minister said in the other House that she was prepared to examine the issue by way of FIS, family income supplement. I have tabled these amendments to see how the situation can be ameliorated. I am sure the Minister will agree with me that these are very good schemes which help many women return to the workforce. If a financial disincentive is created, people will not be inclined to take up these jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">The second amendment deals with a particular problem. Up to now a person working under the jobs initiative scheme did not pay any PRSI. The recent €10 increase under the scheme means that the PRSI ceiling has been breached for the first time for those in this category. They are now paying PRSI for the first time. The matter has been brought to my attention by three separate groups in my constituency. In the past there were incremental increases in the PRSI ceiling, so why is there no increase this year? People on JI schemes will now pay PRSI for the first time. It was never the intention that this should happen. These people will find themselves in the PRSI net, which is another disincentive for those trying to get back to work. I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on amendments Nos. 1 and 2.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_123">There have been protracted discussions on the jobs initiative scheme. I am aware there were several public meetings, particularly in the Senator's constituency, because of the impact the scheme has had. This was to have been a one-year scheme which would lead to employment. As a consequence, it was seen as a pathway through which people could obtain work.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The issue of income thresholds is an aspect of social policy. The current threshold is €298.40 per week. Lone parents, in particular, have been able to retain their full benefit plus their jobs initiative funding, but a difficulty is created if they progress beyond the threshold.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">I have debated the scheme on many occasions with colleagues in both Houses. There were newspaper headlines to the effect that people would lose €60 per week, which is not the case. It is a tiered system whereby people on the scheme would move down through the levels to 50% of their benefit, as well as retaining their jobs initiative funding. The family income supplement would then bring them up to a more reasonable level. In other words, the losses referred to would not occur. Changing one aspect in the Department would have huge consequences for other schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The disregard aspect could create an equity problem because people on other schemes do not have such a high disregard. The emphasis at the time was on encouraging lone parents, in particular, to go back to work and education, which is why the disregard was provided. Once the tier clicked in on the one-parent family allowance, it would automatically bring up the FIS. There would, therefore, still be the equity aspect. If one lost out on the lone parent allowance, one would be compensated through the family income supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">I had to decide whether to increase the disregard. However, on considering the consequences on other schemes, it did not appear the correct thing to do. My officials and I have had numerous discussions with FÁS. I would like to progress further the impact of other Departments and agencies on social welfare benefits, in particular. Even though we were providing an increase in the jobs initiative scheme, it had a negative effect on people who are dependent on my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">This provision does not satisfy everyone. As a result of our discussions, FÁS will be talking to the partnership groups – including the Tallaght partnership group. I have written to these groups and to my colleagues in the Dáil – I can also write to Members of this House – indicating how matters will be organised. It is not a perfect solution. Some people may lose between €5 and €10. They will retain the rent supplement, including scheme funding, medical cards or any other secondary benefits to which they are entitled. Family income supplement is not taken into consideration for many other secondary benefits. It is the best way to address this specific issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">We will have to take this issue into consideration when considering the thresholds. The cost in a full year of increasing the threshold would be in the region of €7 million, which I do not possess. I hope that supporting people by way of family income supplement will address their concerns. I will advise Senators how we propose to proceed. I have asked the Department to facilitate people in completing their application forms so that there will be no loss of income for those on the jobs initiative scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">The Senator referred to PRSI. With effect from the 2000-01 tax year, all employees covered under classes A, B, C, D, E and H, with reckonable earnings of not more than €287 per week, have been exempt from making an employee social insurance contribution. This was introduced under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. If the PRSI exemption threshold was increased to €290.40 per week to facilitate the 2,500 participants currently on the jobs initiative scheme, it would have to be introduced for all employees within the same earnings band. Obviously, the difference would be inequitable and it would discriminate against other categories of low paid workers. The most recent figures available indicate that to implement such a measure would affect approximately 21,300 employees and would cost in the region of €7.1 million in a full year. I have considered the matter and it is not proposed to adjust the threshold at this time. Participants in the jobs initiative scheme are affected by the application of the existing threshold in the same manner as other employees who, upon receiving an increase in reckonable earnings, may move from below the threshold to above it.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Class A employees with reckonable earnings of over €287 per week pay a social insurance contribution of 4% up to the employee earnings ceiling. We did not have an opportunity to increase the band this year and, therefore, many people on the jobs initiative scheme will not be exempt from paying social insurance. One can create poverty traps by setting ceilings but we must put a figure on disregards, including the stage at which people pay PRSI. We are not just dealing with those on the jobs initiative scheme, but with low paid workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept the Senator's amendments. I will try to address the concerns of people on the jobs initiative scheme through the family income supplement. I will advise Members on how the permutations will work. I will facilitate as quickly as possible people on the scheme in regard to their applications.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_133">I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply. On the lone parent allowance, the current maximum income for one parent families is €293. The €10 increase under the FÁS scheme, which would push people over the threshold, would mean that people would immediately lose 50%. There are 400 women nationwide in that category. Is the Minister suggesting that they can apply to her Department for FIS – I do not know whether people are aware that there is an ongoing debate about the supplement – and will that payment make up the difference of the 50% loss on the lone parent payment? This would involve their making separate applications. How is this to be communicated to what is a relatively small group of approximately 400 people?</p>
          <p eId="para_134">I understand the Minister's problem with the PRSI ceiling and the jobs initiative scheme. This is a focused scheme in that it only applies to those who have been out of work for a total of five years. It effectively covers those who have been unable to function in the labour market for many years. It provides them with the opportunity to return to work. The Minister implies that this year just over 21,000 employees will come into the net. Some are on low income and not participants in the scheme. This means that those taken into the net this year are new participants. By raising the ceiling, the Minister will not only help those on the scheme but also those on low income who, for the first time, will have to pay PRSI, an additional burden for them. I suspect most of them are not aware of this. I ask the Minister to consider making improvements in this area. While the amendment seeks to help those involved in the jobs initiative scheme, it will also help those on low income.</p>

Of these, 395 will benefit from the transitional arrangements available under the one parent family payment scheme. There will be a loss but it will not be of the kind envisaged by those not in receipt of family income supplement. Take the case of single parents with one child who are in receipt of the one parent family payment. In 2002 they would have earned €374.50 per week. This will be reduced to €362.95, a variation of approximately €11.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">"3.–The Minister shall, as soon as may be, after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a Report on the effects of abolishing the Back to Education Allowance for post graduate students and the implications of this decision concerning access to third level education."</p>
          <p eId="para_145">On Second Stage I implored the Minister to revoke section 3. The amendment calls on her to report to the Oireachtas on the effects of the decision to abolish the back-to-education allowance scheme. This is a cruel and crude cutback.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">On Second Stage the Minister indicated that a person with a primary degree had ample qualification for work. However, this fails to understand that many students returning to the education system do so in the belief they will be allowed to complete their studies. The vast majority of the courses in which they are involved necessitate continuing education. In most instances this will involve a postgraduate qualification. The author of this cutback failed to recognise this.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">It is petty in the extreme that the Department which held out incentives to return to education is now saying it is a luxury that can no longer be afforded. That is very regrettable. In 2002 there were 3,679 participants in the scheme, which is a credit to themselves and the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">The Department has also targeted the important incentive which allowed for a continuation of the allowance during the summer holidays. If this was carried to its conclusion, it would mean participants would also lose their allowance during other holiday periods such as Christmas and Easter. Why has the summer break been singled out?</p>
          <p eId="para_149">The Minister is acting in contradiction to the Minister for Education and Science. He is seeking to encourage the disadvantaged to participate in third level education and has cited this as a reason for the reintroduction of third level fees. It is illogical for the Minister to deny access to the disadvantaged at a time when her ministerial colleague is seeking to encourage it, although I do not agree with the reasons offered by the Minister for Education and Science for the reintroduction of third level fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The uncertainty in this area is a cause of concern to all parents and students. On Second Stage I referred to the example of a close friend of mine and neighbour. I outlined the reason, at the age of 14 years, he had dropped out of the education system. He was employed and lost his job but, with the encouragement of the Department and the then Minister, took the initiative and returned to education where he has flourished. Last week he told me he had done so to secure every possible qualification. Despite his achievements, he will lose because of this cutback. He is a father of eight children, six of whom are dependent on him, yet he will lose this allowance during the summer. The Minister said he could claim unemployment benefit or assistance. However, he wants to continue with his current allowance in order to complete his education.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">The important fact is that he started on that allowance. Now it has been ended and he is literally on the rocks. He is so despondent that he says there is no point in continuing and he will go and get a job. The job he will get will not be related to the years he has spent on the back to education scheme. I fail to understand the thinking behind the halting of this initiative. It will discourage the disadvantaged people we encouraged into it. The ending of this scheme shows callous disregard for their initiative and for disadvantaged people. I cannot emphasise that fact enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">I know the Minister's sympathy is with these people. If she considers the numbers of disadvantaged people attending courses in County Donegal, in the Sligo institute, the Galway-Mayo institute, NUIG and the third level institutes in Limerick, she will discover that the highest proportion of disadvantaged students participating in those schemes live in those areas. The Minister should immediately reverse the cruel decision that was made to halt this initiative because it affects the disadvantaged. She must allow these students to continue in their activities and must not disrupt their education. Many of those who now face imminent examinations cannot give of their best because of the uncertainty which is disrupting their studies and which is of great concern to them. They have lobbied every Member of the Houses because of the fear engendered in them by the abolition of this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">It is essential that the Minister make a positive statement that this allowance will be restored immediately in order to allay their fears. Some of them are in a state of despondency and have the attitude that they should quit now because they have been forgotten by the Government which has decided to discontinue the scheme. I plead with the Minister to indicate a positive response for the disadvantaged students involved.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_155">I regret this move by the Government and I hope the Minister will be in a position to reconsider it. The initiative was practical, worked and was of particular assistance to the disadvantaged. People on unemployment assistance, lone parents, people on farm assist schemes and blind people – the most vulnerable individuals in society – were taking up this opportunity. It is astonishing that this decision, which apparently – according to the voluminous correspondence I have received – was taken at Government level in January, has not yet been communicated to the people involved. This is confusing and worrying for these people as Senator Burke said. It is astonishing that people who are in the second year of their courses now find themselves in a situation where it is impossible for them to continue. That is regrettable and goes against the general trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I applaud the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, in his attempts to target the available resources. He is quite correct. I agree with that on university level also. I support him on this because he is a courageous Minister. I do not mind tough decisions if they focus resources towards the people who need them most. I would certainly be happy to support those decisions. I know it would not make me popular with my electorate, but I would do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The good thing about this scheme was that there was a standard rate of payment applying to all participants. It was positive in that it was not means tested, was payable for the whole course and included a book allowance. The provision of the book allowance was particularly positive because people often find it difficult to access money for books, but on this scheme students were not just paid their allowance and left stranded. The scheme was particularly intended to address the problem of low participation in the educational system by people from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">It is important for people to have access to higher degrees. The kind of academic qualifications I have would be damn all use in the open market and I am a senior lecturer. I threw my PhD out the window because I could not be bothered finishing it. I would probably be unemployable.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_160">Seriously, people need to look at the situation of having to go to third level. We have all received correspondence from people affected by this. I will not recite the lot, but I would like to place on record the case history of a mature student from Galway. I ask the House and the Minister and her officials to consider the practical implications of this. The letter I received states:</p>
          <p eId="para_161">In my case (a single BTEA student), my weekly allowance is €124.80 plus annual book allowance of €254. In addition to this I have a medical card and rent allowance. If I lose my BTEA benefit during the summer months, I automatically lose my rent allowance and medical card. I cannot cope with losing my rent allowance for the summer and furthermore when I return to college in September I will not be able to reclaim rent allowance as I have recently been informed that people paying rent over €65 per week cannot claim for rent allowance. I live in Galway City and I pay €85 a week, which is considered a fair rent. If I do try to find another cheaper place to rent I will face a long haul as most cheaper rooms do not accept rent allowance and are of substandard condition. I was only informed of this change this week and was never informed of the cut to my present rent allowance from €57.40 to €53.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">So, instead of trying to work for the summer and keep my benefits I have no choice but to return to the dole queue for the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">It is ironic that one of the reasons the BTEA scheme was initiated was to remove people from the dole queue. I make the point, through the direct case history to which I referred, that cutting the scheme will actually cost the Exchequer money. People will be dislodged from something positive, which would place them in a situation where they could contribute to the economy to a situation where they will be bored, depressed, feel useless and get stuck on a dole queue and the State will pay for it. There is not even a financial benefit in abolishing this scheme. I know we are in a period when there must be close monitoring of accounts, but the abolition of this scheme will have the opposite effect to that desired and will actually cost money overall. It may save money in one Department, but the debts will be transferred to another. Let us look at this matter in an honest manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">I will end with a bit of plámás. I am glad the Minister is in the House today because I know she is a decent, humane woman whose heart is in the right place. I know she will take the right decision if her wings have not been clipped by Cheltenham Charlie, as he was christened on the Order of Business this morning. I hope the Minister will be in a position to examine this matter, that she will take into account the facts laid before her today and consider the welfare of students on the scheme. The provision was generous and liberal, but we should not apologise for that. It is good that we should encourage people and give them a book allowance. It will be a real shame if this is taken away.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">I hope it will not be necessary to force this to a vote. I will not be in a position to take further part in the debate because I have some distinguished guests in the Visitors Gallery who represent a country that is friendly to Ireland. I will be available for the vote, if it comes to that but I hope it will not do so.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_168">The case for this amendment has been well put by Senators Burke and Norris. This is a crazy proposal. The Minister is a sensible, humane person who has her feet on the ground and knows the problem. This is a problem she can resolve. Will she state exactly the amount of money about which we are talking? The amount involved is small, but its loss will have a profound effect on the people who receive the allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">Those who make the transition to college at 18 or 19 years of age have every advantage. They leave secondary education and go to third level. Vast sums were spent on them before the introduction of free tuition fees. Four fifths of the total cost was paid by the State but now the total cost is paid. If one calculates how much the State pays for individuals, such as myself and others who went directly to college at 18 or 19 years of age, it is a massive investment. Some €100,000 is paid in direct subventions by the State to colleges for every student over a three or four year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The people about whom we are talking have taken the decision to go back to education. They are not looking for €100,000, €50,000 or €20,000 but for a small payment which will make a difference and enable them to remain in college and leave the education process better qualified and equipped to accept new jobs in the labour market. Anyone from any walk of life, irrespective of his or her qualifications, who takes a decision to go back to college is trodden on when it comes to getting the support to which he or she is entitled. He or she is constantly under the cosh when it comes to making financial payments to colleges for books or maintenance payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">People at 18 or 19 years of age have it quite good because the State pays their way. If their parents' income is below a certain level, they will get a maintenance payment. They will be able to get a job in the labour market at 21 or 22 years of age. However, those who leave work to go back to college on a full-time basis are not supported, which is ludicrous. The investment I got as a student when I started college at 18 or 19 years of age was mammoth compared to the small sums people in their thirties or forties who want to go back to college are looking for.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">There is cross-party support for this amendment. I congratulate those who made representations, particularly the lobby group from NUI Galway where I know the issue has greater significance than in other colleges. I ask the Minister to reconsider, even at this late stage, and do something significant for the people concerned who find themselves in this situation. Otherwise, we will send out all the wrong signals. It seems we will come down heavy on those from disadvantaged backgrounds who want to make a difference to their education and have shown huge initiative by going back to college at a difficult age. That is unacceptable in this day and age. I request the Minister's support for this amendment.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_173">This seems to be another case of a lack of co-ordination between Departments. Other Senators have pointed out that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is encouraging people to go back to education in order they can be usefully employed in the highly technical areas we want to promote, yet the Department of Social and Family Affairs is severely cutting the back-to-education allowance. This will affect women particularly badly. The Minister is aware of my involvement with Cherish, the single mothers organisation, because she kindly opened a large conference we organised last year. The back-to-education allowance has been extraordinarily important for the young women concerned. This will be a serious setback for many of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">I am involved in the trust fund in Trinity College and we try, with our limited funds, to help students with financial difficulties, one of the major reasons they drop out of education. It is hard, as other Senators have pointed out, to see students who may be in second year wondering how they will complete their degree. More will call on us if this unfortunate cut is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I want to tell the Minister something she may not have heard. I know I am speaking to a discreet audience. Such decisions can be reversed. We had trouble last autumn because there was a postgraduate course in Trinity College for clinical psychologists, of which there is a ghastly shortage. Only approximately 50% of those needed are available and there has been a worldwide search to get them. It was decided by the Department of Education and Science that it would run a course for 20 postgraduates in clinical psychology. There must be posts in the health service and the course was organised by the Department of Health and Children with the North Western Area Health Board of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. However, two weeks before it was due to start and with those who were to teach the course in place and being paid, the Department of Health and Children decided it would not employ the postgraduate students, many of whom had given up jobs to do the course. I am delighted that all hell was raised by me and others and we managed to get the decision reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">This, therefore, is a decision the Minister can reverse. She could say she had terrible trouble in the Seanad and that she was told this was a serious mistake. It is not a huge fund or a staggering amount. As has been pointed out, many of the people concerned will draw unemployment money instead. I appeal to the Minister to say this is one decision she wants reversed. It has happened before and can happen again.</p>

This cutback will affect the worst-off in our society. Those on low incomes are already marginalised by the system. This scheme was intended to eliminate social exclusion. The savings made by the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be cancelled out by the fact that some will find themselves back in the dole queue. This cutback is regressive and harsh. The Minister must make a case to the Department of Finance for funding for such schemes. It must be next to impossible for a Minister to negotiate with Cheltenham Charlie to obtain funding for a worthwhile and deserving scheme. I appeal to the Minister to use her better judgment, good nature and reasonable thinking acumen to plead with the Department of Finance and accept this amendment.</p>

Anyone listening to the debate might think it was being abolished, which is not the case.

The issue of equity must be looked at. If the scheme were to be continued for the summer the resources deployed in that area would have to be taken from other areas. In that context I am not sure the arguments made are as strong as the emotional sense behind them appears.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">I am not taking for granted the sincerity of the views expressed but it is important to go back to the beginning and see why the schemes were set up in 1996 and 1997. The entire ethos of the scheme was to encourage people back into education and to give them the opportunity of second chance education. The scheme is not gone. That interpretation could be taken from the debate here. What has happened is that two changes have been made. I refute the argument that people were not made aware of the changes, given that they were issued in a press release in November 2002. The two changes refer to postgraduates and payments in the summer. Those already in the scheme are not affected by the changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The reason people are encouraged into second chance education is to improve their job prospects. Initially, job prospects can be improved if people have a second level qualification, such as a leaving certificate, and a primary degree. It then progresses to a masters or a PhD. There are very few people who have gone through the system as we did who would not have had a job prospect by having a primary degree. Those with a primary degree have access to the jobs market. At many of the courses people are encouraged to go out to work and, if necessary, to get additional qualifications, such as a masters, PhD or whatever. Some go through the entire streamline of academia.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">At present 600 people on the back to education scheme are doing postgraduate courses. In the context of the economic climate, choices have to be made in reviewing any of the schemes. I agree with many of the arguments made by Senators. If I take the €3 million which is needed and put it back into the scheme I have to take that €3 million from somebody else. Nobody has suggested any bright ideas as to where I can find €3 million in my budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">—that if I put the €3 million back into the postgraduate scheme I will be able to counterbalance it by taking it from somewhere else. There were choices to be made and I had to make them. The independent Estimates review committee evaluated the schemes and recommended that people should not be paid during the summer. This applies to the participants who were in receipt of unemployment payments prior to participation in the scheme. All other participants – for example, lone parents, people with disabilities – remain unaffected by this decision and will retain payment during the summer period.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">What has happened is that people have been given the allowance on a weekly basis and in the main they were also working during the summer. That payment is not means tested. It has been decided that those who are unable to find work, and sometimes it is quite difficult to find summer work, will be paid by the Department. I appreciate the argument made by Senator Norris because it is just another section of my Department which will pay those people during the summer. Everything in life is not simple, and particularly in my Department. Somebody once said, "If I were starting again I would not start from here."  The schemes have been added to and we have tweaked schemes to address concerns. Naturally there are knock-on effects in other sections of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I appreciate what has been said. I have been lobbied by the members of the Union of Students in Ireland, by Members of both Houses and the universities. At a time of economic constraints, second chance education, be it at second level or at primary degree level, should be seen as a stepping stone, the pathway to progression into the jobs market.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">I will keep the issue under review. At present I am not in a position to tell Senators that I can change the scheme. If Senators can find €3 million for the scheme and a further €15 million or €16 million for another scheme I will be delighted to listen to them.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_211">The Minister has firmly slammed the door on the many people seeking to return to education. The Department has failed – I do not believe the Minister is that way inclined – to address the problems faced by those who re-enter the education system. Many of them, aged 21 years plus, having dropped out of education for various reasons, are going through hell on earth trying to fit in with their peers on various courses and do so very successfully as I outlined to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The Minister has said we must prioritise in the moneys available and that she has done this, yet she does not see this disadvantaged group as a priority. I am baffled and saddened by this. Returning to education is a huge leap for the many hoping to get a qualification which will provide them with an opportunity to obtain gainful employment in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Many are unsure of their position. I have instanced the case to the Minister of a man, two years into his course, who must now make a decision on whether to continue and do his degree and perhaps a postgraduate course later. The Minister said such people were not affected but they are. The abolition of the scheme has unsettled this man and his peer group at a time when they are due to take examinations. Unsettling students on the eve of an examination has a traumatic affect on them. I gave the Minister one example in that regard and there are many others. The man who came to me was deeply concerned about having to return to the social welfare scene. One might say he is still in it but the circumstances are different. He has received enormous support from his family over the last two years and has no other means of supporting his six dependent children.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The Minister asked where in her Department she would find the €3 million required. There is wasteful expenditure in the Department. Why was it necessary for it to rent part of a hotel for field officers reviewing social welfare recipients? The town in question has two social welfare offices which would have adequately accommodated the holding of interviews, yet the Department felt it necessary to rent accommodation at a four star hotel. I referred to this last night in the context of the lack of privacy afforded to those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The Department sends out a great deal of promotional literature each year. Is the Minister saying she cannot make a €3 million saving in that area? We have already spoken about the photograph opportunities and consultancies. Where there is a will, there is a way. The author of this idea must be asked to return to reality and not allow the disadvantaged to suffer as a consequence of this cut. It is absolutely necessary that the Minister requests heads of sections in her Department to search for the €3 million required to support the 600 postgraduate students involved. It is not an impossible task. We would have a problem if we needed €30 million per annum but we are talking only about €3 million. The downside, whether the Minister accepts it, is that from here on people will see this as the thin end of the wedge. She has said this does not mean the end of the scheme but not many will be convinced. People will not participate if there is uncertainty. They will fear that what is available today will not be available tomorrow. We are dealing with one of the most disadvantaged groups in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Many Senators, including Senator Norris, referred to the contradictory message being sent by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, regarding the introduction of fees to allow, specifically, access to education by the disadvantaged. What is the Minister for Social and Family Affairs doing? She has been used as a pawn on this issue. I hope she will give an indication that her Department will find the resources necessary to allow the continuation of this very satisfactory and worthwhile scheme. While it is not under threat, even those considering availing of it will have doubts. Many already participating in it have doubts. The scheme will become less attractive, which is a shame, particularly as it affects the disadvantaged, those who were back on the path to re-establishing themselves in the interests not of their ego but of bettering themselves. Many of those involved were denied work opportunities for various reasons. They have since made a special effort to re-establish themselves and the Minister is now taking that away from them. That is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I hope we will not have to put the amendment to a vote and that the Minister will give a positive response and provide a glimmer of hope to those involved in what is a catch-22.</p>

While the Minister puts to the House the idea that this is a small, incidental change that will not make any difference, it will make a huge difference.

          <p eId="para_249">I do, I believe in attainment. However, I also believe a number of schemes that started off as very good ideas have lost the basis for their initiation. This has happened to many schemes because we have added to them during the years. There was a need for some schemes, such as this one, but there is not necessarily a need for all schemes. The philosophy behind the creation of some schemes has been lost.</p>

          <p eId="para_273">"3.–The Minister shall, as soon as may be, after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report:</p>
          <p eId="para_274">(<i>a</i>) contrasting the increase in 2002 of the Consumer Price Index with the increases paid to the entitled persons under the Act of 2002;</p>
          <p eId="para_275">(<i>b</i>) evaluating the suitability and appropriateness of the items and weightings used by the Central Statistics Office in computing the rates of increase in the Consumer Price Index to the needs of the principal categories of entitled persons under the Principal Act;</p>
          <p eId="para_276">(<i>c</i>) setting out the Department's assessment of those groups potentially most seriously affected by significant inflationary pressures which may arise because of internal and external factors in 2003.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">We have about 45 minutes left in which to deal with the Bill, so we will probably make progress. As the Minister is probably aware, this is a long-standing amendment that has been tabled in respect of every Social Welfare Bill while I have been a Member. I am sure she has been advised that it cannot be accepted. Its objective is to ensure that the increases provided for in the Social Welfare Bill each year are indexed in respect of inflation. This year, the increases were in the region of €6 to €11. The increases already made, which bring themselves to bear on a range of services and goods, are such that it is difficult for those who have received them to make ends meet. Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 attempt to introduce an indexing section in the Bill that will allow us to see at regular intervals how the increases are holding in respect of the groups that have received them at the end of December and in early January. This makes absolute sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Inflation is posing a problem. As I said on Second Stage, any junior economist could tell one that the first people affected by inflation are those on fixed incomes because they have no way of amending those incomes to account for the increased prices of many goods and services. Hyper-inflation affects poorer people more than any other group in the economy. The Minister should acknowledge that there is a need to accept my amendment. If I am ever in her place, I might accept such an amendment.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_281">I can see why this amendment is a hardy annual in discussions on the Social Welfare Bill. Heretofore, the rate of the increases has been well above that of inflation. Annual inflation is at 4.8%. The minimum rate increase is above that and takes inflation into consideration. I appreciate that there have been increases in some household expenditure but there have been reductions in many other essentials such as clothing and footwear.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">It has been a key objective in all the Social Welfare Acts to protect and enhance the value of all rates of payment in relative terms. Further reports and analyses are not warranted. The consumer price index makes available to the public and my own Department the information requested. We also work closely with the ESRI and with the Combat Poverty Agency which analyses the impact of social welfare rates after each budget. Voluntary organisations do likewise. Even if inflation exceeded the budget projection of 4.8 per cent for this year, actual inflation to date will be fully taken into account when we consider revision of the rates for next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">We are working on averages. Not all economists will agree, but we are going on a 4.8% inflation figure, and the social welfare rates increases have allowed for this, and for the necessities of people when unfortunately they find themselves dependent on my Department. Social welfare increases over the past years have well exceeded inflation, and many of this year's rates also exceed the projected inflation rate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_284">In reply to Senator's Brady question as to why we cannot accept the information on inflation in good faith, since we get it from the consumer price index, that is hardly the point. If, in legislation, there is an effective mechanism for reporting to both Houses, it means that something will result from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Three years ago the annual increase given to social welfare recipients was only 50% of the inflation level applying to the general cost of living at that time. There was massive inflation over a six-month period. I understand that the argument was made at the Cabinet table by the then Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that he needed more funding for his Department to ensure that people's basic standard of living could be sustained for that six-month period. A provision in the Bill for a reporting mechanism to both Houses would ensure we could put pressure on the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues to find more money. That is the objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The Minister said to the House that prices of clothing and footwear have come down. She should point out the shops where this is so, to me and to those on small incomes. I do not know what shops she is referring to. Charges have risen for electricity, gas, transport and television licences. All the basic price indicators for people on low incomes are heading in the wrong direction. I put it to the Minister that at the end of this year, the increases provided in the budget will not have compensated people for the inflationary pressures in our economy. The data shows that inflation is heading sky-high. That will continue over the next six months.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">Yes, and I would be a recipient from my own Department when finished. Many items have increased in price and others have decreased. The information made available through the household budget survey and through the CPI has indicated that prices of essential clothing and footwear have declined over the past year by 7.8%. Likewise, the costs of furnishings, household equipment and routine household maintenance have fallen by 0.4%.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">If we recall what was said in the other House, and no doubt reiterated in this House, the Minister for Finance indicated that the average inflation rate would be 4.8%, and he also indicated that at times during the year it would increase, but would level out at 4.8%. Certain considerations lie outside our control – such as war and its influence on markets. We cannot know what effects these will have, but I am happy that the social welfare rates provided will address the issue of inflation.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">"3.–The Minister shall, as soon as may be, after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on promises made by Government in An Agreed Programme for Government and the national anti-poverty strategy, the average annual increase in payments which would be required to meet the NAPS promises by 2007, and whether in any case this level of increase will be met in 2003, and if not what proposals, if any, are envisaged to phase in the increases required."</p>
          <p eId="para_297">This amendment deals with the failure by the Government to deal with national anti-poverty strategy promises. A paper submitted to the tax strategy group by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs sets out promises made by the Government in An Agreed Programme for Government and in the national anti-poverty strategy. The Government then calculated what increases in social welfare rates would be required to meet these commitments. To meet the NAPS target, the lowest rate of social welfare should have been increased by €10.10 to make it €15.40. To meet a PPF commitment, an increase of €8.70 would have been required, and an increase of €6 was granted. To meet the old age pension commitments, an increase of €13.20 weekly was required; only €10 was granted. The Government also campaigned on a promise to increase child benefit by €31.59 monthly; instead it delivered €8. The commitments in the programme for Government and the NAPS were to be achieved by 2007 and the argument could be made by the Government that there is time to catch up. The figures I have given represent an abject failure.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">I support Senator McCarthy's amendments. I said in the House last night that there was cross-party support for the revised national anti-poverty strategy when it was published just before the last general election. The targets for 2007 are about right, and I encourage all concerned to meet them. We are in the first year of trying to attain those 2007 targets, which, it states in the agreement, must be achieved earlier should financial circumstances permit.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The problem is that the social welfare increases that the Government announced in the budget mean it will not even come close to realising the targets by 2007. That sends out a very negative signal to those on extremely poor incomes. In the Minister's first year trying to attain that target we have seen a failure in her Department. If the national anti-poverty strategy is to be taken as a real Government commitment, we will have to do much better next year in ratcheting up the basic increases given to people who have to live, as the Minister well knows, on extremely small incomes.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">I certainly take into consideration the Senator's view on the national anti-poverty strategy. The strategy has been very comprehensive, and most people, be they elected representatives or pillars of the community, have accepted it. A review of the strategy is now taking place, and will go before the European Commission by July 2003. That will afford an opportunity to me and anyone else interested to review the targets set. Those targets are, as Senator McCarthy has rightly said, to be met in 2007. I cannot therefore achieve them all in one year. It is like a game of football, where the first kick of the ball does not mean that you will win the game. You must wait until the end.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">No, you try to avoid those if at all possible. We will not get into football, for Cork is doing quite well in the league at the moment, and Donegal is not doing particularly well anywhere. We are going to be relegated, so we will skip that analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The review of the strategy will certainly be very helpful to us all when we examine what targets are to be set. The strategy covers not only social welfare but many other services, something which gives a more comprehensive view of how we can tackle the issues. I would certainly like, as I am sure would all the elected representatives in both Houses, to be able to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty. We must work towards that. We are making progress towards fulfilling those commitments, particularly that concerning old age pensions. The €10 increase will achieve our goal in the programme for Government, as well as attaining part of the national anti-poverty strategy. I certainly see us achieving our aims in that strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Recently I have had the social inclusion office set up in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Its director will be co-ordinating the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy and pushing other Departments as well as my own to achieve the goals that we have set ourselves. There is no need for another review or report on the issue, for we will have that in July 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">It is very important that I dispel the misconceptions about the tax strategy group, which has reviewed how social welfare payments should be realised in the five-year period to 2007. However, the Senator forgot to say that it was a matter for the Government rather than the group. All the group did was cost the overall commitment. It did not recommend to the Government what should be achieved. There is a misconception abroad that we have rejected something when it was never recommended in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I intend over the next five years of the Government that we shall do our utmost to achieve the targets set for 2007, which we have discussed here on numerous occasions and with which we are very familiar. We will have the opportunity to re-evaluate the achievement of those targets in the course of the current review.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_308">I prefaced my contribution by saying that the Government could argue, probably justifiably in some cases, that the targets could be met between now and 2007. However, we should remember what was set out in the document that we mentioned. The figures were achievable and realistic, but they were not met. My point concerned the commitment to meet targets that were realistic and achievable. That has not been done. There was an abject failure by the Government to fulfil that commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">In the light of what the Minister has said, it would be appropriate to ask her for a statement on how the increases will be phased in over the period in question. She has made the point, as I predicted, that she could meet the targets between now and 2007. If that is to be so, can we have a statement explaining how those increases will be phased over the next four years?</p>

          <p eId="para_322">There is a very simple answer to that question; it is a demographic issue. In many European countries there is higher GDP expenditure on social protection because they have a greater number of elderly persons than we do at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">In the seven year period, 1990 to 1996, EU social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP rose on average by 2.9% from 25.5% to 28.4% as a result of the lower rate of economic growth and rising unemployment during the period. Four years on, the percentage had declined slightly to 27.3% due to renewed economic growth and an actual decline in social protection expenditure in some countries in the European Union, some of which would have been attributed to the decline in unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">In Ireland, in the same seven year period, 1990 to 1996, expenditure on social protection as a percentage of GDP fell slightly from 18.4% to 17.8%. By the year 2000 the figure had fallen further to 14.1%, reflecting unprecedented levels of economic growth and job creation. Annual rates of growth ranged from 8% to 11% in the period 1994 to 2000 while levels of unemployment declined from 14.3% to less than 4%. Although there was a percentage decrease in social protection expenditure in relation to GDP, there was no reduction in the level of actual social protection expenditure during this period but rather a substantial increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">EUROSTAT figures show a 21.4% increase in <i>per capita</i> expenditure on social protection in the period 1995 to 2000 compared to the EU average of 8.7%. Over the longer period 1990 to 1999 there was an increase of 50% in real terms compared to the EU average of 24%. This is reflected in the 62.5% increase in expenditure on sickness benefit and the 74.6% increase on invalidity and disability benefit and the 39.3% increase on old age benefits between 1995 and 2000.</p>

The main areas of social protection in the European Union focus on old age which is not necessarily the case in Ireland. I appreciate the point made by the Senator. We have a different welfare system compared to that in many other EU countries.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">"5.–The Minister shall, as soon as may be, after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report indicating the likely number of persons who would benefit if the carer's allowance was extended in whole or in part to persons already in receipt of payments under the Principal Act.".</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I will be brief because there is a considerable time constraint. There are approximately 20,000 persons in receipt of carer's allowance but that number could easily be extended to 130,000 when those caring for people with disabilities are included. I wish to bring to the Minister's attention an anomaly that has arisen.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">There is a regulation which states a person cannot work more than ten hours and receive carer's allowance. I am aware of three instances where farmers looking after 85 and 90 year old relatives have been disqualified on the basis that they are deemed to be working more than ten hours. Up to now the Department has operated with a degree of cop-on and discretion in relation to this regulation. However, there is now rigid implementation of the rule. If a person is deemed to be working more than one hour and 20 minutes each day outside the home, he or she cannot qualify for the allowance. I know people who are managing to combine both. They help their relative to get up in the morning, give them breakfast, check on them during the day, prepare lunch and an evening meal and settle them in bed for the night. They are now being disqualified. The alternative is to put the elderly or incapacitated person into a home at a cost of €400 to €500 per week. This is daft and absurd and gives the impression of being uncaring. It makes no sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I ask the Minister to examine the manner in which the regulation is being implemented. There are hundreds receiving the allowance on the assumption they can accommodate all duties. One can check on a relative nine or ten times a day and give them the care to which they are entitled while doing a diminished amount of farm work. As the Minister will be aware of such cases in her constituency, I ask her to reconsider the issue and revert to the old regime in terms of interpretation.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_341">In page 13, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_342">1.–In respect of the year of assessment 2003 and subsequent years of assessment, section 461 of the Principal Act is amended by substituting ‘€2,000' for ‘€1,250'.".</p>
          <p eId="para_343">I did not move recommendations Nos. 1 and 2 because the intended effect of all four recommendations is to remove the minimum wage from the income tax net. The first two recommendations, duplicates of amendments that appeared on the Dáil Order Paper on Report Stage, propose to achieve this by way of extending the exemption limits. I am not disposed to that approach and the Minister will be aware of my views. I have opted for a different approach, set out in recommendations Nos. 3 and 4, which would increase personal tax credits for single and married persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">For some time I have taken the view that income tax was reduced too quickly and in the wrong way. As I have debated this on numerous occasions with the Minister, I see little point in detaining the House by rehearsing the argument. However, both he and I agree that, in principle, a way should be found to remove the minimum wage from the income tax net.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The minimum wage is €6.70 per hour. Assuming the new partnership programme, Sustaining Progress, is passed and agreed, it will increase to €7 per hour next year. This will mean that the percentage of the minimum wage exempt from the tax net will fall from its current level of approximately 90% to under 80% by the end of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The principle is simple. If the Oireachtas takes the view that employers should not be allowed to pay employees less than a certain figure –€6.70 per hour – it follows that part of that money should not be taken by the State in the form of income tax. If the State holds that €6.70 per hour is the least that people should be asked to work for, it should not take any of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">The way to achieve this is by increasing personal tax credits. I accept the Minister's argument that increasing the employee tax credit to a reasonable level is another approach, although I would not fully pursue that route. Personal tax credits should be increased in accordance with the minimum wage on an annual basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">Senator McDowell has acknowledged that there is no difference in objective in terms of removing those on the minimum wage from the tax net. It is a priority in the new partnership agreement. The only question is how quickly it can be done. Tax levels on those on low incomes compare favourably with those pertaining in other European Union countries, although that is not an argument for not moving as quickly as possible in the direction outlined by the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I understand the Minister has managed to keep the threshold of the minimum income removed from the tax net at 90%. The budget this year is very tight. There is also the need to fund essential services, for which Senator McDowell and the rest of us argue every day. In all the circumstances, the Minister has done the best he can on this occasion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_350">I support the thrust of the recommendation. While the minimum wage has increased from its initial level, it continues to be sparse and parsimonious. A person on the minimum wage is on a minimum standard of living and effectively on the breadline.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">From the point of view of saying that we compare well with other jurisdictions that argument might be valid. At the same time, as a result of the returns the Minister is claiming, despite the initial bad prognosis in regard to Revenue, surely he is now in a position to accede to this amendment and to give relief to people on the lower income scale who are barely able to survive. Admittedly their standard of living is somewhat guaranteed by a statutory minimum wage, but at the same time they are struggling hard to keep body and soul together and to maintain a reasonably decent minimum standard of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I fully support this amendment. The Minister should reflect on his attitude, as expressed on Committee Stage in the other House, and accept it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_199">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_353">Recommendations Nos. 3 and 4 propose to increase the basic personal tax credits from €1,520 to €2,000 for single persons and from €3,040 to €4,000 for married persons. The cost of the increase proposed by the Senator, taking account of the consequential increase in the one-parent family tax credits, would be €557 million in 2003 and €777 million in the full year. This cost represents more than four times the full year costs of the 2003 budget income tax package and would not be possible in the current economic circumstances. I have already indicated to Senators, or will indicate to them, the other reasons I cannot accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">In this year's budget I have made only a limited number of changes to the personal tax system. These will have a total cost of €186 million in a full year. That is all that can be afforded in the current economic circumstances. When the resources were there we made the corresponding improvements, as the following facts will confirm. The value of the personal credit increased by almost 16% in the period from 2000 to end-2002 while the value of the PAYE credit, or allowance as it was then, increased by over 136% in the same period. The value of the standard rate bands for a single person increased by over 29% over the same period, while the exemption limits for those aged 65 and over increased by over 57%. By comparison, in the same two-year period the consumer price index rose by less than 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">If the Senators wish to examine the issue going back as far as 1997 they will see that, in terms of income relieved of tax for the standard rate taxpayer, the combined value of the personal credit and the PAYE credit, or allowances as they were then, has increased by over 78% up to the end of 2002. Over the same period the consumer price index increased by about 22%. In 1997, before the Government came into office, a single person with an income above €17,207, or as it was then £13,600, which was lower than the average industrial wage, became liable for the top tax rate. Currently the standard rate band for a single person stands at €28,000 per annum, higher than the average industrial wage. Over the period since 1997, the average tax rate of a single person on the average industrial wage has dropped by over ten percentage points or well over 27% to 17% today. These are the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The Government is committed to sustaining economic growth, strengthening and maintaining the competitive position of the economy and maintaining full employment. Responsible fiscal policies are central to the achievment of these aims and the proposal, as outlined by the Senators, would be inconsistent with this approach. Therefore I cannot accept the recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Senator McDowell, having marked me in the Dáil for five years, knows we have gone over this ground on many previous occasions. I am well aware of his views on this matter, as he is of mine. Although Senator Higgins was a Member of the Dáil he may not be as aware of my views because he was a spokesperson in another area.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">As surveys throughout Europe have shown, and it has also been heralded in the media, the lower paid Irish worker has a better deal than anyone else in the European Union in terms of tax and insurance contributions taken from his wage. We are streets ahead of all the other European countries. A recent OECD survey has shown that not alone are we better than Europe but we are better than most countries worldwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">People laugh now and say that my budgets favour the rich. The opposite is true. My greatest press supporter, <i>The Irish Times, </i>stated in an article that in Charlie McCreevy's time as Minister for Finance the case could be made that he overdid the concessions towards the lower paid <i>vis-à-vis </i>other categories. We have come from up the tree to the bottom of the tree. That has been possible because of our economic success. My view is that taxation plays a major part as a driver of economic performance. That is a fundamental principle of mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">In this budget, due to economic circumstances, it was only possible to do a little. I considered doing nothing on taxation in the budget at one stage. What we did do was to keep 90% of the minimum wage out of the tax net. We did it by this particular method, with which I feel Senator McDowell would agree, rather than the exemption limit method which his colleagues in the other House put forward. I know he would be opposed to that method because of its obvious traps which I have practically eliminated. There are few taxpayers now caught at the marginal rate – only people aged over 65. That improvement was recommended by many groups and we have succeeded with it. We have different ways of doing things but both of us would agree that the other way was not the better way.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I am often amused, and Senator Mansergh will recall this because he acted in another capacity in my political party at the time, in regard to the minimum wage. The idea of the minimum wage, which has been regarded as quite revolutionary and socially progressive, was announced by the Fianna Fáil Party about six to nine months before the general election of 1997. The person who advocated and announced the idea as our policy was none other than myself. This well-known, right wing Thatcherite ideologue was the person who foisted this on the Fianna Fáil Party. Funnily enough, the then rainbow Government was not in a position to respond. It agreed it was a good idea but believed it would not be possible and it was not incorporated in its election manifesto. The rainbow Government, led by Deputy John Bruton, and former Deputies Spring and Proinsias De Rossa did not include it as part of their manifesto because they thought it could not be done. It was I who announced it as part of Fianna Fáil policy because it was my idea, a fact which will upset those on the left.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">When we came into power we set up the minimum wage commission which reported in due time. We then had the job of implementing it, which comes under the remit of the Tánaiste. There was nothing in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto regarding taking the minimum wage out of the tax net because there was no minimum wage at the time. When we reviewed the programme for Government in 1999, and I think Senator Mansergh was part of the review group, we made it one of our goals to remove people on the minimum wage from the tax net. That spilled over into, and became a goal of, the PPF. If one looked at the Fianna Fáil election manifesto of 1997, about which Senator Mansergh would know a lot, one would not see any reference to this in the taxation area because it only became a goal subsequently for us, the Progressive Democrats and the social partners. I explain for the benefit of the historical record.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_363">I have been over this territory many times and am not sure I have the energy to do so again but I will try. Shortly after the 1997 election the removal of the minimum wage from the tax net did become part of Government policy. It was restated in the programme for the millennium and restated again last year as Fianna Fáil policy. It is again in the draft of the Sustaining Progress programme which is currently being considered by the social partners. It is now long established Government policy to take the minimum wage out of the income tax net. That is for good sound solid reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I do not have the Minister's fixation with tax rates. It would not disturb me to increase the tax credits and to have to find some compensatory method, within the tax system, of paying for that. I acknowledge that things this year are tighter and that there is not scope for net reductions in income tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">I am not as upset as Members were in the other House, if my reading of the debate is accurate, about the failure to index. I understand the reasons for that. However, it should have been done several years ago because it would have been easier to maintain. We must now move to take the minimum wage out of the income tax net.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I accept some of what the Minister said about the Government's treatment of lower paid workers. He did not front load it because it did happen, although it was primarily as a result of the introduction of tax credits. Nonetheless, I give praise for that. It was a worthwhile and progressive move which will stand to us in the future. I suspect the Minister agrees with me that there is a case for virtually everyone who works to make a social contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_368">That should be done through the social contribution or PRSI system rather than the taxation system. I feel the freedom to say in this House that it would not trouble me if, for example, we looked at the exemption from PRSI or at the €100 threshold in PRSI. However, we should not take income tax from people on the minimum wage. That is the purpose of the recommendations.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">As someone who, as the Minister said, worked in another capacity in Fianna Fáil, I enjoyed the visit down memory lane. It is one of the progressive measures in which I share a collective pride. I remember that during the general election campaign in 1997 the then Labour leader, Mr. Dick Spring, was dubious about the proposition, as the Labour Party was about social partnership ten years previously. Without giving too much of a party political broadcast, there have been many occasions when such progressive and radical measures – I add tax credits to that in the middle of the last Administration – have put us at the cutting edge of progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Those involved in Sustaining Progress are not just the Government, but the trade unions and many who belong to the community and voluntary sector. Sustaining Progress states that to the extent that there is any scope for personal tax reduction, progress will continue to be made over the three budgets contained within the lifetime of this agreement towards removing those on the minimum wage from the tax net and also the 80%. That is a realistic recognition of the sums the Minister mentioned. It could not have been done before this agreement was negotiated. It is probably unrealistic to expect it to be done in one attempt in the future.</p>

It stated that whenever resources were available, any scope for taxation cuts would be concentrated on the lower paid. We said the least of all the parties about personal taxation. Senator Higgins's party promised intermediate cuts in tax rates and the devil and all, but we promised zero. I am sure someone can get me a copy of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.

Everybody should make a little contribution to the State. There should be a mythical box in a computer which shows Joe Smith's contribution during his working life. It might only be 1 cent per week during the times he has worked. I agree with the Senator. It does not mean we would take it through the taxation system. It would probably be done through the PRSI or social insurance system. I also believe in that principle. Senator McDowell heard me speak about that in the other House.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Everything in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government agreement and the partnership programmes, including Sustaining Progress, is conditional on sustainable public finances.

In regard to the Freedom of Information Bill, I cannot recall how it got enmeshed into the actual debate. The Minister made the point that there should be nothing for nothing. For any service provided a minimal or a nominal contribution should be paid from the point of view of respect for that service.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">In regard to the point made by Senator McDowell that instead of doing it by means of taxation contributions from those on the minimum wage it might be more appropriate to do it through the social insurance scheme. In other words, the contribution would find its way into the system by way of the social insurance scheme. After all, these people are on the minimum wage. The social insurance scheme would meet both requirements in that it would bring a certain amount of money into the Exchequer while maintaining it at a reasonable level.</p>

          <p eId="para_392">In this area of taxation, Sustaining Progress, states:</p>
          <p eId="para_393">To the extent that there is any scope for personal tax reductions, progress will continue to be made over the three budgets contained within the lifetime of this Agreement towards removing those on the minimum wage from the tax net, moving towards the target where 80% of all earners pay tax at not more than the standard rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">That is what we have agreed to. The Department and I were involved in this wording, which was agreed. That should clear up the point for Senator McDowell.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">There are many ways in which we can ensure that everyone makes a small contribution to the PRSI system. I do not want to commit myself to it now because it depends very much on economic circumstances. The Senator will know that I regarded reform of the PRSI system as an integral part of reform of the taxation system and I had intended, probably in the budget which has gone through, if circumstances had permitted, that it would be my final goal over a budget or two to reform the PRSI and levy system which is badly in need of reform. Due to economic circumstances the budgetary situation did not allow me to make any significant changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I had worked on many ideas and had them available to spring on my unsuspecting colleagues in the Department of Finance. My colleagues were not that unsuspecting because they had been working on them as well as I had given them notice of what I was going to do over a period. Unfortunately I was unable to do it in the last budget. It is still one of my goals. Their is no point in reforming the tax credit system without reforming the PRSI system also.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I happen to believe fundamentally in the insurance principle for workers. This will shock and appal all the people on the left. Many of those in my party, in Fine Gael and in the Progressive Democrats do not agree the tax and PRSI systems should be merged. I have always believed in this principle as strongly as any trade unionist. There should be some little dot in a box to say that Joe Smith contributed so much during his lifetime, even though he was at the lower end and unemployed for some time.</p>

I got the Department of Finance to go back over how much money we had provided to the social insurance fund since 1951 or 1952 as the case may be and it owes us billions if a reasonable rate of interest is added. It would take a long time to get €600 million odd every year and to get back the amount the Exchequer has transferred to the social insurance fund. I regard the €635 million as a small repayment of what the social insurance fund owed the Exchequer.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">It is commonly accepted that there are two elements in the social insurance fund: the social solidarity principle and the contributory principle. Both are equally valid. I am willing to accept what the Minister has said at face value, but it is difficult to marry it with the notion that as soon as the fund gets into surplus he takes some out to balance his budget elsewhere, which is precisely what he did. That does not stand up in principle. I am surprised to hear the Minister attempt to argue it in principle. It was simply a pragmatic effort on his part to try to balance the books in a difficult year.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Irrespective of the social partners – perhaps Senator O'Toole knows more about it than I do – I am sorry we did not find out what the Minister had intended to do in the last budget. Clearly this is an area where there can be some movement in the next five years. If the Minister does not get the Freedom of Information Amendment Bill through the other House in time he might find out that I had intended to it but it never got into our manifesto either. Perhaps one of the reasons the Minister did not do it last year is that it is difficult to do it without losers.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">In the PPF there was also a condition that economic growth would be of the order of 5.5% on average. There was a row over whether it had to be 5.5% per year or 5.5% on average. I argued it was 5.5% on average while he argued it was 5.5% per year. The nature of these things is such that one learns to change the words the next time around. On the question of priority there was a concession on our part, which I did not like making, that it be subject to economic development and growth. The real issue would be the order of priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I tend to be optimistic in terms of the economy and on the question of inflation. It would be good to have it on the record that the issue of the minimum wage would be at the top of the Government agenda.

That was an agreement that came about voluntarily between the Government and the social partners. When it set up the process and reported, some of the critics expected the Government to say it would walk away from the deal. Part of the PPF was that we would set up this agreement. If the Government were to walk away at that stage we would never again get an agreement with anybody. It was voluntarily entered into as part of the PPF.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">People can make any criticism they wish of the process and the outcome, with which they may not agree. Even some of those in the unions do not agree with the result but it was an agreement voluntarily entered into that this was the way we would go about doing it and we would accept it.

Taxation did not, on this occasion, form a central part of the negotiations. The trade union leadership recognised, before we reached the table, that the days of big tax reductions were gone and that taxation would not form a central part of this agreement, as it did in other agreements. The Government, in other agreements, gave tax concessions which bolstered up the employer side. Everybody recognised that was not possible in this agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">I have not tabled a recommendation on the following point but I would like to hear the Minister's views on it. In the context of the various credits available to people in this section and in the wider way through SSIAs etc. a common issue is that of housing. I would like the Minister's view on my next point – I want only a personal view I do not expect him to give a detailed one at this stage. There is a strong case for establishing a scheme whereby young people saving for houses could do so within a determined and locked saving system to be used only for a deposit on a house and could then claim tax credit on it. I know there will be certain difficulties in implementing such a scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">SSIAs were intended for elderly people but it appears people of all ages have bought into them. We have had the argument on the first-time buyer's grant. I opposed the Government's decision to abolish that grant, though I said on that day, and since, that it is probably the worst possible way of giving money to first-time buyers because unscrupulous builders have invariably discounted it into the value of the house. Here would be a way, for first-time buyers on a one time only basis, to save in a designated account for a deposit on a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Will the Minister consider such an idea? I am not suggesting it could be done in this Finance Bill. I would like to develop this idea further with him if he is open to it. Many Senators on this side of the House and on the Minister's side would welcome such a development which would be of more benefit to first-time buyers than the first-time buyer's grant. It would benefit them more in many ways because they would save more, having received tax credit on their savings, than they would have gained had they received the first-time buyer's grant. Builders would not know about that money and could not, therefore, discount it into the price of the house. Houses could no longer be advertised as attracting extra money by way of the first-time buyer's grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">I have wanted to raised that issue with the Minister for some time and I am anxious to hear his views on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">Senator O'Toole put forward this interesting idea quite recently in the <i> Irish Examiner</i>. We looked at many ideas in this regard but I am open to having it looked at again and will do so before next year's budget and Finance Bill. The Senator is proposing that we encourage people to save in a particular fund which could only be used for deposit on a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I am loath to commit myself to another runaway success given the popularity of the SSIA scheme. People will be surprised when the final figures for year ending 31 December 2002 are published. People at all levels of income have subscribed to that scheme. That may horrify Senator McDowell and his party but the figures will illustrate it.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">Many people on the lower income scale have also contributed. The balance is fairly even throughout the levels of income. Senator McDowell's party felt the scheme would benefit only the better-off. That is not the case and the figures will prove it. It shows the practical commonsense of the Irish people in that when they see a good deal they go for it. There is nothing extraordinary about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Senator O'Toole's idea is an interesting one. I will instruct the Revenue Commissioners to look at the idea and have it assessed before next year's budget and Finance Bill. I am not giving a commitment that it will definitely take place but the principle is worthwhile. While Ministers and politicians should not make predictions I will be interested to see how the housing market pans out by this time next year. There is a fair amount of equilibrium coming into the market in all respects. We will have to wait and see. People said that three years ago and nothing happened. Let us wait and see what happens over the next year. I have expressed that feeling for some time now.</p>

          <p eId="para_429">I subscribe to Senator O'Toole's proposal which is an excellent idea. The SSIA was seen as a vehicle for delivering the kind of savings required by people wishing to purchase a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I made the point yesterday in regard to the SSIA scheme that 52,000 subscribers to Ark Life, a subsidiary of AIB, and 55,000 in Permanent-TSB are actually losing money as of now. The Government bonus of one euro for every four euro saved has disappeared. The amount invested is now being eroded. People are tied into a scheme whereby they must contribute a minimum amount up to €250 with no indication of light at the end of the tunnel because of the collapse in the equity market.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">We should try to provide an escape clause rather than tie people to this scheme, particularly those on low incomes who are trying to buy houses etc. If one opts out of the scheme, as the Minister readily acknowledged yesterday during the Second Stage debate, one will lose money and will also be liable for taxation. Surely it is possible to look at providing a tax concession whereby those who buy out of the scheme will have their tax waived. Nobody foresaw the current situation. We all applauded the Minister when he introduced this scheme. It should be possible to revisit the scheme to see if anything can be done to assist such people.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_433">I agree, but that may save time later. It is inevitable that there will be some drift on the first section of the Finance Bill. With respect, it was the Minister who helped us along that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I do now want to go over old history, but I will quickly refer to SSIAs. It goes without saying that if one cannot afford €256 per month, one cannot take full advantage of the scheme. Those who could not afford that kind of money did not benefit from it and, by definition, they are from the less well off sections of the community. My party made that criticism and I stand over it.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">It is not known, and there is no way of discovering, the extent to which these were simply displaced savings from somewhere else. My suspicion – it is no more than that because there is only anecdotal evidence – is that a lot of money was shifted by people from less productive savings schemes into SSIAs. People cannot be blamed for that and would have been daft not to do it. From their point of view, it is a perfectly attractive scheme and one which, I hope, many people will benefit from. I note that well over 1 million people hold these accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">That does not mean it made sense for the Exchequer to follow this course. The stated aim of SSIAs is to encourage people to save. I am not convinced that more people have been encouraged to save more money to a degree that would justify the cost of over €500 million per year, an extraordinary amount of money and one that would do a lot to keep open many of the hospital beds that will close in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I beg the Chair's indulgence to briefly mention the housing market, a matter to which Senators O'Toole and Higgins and the Minister also referred. I have become extremely cynical about what we are told by so-called experts and those involved in the housing market. In December 2001, the Minister responded to representations from the CIF and others that the apartment market in Dublin was collapsing and that nobody was building apartments. There was some evidence in terms of permissions granted, etc., that this was the case. However, it is now crystal clear that –in so far as there was a shortage at that time – it was a manufactured shortage and the position was quickly reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Only six months ago, we were told that rents in Dublin were falling – some six to nine months after the Minister reversed the previous policy. It is difficult to credit that the market could have been turned around so quickly unless it was managed in some way. I am suspicious of those – estate agents, the CIF, builders and developers in general – who make representations claiming that the market is either in a state of flux, that there is scarcity or whatever. The Departments of Finance and the Environment and Local Government must introduce some method by which an objective assessment can be made. Vested interests have controlled this market for far too long.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">I largely agree with Senator McDowell. Some people are in a position, with regard to housing and other products, to manipulate markets and to withhold or increase supply. Unfortunately, the fact that people are able to do this is something a Minister must take into account when making his decisions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_242">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_440">There is a real issue in regard to housing and I support what Senators McDowell and Higgins and the Minister have said. The market was managed. It drives me mad when I hear about housing being released to young couples looking to put a roof over their heads. Something is happening here. Over 50,000 houses and apartments are being built each year, a figure higher that is than the birth rate. Couples take about 30,000 units per year, leaving 20,000 extra houses or apartments coming on to the market. That figure does not take the death rate into consideration, but I will allow for immigration to account for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The Taoiseach at a recent meeting referred to "the big six" as those who owned most of the development land in the Dublin area. That is the language that has been used by Senator McDowell's party for some years and I fully agree with it. The problem is that when a certain level is reached – it is fast approaching – people will not live in some of the older apartments that built ten or 15 years ago and are of a lesser standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I watch rent prices continually and use one particular benchmark in that regard, namely, rents in the IFSC. The cost of monthly rental there more than one year ago was over £1,000 per month for a single bedroom apartment. There are four apartments advertised in today's newspapers for €900 to €930 per month. There is no doubt that the rental market is dropping and there is anecdotal evidence that some units are also empty.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I do not agree that the Minister should have rowed back on the recommendations in the Bacon report last year. I said at the time that I wanted him to row back in certain areas and for certain types of housing so that investors would not be in opposition to first-time buyers. He chose to take the broader, easier way which he said would work. Some investors are now getting their tails burned and that may continue to do so in the near future. The coming year will indicate a great deal about the housing market.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_243" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_444">I do not want to go over the housing area again because I had to introduce two additional Finance Bills to deal with the Bacon reports in 1998 and 2000. I said at that time – I said it off script on many occasions and it was lucky that I did – that any interference in the market would cause difficulties. As Senator O'Toole said, we are back to where we started. I think I will be proved correct in that the answer to this problem is supply. When supply is greater than demand, prices will go down and when demand is greater than supply, costs go up. I have been proven correct regarding the rental market.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The reverse in the 2001 budget was made with the intention of getting apartments built for letting and that has been done. I am not going to work it all out, but, if Senators consider the position they will see that it will have an effect throughout the housing market. There are only so many people looking for houses and only so many houses available. If somebody has a lot of one product on their shelf or in the form of a house and the bank manager is roaring at that person, he or she will have to start shipping or moving that product. When that happens, prices will drop and there will be a balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The Senators and I are coming from different ends of the spectrum. I believe fundamentally in the free market, whether that is with regard to the price of chocolate, cattle or houses and I think I will be proved correct.</p>

          <p eId="para_454">I estimate that, on average, some 45,000 units per year have been provided for the past five years, including some 50,000 in the past two years. That is enough to meet demand. It will be seen who is correct on this. There is a move to interfere in other areas of the market, but I am loath to do that and I urge caution. It might be popular and might look like the thing to do, but, in this type of market, that is not always the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">With regard to the price of cattle, my first speech in Dáil Éireann in 1977 was on the setting up of the economic planning and development programme of the former Minister, Mr. Martin O'Donoghue. I spoke about the ludicrous situation which then existed regarding guidance prices. I said that any business system, for making matchboxes or anything else, which guaranteed a set price for a matchbox or other product, no matter how many were produced, must fall on its head.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The final number of SSIA holders is not yet available, but I can inform the House that there are approximately 1.17 million of them. The final figures, which will provide information about the number of people who have invested in equity related accounts, will not be available until the annual reports have been published. However, I have read a document which suggests that the number of such people is between 200,000 and 250,000. Those who invested in special savings accounts that are linked to equities, who comprise between 20% and 25% of the total, took a chance and knew what they were doing. They would be laughing at people who invested in fixed interest accounts if the market had increased. I do not favour compensating those who took a chance and knew what they were doing. The SSIA scheme is quite generous and I have no intention of introducing compensation mechanisms. The scheme was introduced to encourage people to save for five years and they knew when they opened an account they would be penalised if they closed it. Most people decided to open safe and secure ordinary deposit rate accounts, but some of us decided to open the other form of account, knowing that we were depending on the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">In page 13, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_462">1.–In respect of the year of assessment 2003 and subsequent years of assessment, section 466 of the Principal Act is amended by substituting ‘€100' for ‘€60'.".</p>
          <p eId="para_463">This relief has fallen into disuse, although if memory serves, the Minister has made clear that he favours the principle of doing something with it. This recommendation is being brought forward as a way of giving recognition and financial support to those who look after a relative with a disability or a child with particular medical difficulties. As matters stand, a tax credit of only €60 per year is given, but we should look to improve the matter over time, if the public funds allow us to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I have proposed this recommendation to get the Minister to elucidate his opinion of this tax relief. I am aware that there are other means, within the tax system and otherwise, whereby the Minister and the State attempt to provide assistance to people in the circumstances I have mentioned. It seems that a case still needs to be made for providing a relief of the kind suggested in this recommendation within the income tax code.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_465">The intention of this recommendation is to increase the dependent relative tax credit from €60 to €100 per annum. The credit was significant for a long time, until the recent past, not for its monetary value but because it opened up the way for other reliefs, including relief in respect of the medical expenses of a dependent relative and mortgage interest relief in respect of a loan obtained for the purpose of a dwelling used rent-free by such a relative. Such relief has not been contingent on entitlement to the dependent relative tax credit since the definition of dependent relative, for the purposes of medical expenses, was changed in the Finance Act 2001. The importance of the dependent relative tax credit, therefore, has declined and I am not inclined to revitalise it. I indicated to the Dáil during a debate on the Finance Bill last year that I would like to make the tax credit certificate so simple that it would not, in effect, contain anything other than the single or married tax credit and tax band. In the circumstances I have outlined, I cannot support the recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The cost of this recommendation is estimated at €600,000 in 2003 and €800,000 in a full year. As I signalled to Senator McDowell last year, I intended to limit the presence of the smaller tax credits on the tax free allowance certificate. The dependent relative tax credit, for example, is just €60 per year, so it does not benefit those who claim it to any great extent, particularly as the relevant amount of money before one enters the tax credit has been increased. I signalled last year that I intend to remove the credit and other similar credits from the tax code. I would like to make the tax allowance certificate as simple as possible and I would have done so in the budget, were it not for the fact that I wanted to make minimal changes to the tax code this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I signalled in the Dáil and in this House that I was thinking of doing nothing, but I made minimal changes – in relation to the employee tax credit and the small increase in the exemption for elderly people – that cost just €196 million, in order to keep 90% of people who earn the minimum wage out of the tax net. If I removed many small allowances, having stated that I intended to make minimum changes, a hullabaloo would have been raised about a cost to the Exchequer of an insignificant sum, such as €5 million or €10 million. Senator McDowell's colleagues in the Dáil would have said that I was imposing taxes on the small people again.</p>

          <p eId="para_479">"2.–Section 15 of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion after subsection (2) of the following subsection:</p>
          <p eId="para_480">‘3.–The amounts specified in column (1) of this table shall be automatically increased for each year of assessment by a percentage equal to the annualised rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index last published by the Central Statistics Office before the commencement of the year of assessment'.".</p>
          <p eId="para_481">This recommendation is self-explanatory. Since he became Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy has, quite rightly, received plaudits for the manner in which he has reduced the rate of taxation in successive budgets. When one reflects on the position 15 or 20 years ago, when 60% or 65% of one's monthly earnings was being taken by the State and when taxation was generally acknowledged as a scourge by the PAYE sector, one cannot doubt that there have been considerable improvements. One must give credit where it is due.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">A great deal of the progress has been lost, however, as a consequence of the fact that more than one-third of taxpayers will be paying the 42% rate by the end of 2003. This arises directly from the failure to increase tax bands and tax credits. Despite the large increases in the bands and credits last year, an additional 70,000 people were brought into the higher tax bracket for the first time. I accept that the percentage of taxpayers paying the higher rate decreased from 32% in the 1999-2000 to 27% in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The fundamental point I want to make is that it appears that the progress made in recent years will, in effect, be wiped out in 2003. More than one third of taxpayers will be paying the top rate of tax by the end of the year. The net fallout from this will be that the Government will have saved almost €600 million by not indexing tax bands to wage increases in 2003. Taxpayers will fork out €600 million this year as a result of the Government's decision not to introduce indexation.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The figures to which I refer make clear that the gains and successes of recent years, for which I have given the Minister credit, will be more than wiped out. There was a substantial increase last year, when an additional 72,000 people found themselves in the 42% tax bracket. Substantially more people will be caught in the higher bracket as a result of the fact that the bands and credits have been frozen for the current year.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">My recommendations suggest that the Minister should link the tax bands to the consumer price index, which is the Bible beautiful in terms of the impact of the cost of living on the public.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_486">I am on common ground with Senator McDowell. Indexation is a bad principle. I cannot believe that any Fine Gael Minister for Finance over the past 20 years would have accepted it or would accept it now. It removes some of the essential flexibility that a Minister needs in formulating a budget. In really good years one can exceed the requirements of indexation, which the Minister did over a number of budgets. In other years, one might match its requirements or one might be below its requirements. I recall a budget in 1987 in which there was no increase at all in reliefs, bands or allowances.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">One cannot foresee circumstances. The social partners recognise that indexation is a bad principle and they do not include it in the taxation section of Sustaining Progress. It is not even implied. They recognise that the tax system has to produce what we need for essential spending. The Government is committed to maintaining the rates at their current levels. The rates represent a significant achievement and it is senseless to talk of returning to our previous position. It is not long since at least 40% of the people, if not more, paid tax at the higher rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">The Government and the country received great praise from the OECD yesterday for the policy of keeping tax low. It was said that the policy should act as an example to governments in other jurisdictions. It will be quite a battle to maintain the current tax rates of 20% and 42%. When there is pressure on the public finances, as there is this year, it is inevitable that one has to resort to under-indexation, a certain widening of the tax base and other measures. I agree with the fundamental point being made by the OECD, which is that our policy is good for confidence and competition. The Minister has my support in what he has been doing to maintain the rates as they stand. Even if we did not have the particular problems we have this year, tying a Minister to indexation would be undesirable. The Italian economy, which used to be in bad shape, had a principle of indexation known as the "<i>scala mobile</i>”, which sounds like the name of a Rossini opera. We do not want to go down that road.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_489">Senator Mansergh has somewhat, but not entirely, misrepresented my position. There is an argument for indexation and for saying that, in any given year, allowances and credits should increase in line with the CPI for the previous year. That is not to say that I would necessarily have favoured index-linking the reliefs, allowances and credits to the CPI this year. I can see why the Minister did not do so and have some sympathy with his position. However, there is an argument for being explicit so that a Minister who increases income tax by stealth will have to say so.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The Minister has chosen to increase indirect taxation, although he has not said so explicitly. He has done so by giving the nod to various State bodies that wanted to increase charges, and he has increased VAT explicitly. As I said on Second Stage, I am not convinced that this is the time to increase indirect taxes, although one could make an argument for doing so in different circumstances. For the first time in many years, we have a genuine competitiveness problem, partly because of the state of the international economy and largely because of the appreciation of the euro in recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">This is not the time to give a 2% push to inflation. If the cost of not doing so would have been to increase income tax or corporation tax, for example, I would have taken that approach. There are times when increasing indirect taxes is the least painful method, but this is not the time to do so because we have to keep a careful eye on competitiveness. The Minister has made a mistake if, as I suspect, he has adopted this method. I read the tax strategy group papers which stated that there was scope for increased charges and indirect taxation, but this is not the time for doing so.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_269" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_492">The purpose of these recommendations is the indexation of the tax bands and certain tax credits. Such a move would be costly for the Exchequer. For example, if a figure of 4.6%, representing the best available estimate of the rate of growth in the CPI for 2002 over 2001, was to be assumed, the full year cost of indexing the standard rate band would be about €192 million in a full year. In addition, a similar increase in the main personal credits and allowances would cost approximately €165 million in a full year. Overall, at such a rate of annual increase, costs of almost €363 million per annum could be expected to arise. Clearly, tax expenditure on such a scale would severely limit the Government's flexibility in determining budgetary priorities having regard to the economic realities in any given year.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">It is important that the Government retains flexibility as to the size of the personal income tax package as against other priorities and the composition of any package. For example, in this year's budget the employee credit is being increased by 21% to ensure, in light of the limited resources available, 90% of the increased minimum wage is exempt from taxation, although it was increased again in 2002. It now stands at €6.35 per hour. If limited resources were spread equally across all bands and credits, it would be more difficult to target resources in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The overriding aims of the Government's budgetary and economic policy, as set out in An Agreed Programme for Government, are clear. It is committed to sustaining economic growth, strengthening and maintaining the competitive position of the economy and maintaining full employment. Responsible fiscal policies are central to the achievement of these aims and it is not clear that making statutory provision for the indexation of bands and credits would be consistent with this approach. The most recent data from the OECD pertaining to 2002 and concerning a single person on the average production wage show that Ireland has the lowest tax rate in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I remind Senators of the fundamental change in the tax system in recent years. Tax credits have been increased, tax rates have been reduced substantially and there has been a significant widening of the standard rate band. These factors make the tax system inherently fairer and all taxpayers have benefited from the increases. The Government already has clear policy priorities regarding personal taxation, including a priority to ensure all those on the national minimum wage are removed from the tax net and that 80% of all earners pay tax only at the standard rate. However, the achievement of these aims is subject to the overarching requirements of sound economic and fiscal policies. We are keeping the public finances in order and thus I cannot accept the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Senator Mansergh referred to keeping the tax rates at 20% and 42%, the achievement of which he regarded as significant. He stated that there would be a battle to maintain the rates at these levels and it is the goal of the Government to do so. As the Senator pointed out, we were commended as recently as yesterday by the OECD officials in Dublin for our low tax rates. Low rates give a push to the economy and stimulate growth over and above that of our neighbours.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Senators McDowell and Higgins will be aware of our friends in Europe, particularly Germany and France, which have had difficulties. There has been a stagnation of economic growth and their heavy taxation policies have impacted dramatically on incentives for businesses and employees. Efforts are being made by the German Chancellor and Finance Minister to make some worthwhile changes. They have copied some of the Irish ways of doing things and are finding great difficulty in doing so. We have got it down to what I regard as a reasonable level. If we can keep it at that level, we will have a future competitive advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">I know that not everybody in Irish life agrees with my theories on taxation as the engine of economic growth but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. We have been successful in doing it our way. Countries which have tried the other way for generations have failed, something we have learned from the Irish experience. That is not to say we are perfect in every regard and that we cannot make changes but in recent years our ways of doing things are better than those in continental European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">In response to Senator Higgins, Senator Mansergh made the point very eloquently regarding automatic indexation for which there is no case. Not alone does the tax credit limit the flexibility of Ministers for Finance into the future but an automatic index to anything is not necessarily a good thing. I have seen this in the areas of public expenditure where we have particular schemes. When the partners come to bid with the Minister for Finance, they never think of doing away with the scheme. I am sure the Senator has experienced this when in government. The scheme might have long outlived its usefulness but with a whole plethora of civil servants behind it, no one ever suggests doing away with it. They all must get their 4% every year. If the Government decided on a 4% increase in expenditure overall, everyone thinks all the schemes must get it when what we should be saying is that all of the increase on this occasion must go to one area.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">I will use the example of defence. If I use any other area, it will be deemed that I am making a political point against some of my colleagues. If the Government for some reason decides to allocate all the extra moneys to the Department of Defence, that means those moneys must come from other Departments, that they will not get any increase or the allocations of some must be reduced but that is not the way it is. Every Department and Minister will feel that this is terrible, that they will not be regarded as very strong Ministers unless they get an increase for their Departments also, ever though there might be no need for particular schemes. That is the approach we tried to adopt this year in the Estimates with the assistance of the independent Estimates review committee or the three wise men's report. We gave most resources to the Department of Health and Children. It got the bulk of any increases going. Other Departments had to take hits. That is the proper approach to doing business.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">If there were automatic indexation, everybody would have to get the same increase every year. If we were to build this into legislation regarding taxation bands, credits or allowances, we would limit the flexibility of the Minister for Finance. We must always retain maximum flexibility depending on the state of the public finance at any given time. I understand the purpose behind the recommendation but it would not be the way to go. No Government or Minister for Finance would be inclined to tie their hands in that way.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_270">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_502">The purpose of a taxation regime is to raise revenue in order to run the State. The purpose of tax bands, allowances and credits is to achieve a balance between the amount taken from one's income or resources, on the one hand, and the amount somebody needs to maintain his or her living standards and keep body and soul together, on the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">From the point of view of the merits or otherwise of indexation, the principle of indexation is irrefutable. While this might be a difficult year, the whole principle of adjusting or relating income tax allowances and increases to the consumer price index which, as I said previously, is the manual for determining the cost of living, is irrefutable. The Minister is right when he says it would limit the scope of the Minister for Finance. Of course, it would, it would take much of the gloss off the Budget Statement – everybody waits with bated breath to see what the Minister gives by way of various tax concessions, reductions, etc. but the linking of the two together is irrefutable and uncontradictable from the point of view of its merits. One would adjust it on an ongoing, regular basis with the consumer price index, the price of living, in order to ensure a fair balance, between what is taken, on the one hand, and given, on the other, is maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The reality is that the Minister for Finance has a double whammy. On the one hand, he is using price increases as a way of collecting of taxes. He is using inflation as a tax collecting tool. I alluded on Second Stage to the increases that have happened this year. For example, motor tax is up 12%; hospital charges are 26%; the threshold for qualifying for the health boards' drug refund scheme is up 31%; VHI charges are up 18%; cigarettes and alcohol are up 15%; bank and card charges are up 29%; ESB charges are up 13%; college fees are up 9%; parking fees are up26%; Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann fares – announced the week after the budget by the Minister for Transport – are up 9%, while the television licence fee is up 40%. These are just some of the stealth taxes that have been increased. Therefore, the consumer is taking a double hit. On the one hand, the cost of living and inflation are going up and, on the other, while the Minister's case in relation to those over the age of 65 years may have merit, there were absolutely no concessions whatsoever to the vast bulk or huge tranche of people caught in the middle income sector from the point of view of giving them some relief by way of tax bands and credits. I am disappointed that the Minister will not even concede the fundamental principle, although he has acknowledged that there are particular difficulties this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The tax strategy group indicated that linking tax bands and credits to inflation – my figures are at variance with those of the Minister – would cost somewhere in the region of €250 million according to the Department's calculations, although there is a variation between the figure given by the Minister sometime ago in his scripted response and mine. This figure of €250 million was based at the time on the pre-budget inflation estimates of 3.2%. However, the decision to raise around €1 billion in indirect taxes means that inflation will be closer to 4.5% or possibly even 5%, thereby further increasing the amount of stealth taxes. Therefore, I am absolutely convinced that the merits of what I am proposing are irrefutable, sound, and should be accepted in principle, perhaps not this year, by the Minister as the way to go in the future to ensure income tax allowances are given in line with increases in the cost of living <i> a la</i> the Bible beautiful, the consumer price index, CPI, as I said previously.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">Other things being equal, of course it is desirable to index tax allowances and bands. For most of the last five years, this has been done. In fact, more than this has been done but there are other circumstances where one is in the downward part of the cycle where it is not easy to do so. There is a lot of talk about stealth taxes. It is perfectly transparent as far as the public is concerned that the Government has not been able to fully index tax allowances and that to keep the public finances on a reasonably even keel it has also been necessary to increase charges. In some of the instances named – I think the television licence fee was mentioned – charges have not been increased for years, if not decades. This has to be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">To come back to the point, it is a good principle of fiscal management, in any year's conditions, not just this year's, for the Minister to retain flexibility. What has been done is what he sees as necessary to keep the rates in place. The alternative, as Senator McDowell has pointed out, would have been to straightforwardly raise the rates of income tax but that would have been very undesirable.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_277">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_513">I was going to let it pass but as the Minister has come back in I will take the opportunity to respond to one or two of the points he made during his exposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">A couple of years ago there was something resembling a consensus, perhaps not well-worked out but a consensus nonetheless, on what where the primary drivers of our economic growth and boom. It was traditional at that stage to list factors such as social partnership, the labour market, the existence of a well-educated, English speaking workforce, with some mention too of the taxation system. It is interesting to see how the Minister has quite successfully rewritten history here because he has written off all the factors which most of us regarded as more important. He has now decided that the boom was tax driven, and more specifically that the driver was his own low taxation policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I accept that taxation policy has a role. The low rate of corporation tax is probably more important now than at any time in the past ten years. Income tax rates have a lesser role. I do not accept that our economic growth and boom have been driven exclusively by this Minister's policy of low income tax rates. That does not stand up to any examination whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">He mentions Germany and France. It is easy to refer to the Federal Republic of Germany as a basket case. This is a country which in the past ten years has managed to do something which is almost unprecedented in recent history in that it has incorporated a bankrupt communist state, with a negligible infrastructure, into a functioning Western style social market economy. It achieved this with relatively small tax increases. The Federal Republic of Germany has been a major success. Although it is experiencing some difficulties today it manages to maintain the essence of social welfare and health systems which are infinitely superior to ours. Like France it has a public transport system which is also far superior to ours, and while everybody would acknowledge that it has problems, particularly in the labour market, I am sure our Social Democrat and Green colleagues can overcome these without lectures from the right to help them along the way.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">I spent a very pleasant five months as Minister for Finance with my colleague, Mr. Oskar La Fontaine, who was Minister for Finance in the German Republic until he decided to vacate the position. He was a most pleasant individual and we had many interesting talks. I notice that he is making his presence felt again in the German press although many people thought he was going to retire. He has announced his retirement three or four times.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The Senator will have noted in recent weeks that Mr. Schröder intends to make several economic and social changes. He has announced very tough proposals regarding the welfare state. I do not know whether the German political system will allow this to occur. I do know the difficulties for my friend Mr. Eichel and the proposals he made regarding some taxation changes and the problems Mr. Schröder has in trying to implement them. I make this point because the German Government recognises that it is necessary to have a pretty flexible and attractive system in the business and the personal tax areas. Germany is not alone in seeing that low taxation policies have helped economic success.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I never said that tax changes are the only drivers of economic growth in Ireland and I do not wish to claim personal credit for this. I do claim personal credit for some tax changes and certainly my party and our partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats, can claim them, but I am not saying that all the development and our recent economic success are the result of tax changes. Each of the items which the Senator refers to, from social partnership to foreign direct investment and lower business tax and so on, has contributed to that success, together with social factors such as the young workforce. Thanks to policies of investing in education, sustained over about 40 years, we had a young, well-educated workforce at a time in European economic history when the rest of Europe was experiencing zero population growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Social partnership was another important factor because it created certainty that we could reach comprehensive agreements. We invented social partnership but the idea was modelled on what the Germans had been doing for a long time. We tailored this to Irish circumstances and it has worked very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I add to that, as I have always done, that the major change in financial policy was brought in by the Government led by Mr. Charles Haughey from 1987 to 1992. As someone who was a known critic of Mr. Haughey for other reasons in the 1980s, I was the first to compliment him when he went in the other direction. History will be very good to him in that regard, irrespective of troubles in other areas. I have said so in the Lower House, as Senator McDowell knows, and publicly, although some journalists condemn me for it but to say anything less would be unfair to the historical record.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">As for my attitude to indirect taxation I am sure Senator McDowell has noticed over the years in my time as Minister for Finance and as Opposition Spokesperson on finance that I believe in low direct tax rates. Other colleagues, and those in other parties, refer to it as lower taxation but I have always referred to lower direct taxation, be it business, personal, capital, or whatever. I am sure Senator McDowell has noted that in all my utterances both here and in the Dáil during his considerable tenure as a Deputy. I allow him to draw his own conclusions.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">I recall vividly my work as Opposition Chief Whip at the time, trying to maintain the delicate balance of keeping a minority Government in power, provided it continued with a fiscal policy that would the benefit the nation. The party came under considerable criticism at the time because we were not voting in the Dáil and we adopted that line out of a sense of commitment to the national interest. I recall being lambasted on the basis that the role of the Opposition was to oppose come what may, and we had set aside that fundamental temptation in the national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">It was a happy development in relation to the maturity of politics and politicians, and the political system, that we decided on several issues to adopt a bilateral approach, or consensus politics. One of those issues was the welfare of the economy and thankfully that has been maintained by and large in the interim. The second issue was Northern Ireland. These areas were politically sacrosanct from the point of view of a consensus. While we might vary with regard to the margins, the strategy has been largely maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I do not wish to score political points, but increased taxes are the result of the two-year period when public spending increased by 40% while revenue increased at a rate of between 5% and 6%. This fundamental difficulty with the public finances has limited the Minister's ability to make even marginal increases at the top and the bottom rates of tax. I acknowledge what the Minster has done for those aged over 65, but it was the increase in public spending by 40% in the two years leading up to the general election which caused the constraints in relation to tax concessions. We spent 7.5 times what we were earning.</p>

          <p eId="para_536">I fully agree that Fine Gael deserves much credit for the Tallaght strategy. In the period in question, the high growth rate of between 8% and 10% and surpluses of up to £4 billion put great strain on infrastructure. The Government had leeway and people from all quarters were pressing us to spend money. The Minister for Finance maintained a substantial surplus for most of the five years in which the previous Administration held office until the downturn hit. I cannot say in which areas Senator Higgins would have refrained from spending during the period.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">We still have considerable infrastructural and social needs and I am not sure the criticism that we engaged in overspending can be sustained. Cumulative growth of more than 8.5% resulted in huge bottlenecks which needed to be tackled and which involved increases in spending. People's expectations have risen way above what they were and while that is on the whole a good thing, we must manage demand sensibly. I do not accept the criticism. We used the margins that resulted from the establishment of a healthy financial position. I am not sure that holding money in reserve to alleviate the top rate of tax should have been or should now be the priority.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_542">In each of my years as Minister for Finance, I have achieved an overall Exchequer surplus. Debt has been reduced to 34% of GDP, which is the second lowest ratio in the European Union. In the five years of the previous Administration, the Government increased gross public spending by nearly 100% from a figure of roughly €18 billion in 1997. Gross public spending will be of the order of €38 billion in 2003, while the net figure will be around €30 billion. With that money we increased the number of public sector workers, most of whom were employed in the public health area. We increased spending on education, health and welfare, while implementing pension provisions we were anxious to make by giving the old age pensioner an income of €100 per week. As a result of our economic success, we were able to achieve things in the social arena about which we could only dream in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">We were able to provide €5 billion in tax reductions, the details of which I outlined earlier. Those provisions gave us the most attractive direct taxation regime for the lower paid in the European Union and among OECD countries. We reduced the national debt as a percentage of GDP as well as in absolute terms. I have invested a great deal of money in the national pensions reserve fund to provide for future demographic change. Senator Higgins might disagree with our spending decisions as he has a different perspective, but that is where much of the money went. I paid off debts which were hanging around and for which there was no credit, including the debt incurred from the break up of An Post and Telecom Éireann many years ago. I used €800 million to pay off the overhanging liability in that area in one year. I paid off other liabilities which had built up and which will not now be carried over.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Senator Mansergh asked about the areas of public spending in respect of which people would have had me make cutbacks in the past five years. I recall hearing demands on the radio every morning from politicians and lobby groups for greater spending in their areas. People wanted more changes in taxation at every level to reduce the top rate and to take people out of the system at the bottom. All of that was done. I increased spending when we had the resources. During the lifetime of the previous Administration, the economy grew by roughly 50% which is something that has been achieved by no other country in the developed world in recent economic history. The population began to increase and we experienced the problems of immigration rather than of emigration.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Senator Mansergh and I spent every hour of our waking political lives worrying about how we were going to find jobs for the masses of young people who were coming into the labour market. We reduced unemployment from 18% to less than 5% and instead of seeing between 40,000 to 50,000 people leaving the country each year, we saw between 20,000 to 40,000 coming in. Instead of worrying about finding jobs for people, we found ourselves formulating an employment policy to allow more people to enter the country to take up vacant positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">These are the problems of economic success, but as a famous actor once said "I have been rich and I have been poor and rich is better." I remember the days when there was no congestion on the Naas dual carriageway because there was nobody travelling to work and my attitude is that rich is better. Few people could afford a car and there was perhaps one for every three or four households where I used to live. Now there are households with four and five cars. The problems of society which have been mentioned must be looked at in the context of that success. We increased spending by 40% over two years and with the turn in the economic tide, I made adjustments. Last year the spending target was 14.4% and we came in at 13.9%. The figure this year should be about 7%. We cut our cloth according to our measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I ask those commentators who refer to problems resulting from allowing spending to grow by 40% over two years what they would have done differently. On what would they have refused to spend money? If I had limited spending to half the amount over the two years in question, aside from the political ramifications of people roaring for greater spending and reduced taxation, I would have increased the surplus. The effect of increasing the surplus would have been to reduce our debt even further.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">I could have taken additional money out and invested it in the national pensions reserve fund. Leaving aside the political ramifications of that action – with people crying for better hospitals, schools, etc. – I would have been saying to my Cabinet colleagues that we had plenty of money and that we should reduce the national debt even further. At that stage I bought the national debt down from approximately 70% to 50%.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">If I had said I wanted to put more money into the national pensions reserve fund, Senators McDowell and Higgins – who were both Deputies at the time – would have claimed I could not do so because the roads to Ballyhaunis and Claremorris were falling apart and more money was needed to facilitate their repair. People want more social needs assistance and want social welfare funding to be increased. Had I been able to hold out and achieve that goal, the surplus would have increased. When there is a surplus at the end of the year, all that happens is that the debt gets lower. It is not put in another place and held there for the next year so that we can spend it then. That is the way we have been doing business in public financial terms since time immemorial.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The case could be made that perhaps reserve funds should be set up so that they could be thrown into the economy at various stages. That would not count at all in EU terms for the 3% stability pact. There are anomalies in the stability and growth pact and I have spoken about them at many fora, but this is the first opportunity I have to spell out the position in clear terms. I have heard eminent commentators discussing this great increase. I will provide an example and I am willing to listen to an opposite view. The policy we adopted of increasing spending in the social areas with the largesse that we had available and striking a balance between that and taxation changes was the best economic prescription. At the same time, we ran overall budget surpluses and overall Exchequer surpluses.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">In the 1980s, I thought it would be a major achievement if a Government could achieve current budget balance. It was only from the mid-1990s onwards that Senator Mansergh and I, when working on the Fianna Fáil manifesto, began to realise that we might achieve an overall Exchequer balance. We never dreamed that would occur in the 1970s or 1980s. I would have seen it as a major achievement if a Government got back to a current budget balance. However, we achieved an overall Exchequer balance and a surplus. I do not know how this relates to the matter under discussion, but I wanted to use the opportunity, while within the hallowed walls of this House, to put this on the record.</p>

          <p eId="para_559">I still take an interest in these matters. I have not given up on the people of Dublin North-Central and I like to persuade myself at times that they have not altogether given up on me.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I agree with the Minister. I note what the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, said a few months ago when he effectively blamed the stability and growth pact for the failure to deliver on public transport in Dublin and the failure to make real progress on the metro. This is completely at variance with Government statements which indicated that it was a "sovereign commitment".</p>
          <p eId="para_561">It is useful and important to debate this matter publicly. I know the Minister has been making the point with the Commission and at Council meetings. Before we have a difficulty with the 3%, it is important that countries like Ireland make that argument publicly.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">In 2003, Ireland will probably end up, in GGB terms, with a deficit of 0.6%. Everyone is supposed to be close to balance or in surplus. There is no rule about it, but it would generally be taken to be 0.5%.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_305" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_564">I was about to deal with that matter. There was a hint that this was going to be a bit of a laugh and that Ireland could possibly be criticised and have maybe a deficit of 0.6%. We were regarded as close to balance on the basis of the cyclically adjusted budgetary balance, which is a very complicated method of calculation used in recent years – it is too complicated for any politician to examine – and which brings it to a particular level. The Exchequer borrowing requirement for this year will be 0.6%, while it is projected as being 1.2% for 2004 and 2005. That does not mean that I must adhere to those particular figures and I will make whatever changes are necessary in the budget. That is also cyclically adjusted going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">We are at the very edge in terms of what is allowed. The EU will not allow a small country such as Ireland to move up to 3%. Germany and France have arrived at 3% and Portugal went beyond it. However, Ireland would not be allowed to approach that figure because it would be regarded as being too dangerous for a small country to do so. This stability and growth pact is very restrictive, particularly at the level of low debt such as ours.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">We are in Gordon Brown's camp. He wants to do something with public services and we want to do something regarding infrastructure. The UK has the third lowest debt ratio. It is not part of the euro and its figure stands at approximately 39% or 40%, depending on how it is calculated. Mr. Brown will deliver his budget, which was delayed because of the war in Iraq, on 8 April. The financial situation in the UK has been deteriorating in the past year. In November, Mr. Brown announced that borrowing would be in the order of £10 billion and it has now gone from that to £20 billion. It could still be revised upwards to £30 billion. The UK will probably be next to reach the 3% mark, but such a development is not as serious because it is not involved with the euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">We have low debt but very poor infrastructure. If we learned anything in 1999, 2000 and 2001, it is that investing money in infrastructure is not necessarily the best action. Doing so stokes up inflation. I will give an example to prove this point. A few years ago, the CIF advised us not to put all the projects on stream at the same time because we did not have the capacity. We were cautioned to hold back, but a year ago the CIF was telling us to release them. It is a basic economic principle that too much money taking too few goods means a rise in price. The construction industry and civil engineering firms quoted any price they liked because there was a small pool to do all the work. We were getting less value for money in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The terms of the stability and growth pact are very restrictive. We made a big effort and luckily we were in the same camp as the UK. I had my differences some years ago with Mr. Solbes, but we are very friendly now.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">As already stated, the terms of the pact are restrictive. Belgium has a debt ratio of approximately 100%, Italy 109% and Ireland 34%. Belgium has a high debt ratio, while Ireland has a low debt ratio. When we joined the euro everyone was supposed to reach a level of 60%, which seems to have been forgotten. I am willing to accept that there should be a matrix of different rules for smaller and larger countries. I do not want the Irish economy to be compared to its German counterpart. We have a population of 4 million, while Germany has a population of approximately 80 million. They have a very good road and railway network, therefore, it appears stupid to compare this country to Germany.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_577">Something which has not been widely commented on is the cap I placed on public service numbers. During the term of the previous Government, the number of public servants increased by 50,000, of which approximately 40,000 were recruited to the health service. I imposed a cap on these numbers in the budget and indicated that there must be a reduction of 5,000 over the next two years. Much of this will be achieved through natural wastage, etc. It is important to put a cap on numbers because we cannot continue to expand at the previous rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Most of the 40% increase over the two years relates to public pay and pensions. More than half of the net current budget is spent on pay and pensions. As any business person will know, control of expenditure is related to the numbers of people employed and the rates at which they are paid. If the numbers employed are increasing and the rates being paid are substantial, it does not take a great mathematician to work out that costs will increase. A good deal of the increases have gone on pay, and one can understand why this is the case. Health is a caring service, involving doctors, nurses paramedics and so on. The same applies to education.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The policy is to cap the numbers at approximately 280,000, reducing it by 5,000 over two years. This will not be a great imposition because much of it will be achieved by way of natural wastage. I have sent a clear signal that this is the limit. Proposals coming before the Government over the years have included additional numbers such as one assistant secretary, four principal officers, two assistant principal officers, etc. Just to announce the weather on days the Cabinet meets would require additional staff. All areas of the public service, from the Civil Service to agencies, see this as another way of acquiring additional staff. I sent a clear signal in the budget that there will be a cap on numbers in the public service at approximately 280,000. I am pleased to be able to reiterate that policy because it has not been commented on since the budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_588">Given the figures in recent years, no one could accuse the Government of being anti-public service. The public service has expanded and blossomed. I do not like the implication that public servants, <i>per se</i>, are less productive than others in the marketplace. I have equal respect for people who work in the private and public sectors. They both do essential jobs. The only difference is that in the public sector it is not easy to measure productivity and output by means of profit. From my experience in the public service, there is a lot of unexploited scope for redeployment. That is why the overall cap is a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Under the previous Government, there was a reduction of approximately 1,000 in the number serving in the Defence Forces and a corresponding increase in size of the Garda Síochána. New functions will arise which will require proper staffing, but in a large public service it should be possible to redeploy people. That aspect has been unexploited and perhaps this new system will provide an incentive to pursue it.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The debate on the stability and growth pact was interesting. Ireland's comfortable position within the parameters of the pact is a cause of confidence. Germany greatly distrusted the financial discipline of countries such as Ireland and insisted on the adherence by all member countries to the straightjacket of the pact. It is, therefore, ironic that it should be the first country to reach the ceiling imposed. At the time of the application of the pact in late 1998-9, the Minister had a good relationship with his German counterpart, Oskar Lafontaine.

          <p eId="para_592">If the bigger countries impose pressure to modify the pact, we should seek to ensure that any changes accommodate our interests. Speaking in the presence of the former Minister for Public Enterprise, I caution against the suggestion that we seek an exemption to fund public transport projects on the basis of our low level of debt. While I am in favour of public transport, I am against wasting huge sums of public money. I am not satisfied that matters are under control or that the most economical methods of making progress are being pursued. It would be deplorable if we were to almost bankrupt ourselves because we thought we were adopting something costing €4 billion which then escalated to a cost of €8 billion or €12 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">There may be a case for following the example of other cities and pursuing a more incremental approach by extending the infrastructure organically. In this regard, I wonder if it is the best approach for Governments to announce grand plans covering the next ten, 15 or 20 years. While the Luas light rail system will be a great success, we should work within our capacity constraints and in this regard it must be asked if we could achieve more by taking an incremental approach.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">When I was a member of a Fianna Fáil think tank, I suggested that Senator O'Rourke's former Department should be called the Department of Public Enterprise to emphasise that, like businesses, the State must be enterprising in its approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I disagree with Senator McDowell's suggestion that the best people leave the public service. Many are not in a position to leave because of mortgage or family responsibilities. I was able to take a career break under a scheme introduced by the then coalition Government in 1986. From there I was able to pursue risk in the knowledge that I could have returned to the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Being an entrepreneur, I believe it is critical that vision and enterprise be part of the public service and the Civil Service. In this regard, it cannot be repeated too often that many public servants are visionary and entrepreneurial. They are not bureaucratic.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I tire of talk about the Germany. I visited that country when the Berlin Wall came down and revisited it six years later. During that period, the infrastructure of East Germany had been transformed. The German Government should be applauded for having the guts to proceed with it. Germany continues to carry the burden of rebuilding the former East Germany. Similarly, in the early 1980s there was incessant criticism of the proposal to build the DART network from Bray to Howth. It took guts to build it, but today there would be chaos in its absence. We must take risks for the future and leave an infrastructure for the next generation. When I moved to Newbridge from Dundalk in 1955, there was talk of bypassing Newbridge, but nobody had the nerve to proceed. It took almost 40 years to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Technology is undergoing incessant change. Likewise, people in business must change constantly or they will lose out. There is a need to keep pace with infrastructure developments. The problems we face today are the result of hesitation over previous projects. It is the reason there is so much congestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Having been a public servant, I find that those who are most critical of the public service never worked in it. People should stop criticising the public service.</p>

          <p eId="para_602">I agree with much of what Senator White has said. It took almost 40 years for the Newbridge bypass to be completed. A late Fine Gael county councillor and business person, participated in a campaign in the 1950s opposing the building of the Naas bypass. I recall him saying in the 1970s or 1980s that he had lived long enough to be part of the campaign to stop the construction of the bypass and the campaign to build one.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">Anybody who has worked with public servants is aware of their dedication and commitment. The danger is that previous retirement packages, such as the one introduced in the late 1980s, were too rigid. Many people left under then, but eventually they were all replaced. The proposed cap on the overall numbers allows for more flexibility.</p>

Senators may have noticed how our colleague across the water, John Prescott – he is not a particular friend of mine but I sat with him through a dinner one night in the United Kingdom and found him most entertaining – is up to his ears in difficulty regarding the rail network and overruns in regard to grandiose plans. We can learn from the United Kingdom's experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The debate about tax illustrates the difficulties in trying to make changes. I recognise the benefit of having rules. Long before the budget I said I had come to the view that we should be stringent in regard to the country's finances. That is where I come in as those who have followed my political career know. I will not stray from it. The rules of good financial management are in place to keep us on the right path. We learned an expensive lesson when we went off the rails 20 or 30 years ago. It has taken a long time to dig ourselves out and I intend to stick to the rules for the duration of my period in office as Minister for Finance.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_618">In page 13, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_619">"3.–Section 446A of the Principal Act is amended in subsection (2) by the substitution of ‘€1,540' for ‘€770'.".</p>
          <p eId="para_620">We will not stray as far from the CPI as on the last occasion, although it was interesting, rather than pushing futile amendments as Senator McDowell says, to listen to the Minister elucidating on where we were and where we were going.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">This goes back to the controversial introduction of the concept of individualisation by the Minister. We remember the furore at the time. The perception was that it discriminated against the stay-at-home spouse looking after the family home or dependent or disabled relatives etc. The Government with skill and aplomb sent certain Members in a well orchestrated move out to the plinth – Deputy Marian McGuinness was one – to oppose the measure stridently. From the point of view of the revolt, the Minister responded quite positively by introducing a measure which gave an allowance of €770 to the stay-at-home spouse. It was welcomed and seen as an effort to address the imbalance in the allowances and concessions available to someone who goes out to work as against somebody who makes a sacrifice and stays at home.</p>

          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_623">Absolutely. The problem I seek to address in this recommendation is that the amount has not been increased. An increase is long overdue. That is the reason I propose doubling the allowance from €770 to €1,540.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_340" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_624">The intention of this recommendation is to double the home carer's tax credit from €770 to €1,540. It is estimated that to increase the credit as proposed would cost in the order of €72 million in the first year and €103 million in a full year. Given the resources available to me in budget 2003, I made only a limited number of changes in the personal tax system at a total cost of €186 million in a full year. Apart from the increase in the employee tax credit which is designed to ensure 90% of the minimum wage will continue to be exempt from tax, there were no increases in the generality of personal tax credits nor in standard rate bands. The budgeting position would not allow it. In the circumstances I am sure Senators will appreciate the reason I cannot possibly accept this recommendation which would be extremely costly relative to what was possible to devote to tax changes in this year's budget.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_625">This recommendation is obviously, as Senator Higgins said, intrinsically linked to individualisation which the Minister did nothing further to advance in the budget. Does he remain committed to the individualisation process? I have never been particularly in favour of it as, no doubt, he will have noticed. It did not appear in the Labour Party manifesto either.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">There are difficulties in regard to alleviating the hybrid situation in which we find ourselves. The Minister has done half of the job and left us with three levels. There was a distinct clear logic in what he was trying to do but he has only gone half way and introduced an anomalous situation which may be all right for a few years but which will not stand over a long period.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_342" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_627">I have gone more than half way. The increase of the first year was followed by the same increase in the following two years in which it did not attract the same attention. The figure for the single standard rate band – the more appropriate term – is €29,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">We have discussed the history and the furore on many occasions but it was not individualisation. It is probably better not to use that term. Individualisation means dividing everything, band, rates etc. This is the reason we have a standard rate band. The standard rate band for a single person is €29,000 and for a married couple, with one income, it is €37,000. I have gone up to that level but been unable to do anything in this year's budget to move it forward. It is still the goal of our policy and the agreed goal of the social partners to have a single standard rate band. The debate has moved on.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The Senator was quite gracious in what he said. I knew the Labour Party would not approve of it. I have noted that my former classmate, now Opposition spokesperson for the Labour Party, Deputy Burton, has not majored in this subject. I know it was a major issue for Senator McDowell who believes strongly about this area. I am aware his views would not be shared universally among the rest of the Labour Party. I pointed out when this started many years ago that for as long as I could remember the Labour Party activists always wanted some change in this area. It is still the goal of the Government and the social partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">In the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1997 there was a proposal for a home carer's allowance of £2,000 but it was recognised even then that there would be a problem in this regard. When I introduced what was known as individualisation but what is more correctly termed the widening of the standard rate band, I brought forward that proposal and introduced an allowance £3,000 payable at the standard rate which was then, I think, 22%. It has now been changed in tax credit terms to €770. I had intended waiting until the process was complete before bringing it into effect but I brought it forward then and have not increased it since.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">It is my intention to complete the process of having a single standard rate band on the basis of equity. I will not go over the debate again. I know Senator McDowell has different views on this issue, as have some people in my party. There are Deputies and Senators in Senator Higgins's party who support me privately and others who oppose violently. As I said in that great debate many years ago, I did not think this issue would set off such a wide-ranging debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_632">I remember that debate well. I am not telling Cabinet secrets when I say that I was one of the strong supporters of the measure. It is the mark of a true socialist when a person can be adjudged on their merits. The single standard rate band will be the proper conclusion when it is introduced. I thought at the time that the word individualisation had a selfish ring to it. It suggests that everything is about oneself. The single standard rate band is the correct way to apply it because each person has a worth and should therefore be adjudged on that worth. I always thought it was a fine measure and I said that on many occasions.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_633">That was an issue on which the tax strategy group, of which I was a member, was bypassed and wrong footed by the Minister. Nonetheless, I strongly support the measure. Perhaps, as the Minister half hinted earlier, there is scope for its extension to the social welfare system in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The change made then was a reflection of changing social reality. I remember being told by one of my children that no one under the age of 40 was in the Opposition camp. At the same time, people, particularly spouses who worked all their lives at home, were sensitive to the notion that their situation would be frozen. That was corrected after the budget and I support its completion. I am sorry that Fine Gael still seems intent on trying to reverse that.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">One must remember that the system then <i>de facto</i> discriminated against the second spouse at work who, more often than not, was the woman. If their spouse was earning any reasonable amount of money, they immediately went into the top tax band. That was actively discouraging. Economic circumstances today are such that most married couples in the younger generation need some income outside the home. That is tailored to the modern social reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">It is perfectly legitimate, as some columnists and politicians do, to regret the social change which has taken place. Undoubtedly, there are losses as well as gains. I do not dispute that. In the past 20 or 30 years children have had the benefit of a full-time parent in the home. However, that is unlikely to be the position for those born now. One may or may not regret that, but the reality has changed and the tax system must reflect that. I am glad the Minister is committed to carrying that through to completion.</p>

Such awards are normally made on a twin basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Let us consider the example of a person on maternity leave who wanted, as is her statutory right, to return to work and her employer refused to take her back. That person subsequently has recourse under the maternity legislation and an award will be made to them on two fronts: first, compensation for loss of earnings; and, second, in terms of damages. The normal tax regime applies to the loss of earnings and income tax deductions are made therefrom. However, awards for damages have been brought into the general scope of taxation. That is fundamentally wrong. When a person receives an award in court for injuries sustained in a road traffic or other accident, that award is not taxed. However, we are faced with a situation where the damages element of an award will be subject to tax. That is manifestly unfair and there appears to be a marked lack of consistency in terms of how the Revenue Commissioners apply the law.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_665">The recommendation seeks to exempt from income tax various types of compensation payments made to employees under the listed provisions in respect of discrimination, harassment, etc. There has been some publicity recently regarding the tax treatment of equality awards. In a recent article in <i>Irish Tax Review</i> it was incorrectly suggested that Revenue had changed its position and was now proposing to tax these awards. There has been no change in Revenue's view of the tax treatment of such awards. Revenue has always held the line that general awards of this nature are taxable under the Tax Acts. This is in line with case law where the courts have consistently ruled that anything received from being, having been or becoming an employee is taxable under Schedule E as part of the remuneration of the office of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The recommendation proposes their exemption unless a relevant authority, a tribunal, Rights Commissioner, the Labour Court or a judge, declares them to be taxable. This would effectively mean that such an authority would have absolute discretion, without any objective criteria, in deciding whether the payments were taxable. I could not accept this particular procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I am not convinced that the awards in question should not be taxable, particularly when one considers that we tax unemployment benefit. If payments of this type are to be exempt from tax, a statutory exemption will have to be enacted. Furthermore, such exemption would have to be considered in the context of the nature of payment of these awards. Many are settled out of court and often involve a global sum in full and final settlement of all actions. The element of the award relating to harassment, etc., would have to be isolated from any other compensation element such as, for example, loss of normal remuneration or from normal earnings.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">As stated when we discussed this matter in the Lower House, I am willing to give it further consideration. I will ask my officials and the Revenue Commissioners to investigate it in the context of next year's budget and Finance Bill. In the meantime, I cannot accept the recommendation.</p>

The Minister said unemployment benefit is taxed, but that is a substitute income for somebody who has dropped out of employment. Provided the person in question has enough social insurance stamps, they qualify for such a payment. This change has come about because a very perceptive inspector of taxes decided the damages element of an award should be taxed in the same way as the loss of earnings element.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The Minister's argument regarding unemployment benefit is not valid. However, I welcome his indication that he will take another look at this. That is a change in attitude from the position he adopted on Committee Stage and on Report Stage in the Lower House.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_677">In page 28, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), line 47, to delete “€8,000” and substitute €8,600”.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">The purpose of this recommendation is to introduce an improvement to mortgage interest relief. We have already strayed into the area of housing and housing policy. The burden being placed on first-time home buyers and owners is becoming increasing impossible. I am seeking to increase the limit for a married couple from €8,000 to €8,600 and in the case of a single person, from €4,000 to €4,300.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">These recommendations seek to assist first-time buyers. They looked at last year's budget and saw investors in the housing market getting, for example, a concession with regard to stamp duty which would cumulatively be worth something in the region of €12,000 to €15,000 on the capital cost of a house in Dublin city. Investors also got concessions in that they could claim interest relief on mortgages for the purchase of houses for reletting at the top marginal rate of 42%. First-time buyers, by contrast, got a very small concession and it only applied at the rate of 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">To exacerbate the sense of injury, the Minister in this year's budget introduced a number of measures which militated considerably against first-time house buyers. First, he abolished the first-time buyer's grant. It had not increased for a number of years but was relied on heavily by those getting into the housing market for the first time for the furnishing of one room or more or putting electrical installations in a kitchen. It made a difference and to wipe it out as something of no consequence shows a marked lack of appreciation of the difficulties encountered by young people and first-time house buyers. Despite this, it was abolished without warning in the budget. There was a public outcry and many are still aggrieved that this measure, a component that people built into their thinking with regard to putting together the money for a house, was done away with in one fell swoop.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The second imposition that the Minister introduced was the 1% VAT increase on house prices from 12.5% to 13.5%. The impact on the cost of building a house is dramatic. A huge burden is added in respect of the additional mortgage that must be negotiated by house buyers to get a roof over their heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The third measure the Minister brought in which militated negatively against the welfare of young people was the 50% increase in stamp duty on sites. That is the reason I sought to introduce some further margin of relief for the people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The extension of the period for which relief may be claimed is a measure that anybody could stand over in terms of trying to ensure that, for a guaranteed period, people would be able to enjoy the additional relief I seek to give them.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_684">I would be the last person to deny the underlying problems which Senator Higgins mentions. Getting young people into the housing market is a real problem. I hope one of the achievements of the Government over the next three or four years is the improvement of the affordability of houses. There is a sense of injustice in that it seems much more difficult for young people at roughly the same stage of life and in roughly the same occupation to get into the housing market than it was for people of my generation 20 to 30 years ago. In addition, young people see professional people with more money than they know what to do with investing in property and driving up house prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">My problem with this recommendation is that it would not be an efficient way of achieving what is desired any more than the first-time buyer's grant was. That had long since been absorbed into house prices, though it may have provided some psychological comfort. The house price is, unfortunately, related to what people can afford to pay. The doubling of mortgage relief would not necessarily increase the capacity of a first-time buyer to pay because the price and the loan would be lifted by a corresponding amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The changes made by the Minister were meant to mitigate and modify the effect of getting rid of the first-time buyer's grant. I accept the argument that they do not do this completely. On the other hand, the price and affordability of houses depend on more factors than mortgage relief and grants available. The Minister has spoken at length about what is needed to moderate and bring down prices, much of which has to do with supply and demand. If we can spread employment opportunities around the country, it will lead towards something of great interest to the constituency which I shadow, that of decentralisation.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_688">There are a couple of separate arguments but they come together to some extent. It was wrong to get rid of the grant, which is not to say I do not accept the Minister's general thesis that the grant was increasing house prices, which it was. However, it was being run into the price in terms of the full repayment over, typically, 20 years. It is correct to say that over 20 years the buyer would be paying €3,000 more than he or she would otherwise have paid. However, it gave him or her extra money at the point of purchase and provided for the deposit on a house or carpets and curtains. It was still of benefit up front, although over time the overall price of the house went up because of it. On balance, it was wrong to get rid of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">If the Minister's argument is accepted, the same argument applies to mortgage interest relief generally, as I am sure he knows. If people's capacity to repay is increased by subsidising their repayments over the first five years, they are encouraged to get higher mortgages because, typically, first-time buyers mortgage themselves to the maximum possible extent. That, in turn, increases their capacity to buy what is on offer at a given price. If the Minister follows the logic of his own argument, he should be, rather than increasing mortgage relief, looking to abolish it also.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">I think I have some idea of how the Minister works in these matters. He ended up extending mortgage interest relief simply because he was obliged to do so or because political circumstances put him in a position where he felt he had no other choice. I would be interested to hear how he differentiates between the two examples given. How can he justify getting rid of the grant while extending mortgage interest relief?</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_360" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_691">These recommendations relate to the enhanced ceiling on mortgage interest payments that qualify for tax relief which is available in the case of first-time buyers. Section 9 proposes that the existing ceilings be increased from €3,175 to €4,000 for single persons and from €6,350 to €8,000 for married and widowed persons. It also extends the period for which the higher amount of relief may be claimed from the present five years to seven. Senator Higgins's recommendations propose that the interest ceilings be further increased to €4,300 and €8,600, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Section 9, by making the improvements that it contains, recognises the difficulties faced by first-time buyers in current circumstances. It provides additional relief for those who have had to raise, or will have to raise, large sums for their first house. The new mortgage interest relief regime will mean that full interest relief will be available for a couple on mortgages of up to about €170,000. The most recent data available from the Department of the Environment and Local Government suggests that the average mortgage of first-time buyers is €122,600 nationally and €162,200 in Dublin. The increase in the limits on relievable interest provided for in the Bill is significant and I do not see that there is any need to increase the ceiling further as proposed in the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The estimated full year cost of the improvements for which I am providing in section 9 is €8 million. In present circumstances, that is as much as I am prepared to incur in improvements in this area. The abolition of the first-time buyer's grant was debated in the days between the announcement of the abridged Estimates and the budget. I announced the changes in mortgage interest relief incorporated in this Bill on budget day. Senators referred to the first-time buyer's grant, the VAT increase and the increase in stamp duty which applies to sites in certain circumstances. The latter charge is probably more relevant to Senator Higgins's county than to Dublin. Senator McDowell could have guessed some time ago that I intended to abolish the grant. If he re-examines the records of the debates at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, he will find that I mentioned that it was a total waste of resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_696">I mentioned during the debate on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 that when Senator McDowell was a Member of the Lower House, he said he enjoyed reading the tax strategy group's documents because he then knew what I would not do. I accept that the Senator and I differ in relation to the first-time buyer's grant which was not introduced as a sop to house buyers but as a means of reinvigorating the building industry which was on its knees at the time. It encouraged demand, brought people back into the housing market and helped the building industry. I agree with economists who suggest that it has been built into the price of houses and trousered by builders for a considerable time. It has been difficult to abolish it, as it has been with every other scheme. It is not easy to explain to individuals who thought they would be able to spend €3,800 on new carpets or curtains that they will benefit to a similar extent over a period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Senator Mansergh has read many fine articles during the years in relation to free trade. When Seán Lemass announced in the 1960s that Ireland was to join the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, he tried to argue that it would be good for everybody in the long term. When we joined the EEC in 1973, we had to argue that free trade would be good for everybody. It was hard to explain to workers in factories in Athlone, Mullingar, Athy and Kildare that went to the wall that free trade would be good for them in the long run. Free trade has been very good for the country and we have benefited from a larger market. It is hard to explain to people that, although they are suffering now, they will benefit in the long term. I can understand the reason an individual who is suffering would not appreciate the point too much.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The decision to abolish the first-time buyer's grant and increase mortgage interest relief will result in a more effective system than that currently in place. Senator McDowell has argued that there is no great long-term difference between the two approaches as the new benefits will be built into the price of houses. I could argue, as officials in the Central Bank do, that reductions in interest rates encourage more people to participate in the property market. One of the objections to a reduction in interest rates in Ireland which is part of the global market is that it would further stimulate the housing market. The independent central bank in the United Kingdom, under the governorship of Eddie George, has been quite reluctant to reduce interest rates in recent years, although it has changed its position recently. It has always referred to the effect of such a move on the housing market, which is understandable in the light of the upturn in the housing market there in the 1980s. One could argue, similarly, that reducing interest rates creates more demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The fact that people had more money in their pockets as a result of the boom and reductions in taxation meant that more money was available for purchasing houses. This resulted in inflation as builders increased prices when they realised that demand was greater than supply. The additional funds available to people also had an impact on the price of public houses. Young people throw their money across the counter in pubs and do not even bother to count the change. The price of drink in some pubs changes between 9.30 p.m. and 11 p.m. God be with the days when a publican in south Tipperary would have the same customers every night who would order the same three pints perhaps three nights each week. Customers would know the exact price of a pint and, if a publican increased his price by 2d, it would be the talk of the village and they would transfer their custom to another premises two miles away. Senators McDowell and Higgins will recall that when I reduced the VAT rate from 21% to 20%, following recommendations from the social partners, I said I thought it would have very little effect on the price of goods. I did not believe the reduction would be passed to consumers in a buoyant market with a high level of demand and I was right. I said I would keep it under review and increased it at the next opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_701">That is what happens when there is a high level of demand. The abolition of the first-time buyer's grant can be compared to interest rate changes but I do not think it will have the same effect. The new measure is targeted at the individual who will benefit when he or she completes the transaction by signing up for a mortgage and starting to make repayments. The new system which involves tax relief at source for mortgage interest relief will be far more effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">First-time buyers who do not purchase new houses, who comprise 15% of the total, will be in a stronger position as a result of the budget. VAT is not charged on second-hand houses. There is no stamp duty on such houses with a value of less than €195,500 and it is charged at a reduced rate of 3% on houses worth up to €254,000. There is additional value to a couple over seven years of new mortgage interest relief of €2,818. If one assumes an average purchase price of €179,000, first-time buyers will pay €1,591 of extra VAT but they will gain an additional €2,818 over seven years, giving a net gain. Without wishing to break the rules of Cabinet confidentiality, I am sure Senator O'Rourke will confirm that I would have liked to have abolished new house grants a considerable time ago. It was not a secret that I was trying to do so.</p>

A young couple in Dublin will have to spend as much money on carpets, a cooker, microwave oven or washing machine as a young couple in County Mayo. I can testify, on the basis of the experience of my siblings, to the fact that the first-time buyer's grant helped with such costs in no small measure.

          <p eId="para_713">They were relying on the grant and have suffered as a result of its abolition, irrespective of any later decisions on the part of the Minister. He may have breached Cabinet confidentiality today but did not do so in the run-up to the announcement of the decision. Those who had not signed a contract were caught and are still bearing the brunt of the pain of his decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The promise to introduce the £1,000 grant was probably the only sensible proposal in the infamous 1977 manifesto. It succeeded in swinging a considerable number of votes and seats and helped to give Fianna Fáil an unprecedented majority of 20 seats. It is simply untrue to claim that wiping the grant off the face of the earth is of no consequence. Senator Mansergh said it was an inefficient method of helping first-time buyers but I would like him to outline an efficient system that will compensate for this considerable loss. As far as young people are concerned, a grant is a grant, money in hand is money in hand and a relief is a relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Senator Mansergh made the point that the maintenance of the grant would cause house prices to continue to increase, thus necessitating larger loans. We are all familiar with the practices of the building trade in respect of reliefs and concessions, whether they are tax reliefs or grants. There is no doubt that they were gobbled up in many instances by unscrupulous builders who saw the grant as a neat device for increasing house prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">We have a major problem trying to enable young people to put a roof over their heads, not only in Dublin. Senator Mansergh mentioned the manipulation of the market by the building trade. It is patently wrong that six or seven large building enterprises can control matters by sitting on rezoned land banks for which they have got planning permission. They release these areas on a drip-by-drip basis to ensure market prices are kept high and inflated. The same problem is evident in rural towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">Something major will have to be done. The Minister should recommend at Cabinet to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that land banks on the periphery of every town and some villages should be built up by local authorities which would be fully serviced with a water supply, sewerage systems, telephone cables and electricity. They could be sold off at a reasonable price.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">One could not describe Ballyhaunis as a metropolis. The Minister plied his trade there for many a year.</p>

The Minister still plies his wares in Ballyhaunis. He is a partner in a thriving accountancy firm, Tynan Dillon and Company, which does well out of the local economy, and also sponsors a golf classic in the town every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">There is a need for a radical re-examination of the housing market. It is a big problem which has not been tackled. I intend to press my worthwhile recommendation.</p>

          <p eId="para_727">As we have only a few minutes left, let us broach the subject of special tax breaks and allowances. While I broadly share the Minister's view on allowances and incentives, I seek further clarification. Where there are deficiencies in development, the tax system is an appropriate way to encourage people to invest in areas that would not otherwise have attracted investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The Minister has made some announcements – I am not sure I would call them measures – to curtail various reliefs at the end of next year, including film relief. I am not sure what he is trying to achieve. I find it difficult to believe he intends to abolish the urban and rural renewal reliefs forever. They do have a role if applied in a discriminating fashion with particular policies and developmental aims in mind. Will the Minister state his intentions in this regard as this would be helpful for all concerned?</p>
          <p eId="para_729">As far as I know, the scheme in County Leitrim and the Shannon Basin is doing reasonably well, although there are some developments one would prefer not to see, as with the holiday schemes. The take-up has not been too bad. I am more familiar with some tax-led developments in the city and they have generally been good. I acknowledge that the £25,000 cap the Minister introduced some years ago was a very effective anti-abuse measure, rather than an anti-avoidance measure. Provided there is a particular developmental aim in mind and we look at the dead-weight effect, we should not abandon certain reliefs and say they are bad. However, we need to understand exactly what we are doing.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_730">The comments the Senator has made encapsulate my views on the subject. The purpose of a tax relief should be to encourage an activity that would not be encouraged otherwise. If it tips the balance in favour of encouraging somebody to engage in such an activity, it should be done. There should be a time limit so as to have the maximum effect. The danger with all tax schemes, as with grant schemes, is that they are brought in for a particular purpose but never abolished.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">I have introduced some targeted tax schemes this year. A somewhat controversial one concerned a small adjustment I made in respect of private day care hospitals. However, I am in favour of introducing them. The Senator referred to the rural renewal scheme, for which I claim credit. It had an extraordinary effect on some counties, particularly County Leitrim. The Senator knows that the attitude of the people in that county has been quite extraordinary, indicating that the scheme has had considerable benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">No Minister for Finance has introduced more incentive reliefs or closed off more tax avoidance loopholes. The most significant tax abuse I addressed was by way of a cap in my first Finance Act. When I introduced it, my officials were dubious but the measure had a beneficial effect—</p>

          <p eId="para_734">It is not. Some of the reliefs have been in place for over 20 years and it is time to bring them to an end. Those who benefit from focused tax reliefs are high income earners. We produced a report for the Revenue Commissioners indicating that a survey of such earners suggested that some paid only X% of tax while some paid none. That is the downside but the desired economic activity would not have occurred only for them. Those who benefit most from such economic activity are high income earners.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_752">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_753">That Seanad Éireann, noting that the proportion of the population in receipt of medical cards is close to an all time low; aware that the non availability of medical cards increases pressure on accident and emergency services; aware that a promise to introduce medical cards for 200,000 more people was made before the last election, condemns the decision to renege on that promise, calls for the immediate reversal of that decision and the introduction of a free GP service for all before the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">I thought about this motion for a long time. As Senators well know, I am good at making the sort of speeches which provoke severe opposition. I would like to speak about this matter in a slightly different tone, for I want to invite the Minister to engage with me and be slightly less defensive than normal. We can do this any time we want, and we will be doing it every six months for the next four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">There are serious issues of public policy involved in the health care debate. We are in danger of losing sight of certain fundamental issues and making wrong choices because of assumptions about what we are doing or what we have not done. I worry about many things, for instance, about the Competition Authority trying to enter into the debate by suggesting that an increased level of market-based indicators and competition or some such thing would improve the health service. I worry about the degree to which many people have capitulated to the ideological position of the Department of Finance that enough money is being spent on health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">We see ourselves as an outgoing people, almost half of whom live in a wonderfully healthy rural environment and have a wonderful stress-free life. Ireland's image to outsiders is of a wonderful island of reduced stress. For that reason it is important to state the reality that we are quite a sick country. I will cite statistics from an address given by David Begg, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in Galway in March 2002. At 65, we have the worst life expectancy in Europe, at 79, the second lowest life expectancy for women. We have the highest rate of premature death caused by coronary problems, the second worst cancer death rate among women, the lowest acute bed ratio, and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Obviously, I could simply attack the Government, but this country needs genuine intellectual engagement about how we are to provide decent health care. Before I finish, I will have a few things to say about the Government. However, I genuinely believe that the debate must move on from my shouting at the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin. That will not stop me from doing so, but there are issues to address, and I would like to go through them, for I am extremely concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The number of in-patient beds has fallen, even over the last decade. The reduction – less than 1% – was not significant. However, at the same time there was a 10% increase in attendance at accident and emergency departments. The two together suggest that a problem has arisen.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">There is a shortage of paramedics, medical specialists, radiologists and others. I know that action is being taken to address the problem, but crises are looming. David Begg says that 80,000 people suffer from heart disease. However, as the population ages, that figure could rise to 150,000 by the end of the decade. That would almost double demands on services. David Begg also makes the disturbing point that between 30% and 50% of people suffering from coronary heart disease require readmission to hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">I do not make these points to pretend that I have huge sympathy for the Minister's dilemma. I would love to be in the position to be faced with such a dilemma. It is time for the debate to move from election mode to a level that involves more serious intellectual engagement. If the House serves any purpose, it is probably to try to deal with matters of this nature in a rational manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The health service is excellent for those who can gain access to it. Two members of my immediate family required acute hospital services in recent years and both of them could not have been better looked after in terms of the quality of medical care they received. In the case of one of them, I do not believe they could have been provided with better care in any other country. We have good doctors and nurses, but the problem in the health service relates to access rather than care. Many people cannot access quality care because there is not enough available. In many instances, the care provided is excellent. For example, cancer services are extremely good but many who need them find that the provision of such services throughout the country is patchy nationally. That is why there are horrendously high levels of fatalities among women, for example. Not every woman who contracts breast cancer has the same access as others to good quality care. Where the care is available, it is of a superb quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The crisis of access manifests itself, in the main, through emergency admissions and the demand for accident and emergency services. It was no coincidence that in the last election the three largest parties in the State made proposals to deal with this problem. Each of them focused on the issue of medical cards. My party promised and remains committed to a GP service which is free to all. The proposal did not include free medicines, but free access to doctors for all patients. The latter would be appropriate and affordable. My only argument with the subsidised drugs scheme – which I, like anyone else in their fifties, use increasingly – is that it is harsh on single people on limited incomes. I have no difficulty with the scheme, in principle. The real problem is that limited access to an affordable primary care service is pushing people in the direction of hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Approximately one year ago, an extremely reliable authority said that between 90% and 95% of health and socio-health problems could be dealt with through a proper primary care service. As that authority in question was the Minister for Health and Children, I assume it is true. He also described quite well what people want from a primary health service, namely, that it should be community based, accessible at the time it is needed and capable of providing a full range of services. I agree with the Minister that this is what people want and need.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">Before the election, Fianna Fáil promised 200,000 medical cards, Fine Gael promised 500,000 and the Labour Party proposed something that was only one step on the way to its eventual goal. The tragedy is that the Government's promise – for which the parties comprising the Administration are responsible – has been reneged upon. As stated earlier, I could easily, and would be well able to, bash the Government. However, I am more interested in discovering what caused the Minister to decide that he had obtained the greatest amount of money possible for the health services from the Department of Finance this year. Within the envelope to which the Minister referred, the 200,000 extra medical cards had to be given a lower priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">In a Government of collective responsibility, decisions about overall envelopes of taxation and public expenditure are the concern of everybody in Cabinet. While it is easy to say that the Minister for Finance should do this or that, the reality is that he had to make decisions he should not have been obliged to make. He knows that Ireland is not spending as much on health care as do other countries. Based on purchasing power parities, we spend €1,500 per head on our health services while the Netherlands spends €2,000 per head. That means there is a difference of 25% in spending between Ireland and the Netherlands, which is the crunch point in terms of the Minister's envelope. I would like him to indicate why we have decided to spend 25% less on health care provision than the Netherlands, particularly when one considers that we are as rich as them. At a time when it is clear that there are huge needs, that is the choice that was made.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The Minister for Health and Children cannot tell me that a person with an income of €140 per week can afford to pay a GP or to pay €72 per month for medicine or that a married couple, both of whom are under 66 years of age, on an income of €202 per week can afford to pay for medical care. I do not believe anyone is of the opinion that these people should be obliged to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">I was correct to decide that I would not become involved in a discussion of an overly political nature. I want the Minister to address the issues of the priorities and choices of Government. He claims to be on the social democratic wing of Fianna Fáil. If such wings stand for anything, it is for decent levels of public expenditure and decent public services.</p>

          <p eId="para_768">I second the motion. I agree with Senator Ryan that we need to look at the way in which we deliver our health service. The health strategy deals with the current system, but makes no provision for radical reform. It permits the continuation of the health apartheid that exists in the system at present. I urge people to consider the Labour Party proposals as a starting point for a debate on reform of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">As the Minister is aware, the Labour Party proposes universal access to primary care and hospital services funded by universal health insurance. While the proposals are not set in stone, their implementation would constitute a radical reform of the system underpinned by funding to meet day-to-day expenditure. There should be major investment in infrastructure because a lot of the problems that have arisen are as a result of cutbacks in previous years for which we all have responsibility. We are now trying to catch up. A similar policy is being adopted now. This will create problems for the future. This is the 21st century and the time to create a modern health system appropriate to our modern economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The Government had a budget surplus last year of €5.4 billion in its current account. We should not be financing capital projects out of day-to-day income and expenditure. The Minister for Health and Children should speak to the Minister for Finance about financial policies. People do not pay for their houses out of a yearly budget and leave themselves without food. The Government's financing policy is one of the causes of the problems faced by the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">At the very least, the Government should have kept its promise made at the last general election to extend the medical card to a further 200,000. There should be free primary medical care for everybody. Only one third of the population is currently covered. How can the Government afford to give tax cuts to the well-off while it is short of money to extend medical cards to those who need them? There is also an issue regarding the closing of tax loopholes and ensuring all taxes due are collected properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The Government's approach to the economy seems to be stop-start without any continuous investment in the two most important Departments which deal with health and education. When money was available, it was given back to the better-off by way of tax cuts. Then as now it was those on lower income who were squeezed.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">During the last general election campaign I met a woman who told me that she could not bring her ill son to the doctor until she was paid. That is outrageous and it put her son's health at risk. Many parents face that dilemma. Older people on very low incomes can be above the income limit for a medical card if a spouse works part-time. They often must decide not to visit the doctor because of the cost involved. The long-term cost implication is that the care of the person concerned will be a greater cost to the health service in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I do not deny that there has been an increase in health funding as stated in the Government amendment to the motion. I appreciate the Minister's efforts in relation to the health strategy but he is working within the mindset of the present which must be reviewed, as Senator Ryan said.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">I note in a report I have received from Crumlin Children's Hospital that parents of children on kidney dialysis often spend the night on chairs because there is not enough room to fit a mattress on the floor of the cubicles. The health service is not acceptable. Those suffering from cancer are forced to lie on trolleys for days. Health inflation is running at 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The Government amendment mentions the issue of primary care. If the Government is serious, it should provide funding to allow the new unit in Balbriggan to open. I disagree with the comments made about investment—</p>

          <p eId="para_777">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p eId="para_778">To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_779">"– commends the Government for its unparalleled increases in health funding;</p>
          <p eId="para_780">– commends the Government's health strategy which is firmly grounded in the principles of equity, accountability, fairness and people-centredness;</p>
          <p eId="para_781">– recognises the Government's continued commitment as stated in the strategy, cogniscent of overall resource considerations, to extending medical card coverage to cover more people on low income, including targeted increases to ensure more children, in particular, are covered;</p>
          <p eId="para_782">– commends the Government on the publication of the strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, which sets out a blueprint for the delivery of integrated primary care services by multidisciplinary teams of health professionals, and for its work to date in implementing this strategy, including the provision of funding of €8.4 million for ten initial implementation projects around the country, each of which will involve putting in place an integrated primary care team;</p>
          <p eId="para_783">– commends the Government's clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, including:</p>
          <p eId="para_784">– continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people,</p>
          <p eId="para_785">– initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers-refugees and prisoners, and</p>
          <p eId="para_786">– the implementation of the NAPS targets relating to health."</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I welcome the Minister. Everybody in the House will sympathise with the situation outlined by Senator Tuffy but all is not perfect in the world. Medical cards were designed for and are available to those in society who most need them. There are eligibility levels which are means-tested. It is a wonderful system and a great service but it could not be administered in any other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">The Opposition argues that the number of people covered has dropped and I will not counter-argue because it is a fact but if the number of those covered by medical cards has dropped, there has been a rise in the standard of living and incomes for all of us. Today 1.14 million have medical cards. All of us in the Chamber are spokespersons on health for our parties. I am glad to see that health boards have brought their records up to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">I am delighted that a Fianna Fáil-led Government extended the medical card to the over-70s. The Minister also made arrangements to ensure elderly people would not have to leave the medical practitioner they knew and choose another from a list. They were accommodated and allowed to stay with the practitioner with whom they were most familiar.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">I ask my Labour Party colleagues what their grounds are for saying accident and emergency departments suffer as a result of there not being enough medical cards in the system. The charge is €40, not much more than the cost for a general practitioner. The co-op system will alleviate the pressure on the service which those who do not have medical cards are using. The co-op system will alleviate this and work in tandem with the accident and emergency service. I never thought it was in competition with accident and emergency departments. Let me quote from Dr. Jim Kent's feature in the <i>Irish Medical News</i> yesterday on the WestDOC service. It reads as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_791">I've been working for thirty years and have had to almost change the habits of a lifetime to start a co-op. However, the experience has been phenomenal and all the GPs who are in WestDOC are absolutely bowled over by the success.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">It is a wonderful way of life compared to what we were used to. You don't have to be going around like a nervous wreck wondering if your phone is switched on, are you in coverage, is there somebody to mind the phone, is the phone baby-sat?</p>
          <p eId="para_793">All those worries are removed now. You don't even have to answer the phone. You don't have to argue with anybody on the phone. Your family isn't answering the phone and being abused by people wanting to know where the doctor is.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The experience for patients [this is the important piece for me] has been equally positive. They think that this is the best thing since sliced bread and they compare it with their experience in casualty. Coming here, they get an appointment but when they go to casualty they wait for five hours. The difference is just unbelievable. They think this is fantastic . A lot of people said at the beginning that it was like a train leaving the station: ‘It's a wonderful idea but we are not sure if the train is going to go or not, we would like to wait until the train is actually moving before we jump on'. But, the train has now definitely left the station and we're delighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">This paints a very positive picture of how the co-op system will work. It gives a clear picture of change and how it is being embraced, not just by practitioners but by patients also.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Senator Tuffy referred to primary care. We are all aware that the health care environment is changing and moving at a pace where general practitioners will have to work as part of a multidisciplinary team. I referred previously in the House to the huge changes in the health sector. I welcome the Government's commitment to primary care. When launching the primary care strategy, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children said it was the only show in town. It is the only show in town which will continue to be the case while it has the Government's backing and commitment. I wish the Minister well with it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_398">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_797">I welcome the Minister. I am pleased to be given an opportunity to speak on this important motion. I appreciate the problems in health care in contemporary Ireland which are of great concern to members of the public. People come to my clinic to complain that their medical card has been discontinued. I find it difficult to accept that some cannot avail of the card. It is a matter of the utmost importance which the Government has failed to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The Government, through a series of policies, continues to undermine the provision of a fair and equitable health service for citizens. The current health strategy sends a clear message that the Government does not consider the health issue to be a priority. The non-allocation of medical cards to those most in need, people on low incomes, has a knock-on effect throughout the social services. It is having a negative impact on the efficient functioning of accident and emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">In order to understand the problems in regard to the medical card scheme as it currently operates it is necessary to explore the eligibility criteria. It is glaringly obvious that the current income eligibility limit is so low that only the poorest of the poor qualify. I witness this in my constituency office. The result is that those just above the income limit, who are surviving on low incomes, are trapped in a nightmare scenario whereby a minor medical incident such as a routine visit to a general practitioner cannot be factored into their daily budget. The Department of Health and Children failed to raise significantly the income threshold levels in the 2003 budget because those on lower incomes had increased incomes in recent years. The rationale behind this must be that those on lower incomes are able to afford to meete their medical expenses.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">There is no justification for increasing the income limit by €6 or 4.5% as the Government did. It is a sham. The paltry increase does not carry weight. It reflects the need for budgetary restrictions in health care spending. Given the spiralling costs in society, not least the current inflation rate of 5.1%, and the fact that wage increases have not kept pace with inflation, the reality for many families is that medical treatment has become a game of chance. Families just hope to get by without having to avail of necessary medical treatment or treatment in accident and emergency departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">The increasing cost of medical care bears out this argument. I visited the doctor last week at a cost of €40. Anyone who attends an accident and emergency department without a letter of referral from a general practitioner must pay the same amount. The result of this is medical neglect among a large sector of the population. The most worrying aspect is the medical neglect of children whose parents cannot afford to pay for medical treatment. In a society which has experienced the fastest growth rate in the developed world it must appear strange that one of the basic principles of human existence, health, and most alarmingly, the health of children, is being neglected.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The facts do not lie. Current medical card limits are so low that a husband and wife with two children will lose eligibility if their income exceeds €250 a week. In the absence of a medical card it would cost a parent €70 in total to visit the family doctor –€40 for the doctor and a minimum of €30 thereafter for the purchase of prescribed drugs. This would represent 30% of the weekly household income. This is a conservative figure, given that those suffering from long-term illnesses and parents with children often visit their general practitioner more frequently and encounter higher drug costs. For a single person just above the income threshold of €138 per week, one trip to the general practitioner and the purchase of prescribed drugs to a combined total of €70 would represent more than 50% of his or her weekly household income.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The plight of the people concerned has become worse as a result of the recent changes in the drugs refund scheme. In 2002, the Government increased the burden placed on those on low incomes who need to purchase prescribed drugs. Prior to August 2002, the income threshold under the scheme allowed people to claim costs incurred above €90 per quarter. Now they can only claim a maximum of €70 per month and there is no clawback.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Ordinary couples are struggling on a daily basis to ensure that they and their children receive even the most basic medical care to maintain their health. The Government has reneged on its promise to provide an extra 200,000 medical cards. The Taoiseach said it has been delayed. The scheme should be increased. I, therefore, call on Senators to support the motion and vote to reverse the current Government strategy on the allocation of medical cards.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_399">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_805">I am pleased to take this opportunity to speak on the Government's commitment to provide quality health care to all. Our commitment is clearly demonstrated through the record levels of funding invested in health in recent years within the framework for growth and reform set out in the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, a Health Strategy for You.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">This year we are investing almost €9.2 billion in the health services, which represents an additional €5.7 billion in funding, or overall increase of 162%, since the Government came to power in 1997. When the revised Estimates volume, published in February, is taken into account, the allocation for this year will be 12% above that of last year. The significant increase between the original Estimates last November and the revised volume in February has arisen not least because of pay increases connected with intellectual disability and the impact of benchmarking. Benchmarking will cost the health service this year approximately €185 million. That includes 25% of the benchmarking award plus the arrears. It illustrates how 70% of our budget is directed towards pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Senator Ryan raised the question of funding. Any intellectual engagement on the issue of health must acknowledge the significant increases in funding. While it may be argued that they are building on a historically low base, we can demonstrate improvements in a range of areas. When I last attended the House to debate the health services, I said the way forward involved a combination of investment and reform. This year alone, an additional €1 billion has been allocated to the budget. Following the revised Estimates volume, health spending should approximate to 8% of GNP. Before the revised Estimates, gross spending was approximately 7.93% of GNP, or a net figure of 7.63%, but that did not take account of the most recent increases between the original Estimates last November and the revised Estimates volume early this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The national health strategy makes clear the Government's commitment to health as a key priority area. It is a long-term programme, but it sets out a clear plan and vision for the future. In setting out such a comprehensive and large scale plan, it is inevitable that prioritisation of actions must take place. This is a seven to ten year programme and there is no magic, overnight formula for putting right all the deficiencies in the system. However, the strategy represents a clear plan for moving forward, which is based on a step by step approach to improving and targeting health services, maximising the enhancement of health status and, in this context, reducing inequalities in the system and building the necessary capacity to meet the growing needs of the population. It is in this wider context that the issue of the extension of eligibility must be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically eligible for a medical card because of a decision taken by the previous Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually by the chief executive officers in line with the consumer price index.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">A range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances, such as carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. The guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds them, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. The health board chief executive officers have been reminded annually by my Department and me that medical card holders should not be disadvantaged as a result of budgetary increases in social welfare allowances.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">A number of schemes provide assistance towards the cost of medication to those who do not qualify for a medical card. Under the long-term illness scheme, a person suffering from a number of conditions can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Non-medical card holders and those with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme can avail of the drugs payments scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €70 per calendar month towards the costs of approved prescribed medicine. The vast majority of members of the public who do not hold medical cards are entitled to this service. There has been a dramatic increase in the cost structure of the scheme – up by 50% to 60% in terms of volume and expenditure – since the change was introduced in 1999. I will obtain the figures for Members later. Many more have benefited as a result of the changes. For many it represents an important support subsidy of the cost of medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">The overall percentage of the population covered by the medical card scheme now stands at 29.2%, representing well over 1 million people. The drop in the number of medical cards has arisen partly as a result of the growth in the economy and employment levels. Between 1997 and 2000, we increased the numbers in employment by 300,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_817">Employment growth has an impact. If thousands more are at work, they go over the eligibility threshold and, therefore, lose their medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">My Department has requested the health boards to engage in an ongoing review of the GMS list. That exercise is nearing completion, with dedicated teams in the health boards working with the GMS payments board to quantify any discrepancies on the GMS lists. Health boards are also identifying the level of overpayments to doctors which may have occurred. When the full extent of the overpayment is known, arrangements will be made for the recovery of these moneys from the doctors concerned. It is intended that a national approach will be adopted and that there will be discussions with the IMO with a view to agreeing a methodology for the recovery of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Equity in health care is one of the principles on which the national health strategy is based and one to which the Government is committed in the implementation of the strategy and through service development across the board. The overriding necessity in relation to equity, as was well recognised in the work of the health group within the national anti-poverty strategy review, is the need for access to services. If equity is to be met in a meaningful way, services must be built up, waiting lists reduced and activity increased. Specific groups, such as children and those with disabilities, require targeted service developments to address previous neglect and unmet need. Equity is a broad brush across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">A broad strategic focus is essential to address these issues. No single narrow approach will address the real need for better and more equitable health care services for all. The issue of prioritisation arises in this context. Choices must be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The first national goal of the strategy, Better Health for Everyone, deals explicitly with the issue of health inequalities in Ireland. It sets out a range of actions specifically directed at disadvantaged groups and concerned with ensuring they do not continue to suffer most ill health. Following an extensive consultation process with disadvantaged groups, carried out under the auspices of the working group on the NAPS and health, NAPS, national anti-poverty strategy, health targets have been included in Building an Inclusive Society.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Actions to reduce inequalities include implementing a programme of actions to achieve the national anti-poverty strategy and health targets for the reduction of health inequalities – specifically, targets to reduce gaps in premature mortality between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups and between Travellers and the rest of the population. That is the reason we have devised, formulated and published a specific strategy for Travellers which we have funded accordingly. In talking about equity, we are getting to the core of the matter when dealing with lifespans of particular ethnic groups in society. They have a much lower lifespan than others and there is much inequality. We have decided to target these areas. In addition, there are provisions to eliminate barriers for disadvantaged groups, both in terms of making healthier choices easier and supporting them at community level to understand and access services. We also have specific programmes of action for groups such as Travellers, the homeless, drug misusers, prisoners, asylum seekers and refugees, all of whom have a real risk of poor health status.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Our targeted measures are far more effective than a global increase in income thresholds to allow a greater number have medical cards. I agree with the aim of providing more medical cards but if we are to get at some of the critical groups, we need to use this approach. Despite criticisms in regard to our approach to the homeless, we have for the first time brought medical services to the homeless, including general practitioners, mental health nurses and consultant psychiatry services. A multidisciplinary team goes out to meet the homeless in our centres. Previously, we expected the homeless to try to locate these services independently and separately.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Structured programmes are developing. We have comprehensive progress to report over the last five or six years in many of the drugs task force areas in regard to intervention programmes for drug abusers and misusers. There are high success rates in terms of rehabilitation and people returning to work compared with European drug strategies. Our performance in the eastern region compares well with that of our European counterparts.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The health strategy recognises that, important though it is, health service access is just one of the determinants of health status and that efforts to improve access must take place against the background of health supporting public policies in other areas. That is the reason it makes a commitment to the introduction of health impact assessment as part of the public policy development process and will seek to ensure the statements of strategy and business plans of all relevant Departments will incorporate an explicit commitment to sustaining and improving health status.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">Senator Ryan mentioned David Begg of the ICTU. I ask the Senator to use his influence with the ICTU to get members to embrace enthusiastically the idea of taking an increase in cigarette prices out of the CPI.

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_405" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_828">I have spoken to the ICTU. Even in the recent social partnership talks, the issue did not get a mention. It was fudged again. The health of workers is more important than the leverage 50 cent on a packet on a cigarettes gives the trade unions in trying to get pay increases in line with inflation. In 2000 the then social partnership agreement almost collapsed because of inflation going over 5%. The imposition of an increase of 50 cent on a packet of cigarettes in 1999 resulted in an increase in the CPI of about 0.8%. For the next year or two a barrier to increasing the price of cigarettes was the fear of undermining social partnership. I understand where the Department of Finance is coming from. We increased the price of cigarettes by 50 cent again this year. As a result of lobbying by me and others, the Minister responded with an increase. I hope people will begin to see sense on this issue because smoking is the biggest killer in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">Fair access, the second national goal of the strategy, is concerned with ensuring equal access for equal need is a core value for the delivery of publicly funded health services. The actions set out in the strategy will ensure all those eligible understand their entitlement, can easily access services they need and can be sure that, no matter where they live, there is a standard approach to eligibility for services. As part of ensuring fair access, the strategy identifies the need to ensure equitable access to services. This is primarily concerned with improved access to hospital services for public patients as well as recognising other barriers which affect people's ability to access services.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">The hospital system in general is experiencing increased pressure due to a number of factors, including the growth in population, the availability of in-patient beds and the increasing number of elderly people who have a higher than average length of stay. The pressure on the hospital system, in particular hospitals providing accident and emergency services, is more severe over the winter months.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">The Government has taken a number of measures designed to enhance accident and emergency services. A €41 million investment package was provided in the winter of 2000-01 aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. This provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the recruitment of additional accident and emergency consultants – 17 of these posts have now been filled. The recruitment process is continuing in respect of the remaining posts. The House may be interested to know that in 2002 there were 1.2 million attendances at accident and emergency departments, which represents a decrease of 1.5% on the number of attendances in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Comhairle na nOspidéal has undertaken a detailed review of the structures, operation and staffing of accident and emergency departments. The report entitled, Report of the Committee on Accident &amp; Emergency Services, not only deals with the staffing of accident and emergency departments at consultant level it also links reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows through hospitals. The report provides valuable advice on the structure of our emergency services and the necessary linkages which will be required to eliminate delays in emergency departments. The provision of accident and emergency services must also be seen in the context of a range of additional initiatives being taken by the Government to significantly enhance the treatment capacity of the hospital and community sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Following a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs, the Government decided in the context of the health strategy to provide an additional 3,000 public beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. My Department provided funding for the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards for the commissioning of 520 of these additional beds in 2002. A further 189 beds will be commissioned this year to bring the total number of new beds commissioned to 709, which exceeds the health strategy's commitment. These additional beds should take some pressure off of accident and emergency departments in that there will be extra capacity to admit patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I prioritised the issue. When I received my envelope in 2002, I said I would put increased numbers of beds before other issues. I put beds before the issue of the extension of medical cards. I believed it was critical and there was consensus in the debate on the issue. I am confident that hospital management and staff in hospitals providing accident and emergency services will continue to work together to respond to any difficulties presenting and ensure a high quality service is provided for patients in the best conditions possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">The national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, is being used to purchase treatment for public patients from private hospitals in Ireland or international providers where it is not possible to treat them within a reasonable period in Ireland. Here again we prioritised expenditure. Public patients waiting longer than 12 months or two years for treatment represent a core equity issue. To date, 3,337 patients have been treated under the fund. Some €31 million has been provided in 2003 for the NTPF, the target of which is to treat 600 patients per month. The fund is also getting to grips more effectively with the statistics behind the waiting lists. We have got some interesting returns in the lists we get from the health boards. Of the 11,000 on the long waiters' list in 2002, the number is now down to 3,000. Some of the numbers were reduced through validation, the process of offering an operation to a person and then discovering that he or she may have had it or no longer needs it. I can provide the figures later for the House. They are a sign of the progress we are making on the issue of equity and quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Health for disadvantaged groups is a complex issue which needs to be tackled in a number of ways. We must ensure first of all that people are healthier and are less likely to need health and personal social services and secondly, that when they do and once they are deemed eligible that no other barriers, such as transport or opening times, prevent them from accessing the services they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">In addition to these measures, while having regard to overall resource considerations, the Government remains committed to extending medical card coverage within its lifetime to more people on low incomes, including targeted increases to ensure more children, in particular, are covered. We restate that commitment this evening. Such actions always have to be considered in the light of the whole range of priorities which arise in relation to health services. Prioritisation must be carried out with a view to having the maximum effect on improving the health of all. The introduction of all the elements of the strategy action plan must also be considered in the context of the prevailing budgetary situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The strategy also recognises that extending eligibility will not guarantee that people get the services they need. There are other barriers in the system to equity and these have been prioritised to ensure that the eligibility framework in the future can support equal access for equal need. The strategy includes a series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF. These include: streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The health strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. A number of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services. Shorter waiting times for public patients are prioritised, with the expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of a treatment purchase fund. In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups, including: continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people; initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers and prisoners; and implementation of the NAPS targets relating to health.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The primary care strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, contains the template for the development of primary care in Ireland in the coming decade. Its key objective is to move from the current fragmented system of delivering primary care to one where services are provided by integrated, multidisciplinary teams. The primary care team will include general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, home helps and health care assistants. As the new model is developed, wider networks of other primary care professionals will also provide services to the populations served by the primary care teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">This strategy is being implemented on an ongoing basis. In April 2002, a small primary care task force was established within my Department to drive forward the delivery of the reforms of primary care contained in the strategy. The task force reports to a wider national steering group which includes representatives from primary care professional groups, unions, the community and voluntary sector and other key stakeholders and which will give national leadership and guidance as the implementation plan is rolled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">A national primary care conference was convened in Galway in October last year. It was the first conference organised at a national level to discuss, in partnership with the stakeholders, the implementation of the strategy. Translating the new primary care model into reality will require a partnership approach and the conference provided a forum for the key stakeholders to meet and discuss the main issues involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">In October last year I gave approval to the establishment of an initial ten primary care implementation projects, that is, one in each health board area. Funding totalling €8.4 million has been provided for this purpose in 2002 and 2003. I prioritised that in terms of obtaining money to get it started. The projects will involve putting in place in ten locations around the country a primary care team in line with the model described in the strategy. As the ten projects are developed, more than 80,000 people will benefit from having direct access to an improved range of services provided by their primary care team. The objective is to have these teams in operation and delivering an enhanced range of primary care services to their populations later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">The primary care strategy takes a long-term view. It is not possible to transform a health system overnight, nor would it be desirable to try to do so. Change will be achieved incrementally. The strategy recognises that there are many structural changes which must occur in order for the new primary care model to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">In the context of Senator Feeney's remarks, approximately €42 million has been allocated since 2000 for the GP co-operative, which provides a 24 hour, seven day out-of-hours service in almost all areas of the country, with the exception of Dublin. The co-operative in Dublin does not provide a 24 hour service; it tends to be of a shorter duration. That is something with which we must deal. We hope to move on that again this year, although we have made rapid progress. This will give a quality out-of-hours GP service to people across the country. That is an issue I have prioritised in terms of the allocation of funding. Access for mothers and people with children to good quality primary care in the middle of the night is as important in terms of access to services as income is in terms of getting the right treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">As we move forward, it will be necessary, at regional and local level, for existing primary care services to be restructured and refocused so that care can increasingly be delivered in accordance with the principles and the concepts set out in the strategy. The public and the providers of the services have told us what a modern health system should provide – a first class continuum of care, close to home and available around the clock. The primary care strategy provides the blueprint for that kind of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Last year was the first year of the implementation of the health strategy. In reviewing its progress to date, I am happy to be able to record significant progress on a number of fronts, including the development of capacity, developments in primary care, legislative developments, the restructuring agenda and so on. At the end of last year, up to 70% of all the actions detailed in the strategy had commenced. We also set out in 2002 to make a tangible difference to the experience of individuals in their interactions with the health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">Last week saw the launch of the results of the latest survey undertaken on behalf of the Irish Society for Quality and Safety in Healthcare into patient perception of the quality of health care. Interestingly, and contrary to much of the media coverage of this issue, the results of the 2002 survey are positive in many respects. Patients perceive the quality of the care and service received to be very high. Some of the findings mentioned in the survey include: the fact that 92% of patients reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the overall quality of care they received during their stay in hospital; 85% of patients reported being satisfied or very satisfied with the standard of service they received in the accident and emergency department and 90% were dealt with within three hours; 90% of respondents indicated that the explanations given to them by doctors about their condition and treatment were either very easy or fairly easy to understand; 90% of patients who experienced a procedure reported having it adequately explained to them; and 92% of patients expressed a high level of overall satisfaction with the hotel aspects of the hospital's service. Against a background of 95% of patients declaring themselves as being generally satisfied, the challenge now is to build on our successes and address those areas that require improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">I thank Senators for their contributions this evening. The Department of Finance presents Estimates every year to the Government. Debates take place on a bilateral basis between Departments. That has happened every year since time immemorial. The Department of Finance progressed issues this year in the context of existing levels of service. We received an envelope. It is interesting to note that of all the increases this year in all Departments across the public service, the Department of Health and Children received approximately two thirds of the full amount allocated. We got an extra 12% in addition to what we got last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">This year we prioritised GP co-operatives and the primary care strategy on the primary care side. As regards acute beds, we got the full year costing for the 709 beds because many of the beds would have come on stream later in 2002. We have also prioritised areas relating to the elderly and the heart and lung transplant unit in the Mater Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Every year tough choices must be made in health. One would appreciate a greater envelope. I regret that we are not able to extend medical card eligibility this year, but the funding envelope does not stretch that far. I want to get the other structural changes in place as quickly as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_406">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_852">I thank the Minister for an interesting contribution. I am sure he was as disappointed as Members when the other 200,000 medical cards did not materialise after the last election. I take seriously what Senator Feeney said about the improvement in our economic situation. However, Senator Feighan was right when he mentioned the incredibly low cut-off point for medical cards. It is €138 gross for single people. PRSI contributions may be taken out, but people at that level are still paying tax. The rate for those over 66 years of age is €151.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I welcomed the introduction of medical cards for those over 70 years of age. However, I said at the time that I thought it would be better if a lower income level was expanded to everyone. Why did the Department not realise that there were 30% more people over 70 years of age than it expected? That was extraordinary. I am glad the Minister is working on the GMS lists now because they must be revised. A sum of €20 a day is a terribly low income level. It is about half the cost of a visit to a doctor. As Senator Feighan said, for a married couple with two children it costs €250 which is appalling. One visit to the doctor costs €35 if one member of the family is ill. There is a huge poverty trap here.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The Minister has pointed out that various allowances are not taken into account such as the carer's allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, child income, family income supplement and foster care allowance and that there are special groups such as Travellers, the homeless, drug misusers, prisoners, asylum seekers and refugees for whom special latitude is given. There is a certain group who must wish they were not leading such upright lives because they cannot afford to take proper care of themselves and they just exceed the income level. The Irish College of General Practitioners has expressed concern to me about this group, who see doctors less frequently than they should. Often they self-diagnose and self-prescribe. Also they present less frequently for routine checks in the event of chronic illness and do not become involved in preventative health care and health advice which, as the Minister has said, is extremely important. They do not present with social and psychological problems. The longer psychiatric problems remain untreated the more likely they are to be serious. In their report on the stark facts the other day, psychiatrists pointed out it was those from the least affluent backgrounds who had the highest level of psychiatric problems and the least psychiatric services. There is a large group who are losing out badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">The current level of costs definitely affects those who attend accident and emergency services and the College of General Practitioners supports that claim, as do the accident and emergency consultants. It costs €40 to attend accident and emergency departments and it costs probably less to visit GPs, some of whom charge about €25. However, a large proportion of people do not pay in accident and emergency departments. It is much easier to refuse to pay the anonymous receptionist who has the misfortune of trying to collect the money or the strange doctor whom one is unlikely to see again than one's own GP, whose receptionist may be a neighbour. There is also a problem with people giving false names and addresses in accident and emergency departments when they cannot pay so that they cannot be traced. This is a serious issue which needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">I am pleased that so much more money is being spent on the health services. It is important that a huge amount of that money is spent on well-deserved pay increases for the staff working in the health services, but it is not of much benefit to the group being discussed here. The primary care strategy has been an excellent initiative. I agree with Senator Feeney. It is not just WestDOC that is pleased with the situation. I have not heard people from any of the co-operatives say they were displeased and at the same time single handed practitioners appear to be facilitated. All in all it looks good.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">A serious problem which all general practitioners encounter is access to diagnostic services in hospitals and access to physiotherapy, occupational therapy and so on. It would be cost effective if it was possible to reduce the number who have to be referred to a consultant before becoming involved in services such as physiotherapy or have much-needed X-rays.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">I noticed in the investigation into all the self-regulatory bodies a suggestion that people should be able to refer themselves directly to specialists in hospital rather than go through general practitioners as at present. Direct access to specialists, as in the United States, has led to its being the most expensive and least efficient health service in the world. It spends well over 14%, possibly 18%, of its GNP on a health service which serves only a certain proportion of the population. There are some aspects of our service which are not bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">That such progress has been made in the health service over the past 30 years is marvellous. I have been in practice long enough to remember the real two-tier system when there were dispensaries and those who could go to their own general practitioner. It is wonderful that everyone is served by the same people now. The extensions provided for in the primary care strategy are well worthwhile and I support what the Minister is doing. General practice is trying to do what it can in the area of preventative medicine but it is very difficult to get through to the general public that it would benefit. I was fascinated recently at the difficulty in getting people to have their children immunised against measles, mumps and rubella, which is a very safe vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">There are demands that the Minister have smallpox vaccination ready for everyone when the bio-terrorism strikes. America has already had one death as a result of it. We know that three in every million die from vaccinia even in the best of circumstances with smallpox. The <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> has published several excellent articles saying the United States would be better off if it tried to barrier nurse anyone who got smallpox and to vaccinate those who might be dealing with them, yet there are those here who say we must be ready to vaccinate everyone against smallpox. What would be the cost to the health service?</p>
          <p eId="para_861">I have a certain sympathy with the Minister who is trying to control spending in the right direction, but I suggest there is a group who are not getting the services they need.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonScanlon" eId="spk_407">
          <from>Mr. Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_862">I welcome the Minister to the House. In getting the economy back on line it is important to be aware that the health of a nation has a direct impact on its economic health. When one falls ill one has a reasonable expectation of quality service and care. We have a multi-tiered health care system, public, private and marginalised. The latter have an income just a little over the eligibility threshold for a medical card. What is required is a targeted extension of the medical card system based on need.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">The Irish Patients Association has consistently advocated the need for value for money in our health service. To secure that value the money must be redirected to other areas of need within the health care system and not returned to central funds. There is a need for more beds, consultants and investment in community care, more accountability, updated legislation for the Medical Council to meet the needs of the 21st century and better utilisation and standardisation of technology. In a commercial sense, what company would survive if for every factory worker there were three or more administrators or managers supporting them? We need efficiency targets in all departments to allow for the extension of medical cards, more beds and the provision of more consultants.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The Minister, Deputy Martin, would like to do more but managing the health system is a matter of prioritising issues. A whole range of services which had been scandalously neglected prior to 1997 have been tackled by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">I strongly support the provision of medical cards for children with disabilities. It is an area that needs to be addressed because such children need more medical attention. Some families who have children with special needs cannot afford medical treatment. I commend the Minister on the provision of medical cards to everyone over the age of 70. Tight budgetary constraints did not allow the Government to deliver the 200,000 extra medical cards this year. We must remember this Government has four years left in office and it will implement these measures as soon as it is economically possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">It is important to note that this Government cannot create a world-class health system over night. In the years 1995 to 1997 a Labour Party Minister for Finance raised health spending to more than €400 million. That compares to €4.7 billion since. We all accept the country has improved economically since then.</p>

          <p eId="para_874">Deputy Quinn stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Just over six years ago, when there was a different Government in office, concerns about the future of the medical professions, particularly the nursing profession, were communicated to the Government and the Opposition. Certain predictions were made about the changes that would occur, especially with regard to the number of people coming into the nursing profession and the availability of well motivated and qualified people in Ireland. I confess I did not listen to those voices at the time as well as I might have, and the problems the Minister for Health and Children now has are, in part, related to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">I congratulate Deputy Quinn on his honesty. They were difficult times.</p>

          <p eId="para_880">Many families who have children with special needs do not qualify for the medical card, a fact which is brought to my attention on a regular basis. I am sure other Senators and Deputies are made aware of it also. We must try to address that issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_419">
          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_881">The Labour Party has yet to find €20 million to invest in a communications unit that can trot out untruths and fallacies such as we have just heard. We shall continue without the kind of spin-doctoring that has surrounded this Administration for the past four or five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The national health strategy initiated by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was inspirational. It seemed to address every possible aspect of a very ailing health service. Chiefly associated with that strategy were the principles of fairness and equality. Senator Ryan quite rightly pointed out that a major plank of the three main political parties represented in this Chamber centred around the provision of medical cards. That was not a mistake at that stage. If equality in the health service means anything, it should mean people have access to services based on medical need and a capacity to benefit from that care. No other reason should determine how or why somebody accesses our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">Greater effort needs to be made in tackling of inequality in our health services. We heard for a long time that our health service was two-tiered, but we are now hearing it is multi-tiered. Those on lower incomes have been treated to the bottom tier of the health service for a number of years. I refer specifically to the public and private health service mix, one of the essential features in the financing and delivery of our health service. In other countries with a universal publicly financed system, parallel private financing through private health insurance plays a much smaller role there than it does here. The rate at which people here have availed of private health insurance has accelerated during the last couple of years. Almost half our population now have private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">Another element of the national health strategy was the emphasis on hospital waiting lists. Many of the concerns regarding inequality about which we have already spoken this evening relate to that issue. The data available on hospital waiting lists are limited in that only those on the lists for more than three months are being taken into consideration. That creates limited data because it does not take into account the actual number of people on waiting lists. We must put greater focus on those lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The vast majority of people who went to the polls last year believed this Government would extend the medical card scheme to an extra 200,000 people. We now know, regrettably and unfortunately, that that is not the case. It will not happen. That is something of which this Government will be eternally ashamed. It is wrong to give a commitment in a pre-election pledge that an issue will be tackled with great vigor and sincerity and then say when various Ministers take up office that we must tighten our belts, cut funding and do everything but deliver what was promised. That is precisely what happened and this Government cannot be proud of it. While some will say the Government is making inroads in that regard, regrettably, that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The Labour Party spokesperson on health in the Dáil, Deputy McManus, recently requested the Minister to furnish information regarding the number of expert review groups established in this area. That information was not forthcoming for five weeks. Deputy McManus then inquired of the Minister again. She was told there was such difficulty collating that type of information that it would not be possible to do it in five weeks. That tells us that many expert review groups have been established.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Are we lacking policy in regard to the health service? What we need is real action in terms of Government policy, not reports from expert review groups. We need policy that will deliver a health service on the basis of medical need, not what people can afford to pay for.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">The chief executive officer of the Children's Rights Alliance called on the Minister for Finance, prior to the budget, to extend the medical card scheme to all children and put forward a good case in support of that demand. The Minister for Finance, Cheltenham Charlie, should take cognisance of this request.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_889">The Minister for Finance is Cheltenham Charlie, though I have half a dozen other names for him. I am sticking to the text of our Private Members' motion. If the Government Senators think that children's health is a flippant issue that deserves nothing but snide comments and smiles, perhaps that is reflection of Government thinking with regard to the medical card issue. The manner in which Government Senators are behaving is pathetic and disgusting.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The point I was making is that there has to be somebody in the Department of Health and Children, or one of the other Departments, who can persuade Cheltenham Charlie that extending medical cards to children, in the sense in which it was requested by people in these organisations prior to the budget, is a good investment in terms of children's health. The chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children made that request of the Minister at that time, something that should and must be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">That we are debating in the third millennium extending medical cards to a wider population as a follow-up to a pre-election commitment speaks volumes about the manner in which this Government has treated the people. It is shameful, wrong and disgraceful.</p>

        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_421">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_892">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. The health service in Ireland is among the best in Europe. Those in this House and the wider community are aware of the problems being encountered but very rarely do we hear of the many stories of swift, efficient and successful treatment which takes place daily for thousands of people. Senator Ryan referred to this earlier and the Minister for Health and Children referred to recent survey results which bear it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">Investment in the health services is covered by a seven to ten year plan and the level of funding is phenomenal. When the budgetary position of last year is compared with the €970 million, or 12%, increase for this year – bringing the total to €9.2 billion – it shows the Government's commitment to improving, wherever possible, the service provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">The focus of the health strategy is correct. The emphasis on acute beds in hospitals and on primary care is the way to tackle the obvious delays in accident and emergency units. Some years ago, I was approached by a Ballyfermot GP, one of Dublin's busiest doctors. He suggested that a full primary care centre, based in the community and staffed by a team of GPs on a 24-hour basis, was the only solution to accident and emergency. He suggested that simple surgical procedures could be carried out on site and that available technology could be used to link up with a hospital where some patients would have records that needed to be accessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">I am delighted that a major part of the strategy is the establishment of 24-hour GP co-operatives with an allocation of €10 million this year for the development of centres around the country. This will go a long way to freeing up beds in many of the hospitals which, in some cases, are being needlessly occupied.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">The area that has probably benefited most from improvements in the medical card scheme is that of services for older people. There has been phenomenal change in this area in the past five years. I welcome the Minister's recent announcement of the commencement of public private partnerships for community nursing units for older people in the eastern and southern health boards. This will greatly increase the number of long-term care beds for older people, taking pressure off the hospital sector where, everybody agrees, there is undue pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The problems encountered in vast areas of the service are ones of frontline management as opposed to resources. This Minister has taken huge strides to tackle this, as have previous Ministers. The level of consultation and discussion between the Department and the service providers is unprecedented. I do not agree with Senator McCarthy that there should not be expert groups and that we should not talk to people on the ground. That is the only way to tackle these problems. Initiatives such as the waiting lists and winter initiatives, the treatment purchase scheme and the national cancer strategy are all a result of close contact with the people working on the ground. This progress will be maintained and enhanced and I am sure the Minister will succeed in dealing with the many issues which arise in this complex and important area.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I contacted the Medical Services Payments Board out of curiosity today. The figures it provides are startling. Almost €360 million was spent on the GMS service in 1997. In 2001, €635.739 million was spent, a huge increase despite the fact that the numbers claiming had reduced, as the Minister pointed out, mostly due to economic success.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">Senator Feighan mentioned the drugs payments scheme. In 2000, the number of people covered under that scheme was 942,000. In 2001, that has increased to 1.1 million at a cost of €177 million. These figures point to the total commitment of this Government. It is a long-term plan. The issues, as the Minister pointed out, must be tackled on an individual basis, one after the other, and that is how it is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">For the information of Senators on the other side of the House, I will quote from the excellent publication, An Agreed Programme for Government. The only mention of medical cards in the manifesto is as follows:</p>
          <p eId="para_901">We will extend medical card eligibility in line with the recommendations of the national health strategy and, further, review cases for the extension of both the medical card and the long-term illness scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">The plan is in place and under way. I commend the Minister and his Minister of State on the progress made so far. I fully support the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_905">I am delighted to speak on this motion. I regret that the Government has learned nothing from the fiascos experienced lately in the health services. The Minister still talks of a record level of funding. Money is neither the solution nor the problem. The Government has quadrupled spending on health recently but the necessary result, drastic reform of the health services, has not been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">I was amazed to read in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> recently that the Department of Health and Children spent a huge amount of money kitting out the Minister's offices. I can now understand the reason for that; it was because of structural damage due to all the reports stuck on bookcases in the Department. I would love to put down a question under the Freedom of Information Act, while I still can, on how many reports are sitting on bookshelves in the Department of Health and Children. It must be an astounding figure. There are reports about reports and expert review group reports about other expert review groups. The Minister might arrange a tour of the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_908">I would love to see all the reports. I know the Minister has a background as a barrister and is well able to read. Even so, there is no way anybody could get through them all. Politicians are here to cut through the red tape and reports and take action on different topics.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">Prior to August 2002, the threshold for the drugs refund scheme allowed people to claim back any costs over €90 per quarter. Under the new drugs payment scheme, people pay up to a maximum of €70 per month and there is no claim back, which has a major effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">There was a fiasco in the Department of Health and Children recently when it granted medical cards to over 70 year olds. It sounded like a great idea but the Department had not done its research and totally underestimated the number of people in that category. It is time to reappraise our view of what constitutes an old person. People are living for longer and I do not believe that someone aged 70 can be considered old anymore. Medical cards should be targeted where they are most needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Medical cards are given to everybody in the United States. This is not necessarily done to provide all persons with free GP care, but it is useful because cards contain information about people's medical history. The Department of Health and Children should consider introducing such a system here, as it would be very beneficial if information such as X-rays and details of medical problems could be stored on a card. If one were involved in a car accident or other emergency, medical personnel in accident and emergency departments would be able to provide treatment in line with one's medical history if they could locate the medical card in one's wallet. The Minister for Health and Children should examine this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">It is right that medical cards should be targeted at children. A key element of Fine Gael's election manifesto last year was that such a measure should be phased in. I realise that granting everyone a medical card would not work and would cause further chaos.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">Doctors have expressed concern that people with medical cards are availing of drugs that they are not necessarily using. Is it true that such people have a vast supply of unused drugs? Can the situation be rectified in any way, given that it is costing the State quite a lot of money? I do not know what the ideal solution is, but we need to provide medical care for those who need it most.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_427">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_914">I thank Senator Browne for sharing his time. I support the Labour Party motion. The Minister for Health and Children's speech was provocative and will anger most people who will read and analyse it. The jargon he used shows how out of touch he is. His recent actions indicate that his hands are tied, perhaps because he is being constrained by the Minister for Finance. We have been told on many occasions that substantial additional funds have been provided in the health sector. If the problem is not mismanagement, it must be that the Minister is unable to run an efficient health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The essential aspects of the Labour Party motion are quite clear. The fact that equity does not exist within the health system, although the Minister for Health and Children has said that it does, is exemplified by the problems with the medical card scheme. The Minister referred to the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, a Health Strategy for You, but I wonder what people who are in need of health care think of such a commitment. He said that the health strategy sets out "the Government's commitment to health as a key priority," but if that is the case, why are waiting lists increasing in all sectors? In light of the decrease in the number of people who are eligible for a medical card, I ask the Minister to indicate clearly and immediately the largest categories of expenditure in the health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">An increasing number of people suffer from asthma, coeliac disease and cancer. If people with such illnesses are guaranteed automatic access to medical cards, we will go a long way to allaying the crisis that exists. The discretion of chief executive officers in cases where medical evidence indicates a need for a medical card is, in effect, restricted as they have to operate within certain guidelines. They do not have the liberty to use their discretion fully. The Minister passed the buck, in relation to the provision of medical cards, to the chief executive officers of the health boards. Those officials do not have the discretion to set the guidelines. It is important that a total review of the medical card system takes place, specifically dealing with the categories I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">Given that 2003 is the European Year of People with Disabilities, I ask the Minister for Health and Children to declare immediately, as a gesture of goodwill, that every person with a disability will be entitled to avail of a medical card, regardless of the income of their parents or spouse. Everyone is waiting for the Minister to publish the medical manpower report, a draft form of which has already been leaked. We have been led to believe that the Minister has received the document and is revising it.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_432">
          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_922">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. If the Minister, Deputy Martin, were here I would congratulate him, as I did a couple of weeks ago, on the fine job he is doing in the Department of Health and Children. He has the most difficult portfolio because, no matter what he does and no matter how much funding he allocates to any group in the health sector, our good friends in the Opposition will tell him he is not doing enough. Perhaps they are justified in doing so, as one can never do enough in terms of funding in the health area.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Senator Tuffy said there should be a new focus on the implementation of health policies. The Minister for Health and Children has taken the bull by the horns by placing a new focus on health in terms of value for money. People have started to believe the old adage that no matter how much one throws into health, it will not be enough. It has become accepted that one cannot go wrong when allocating funds to the Department of Health and Children, as it did not have enough to start with. The original funds were never followed through the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">As someone who works in the financial end of the health sector, I can confirm that there has been a great deal of wastage in the sector since the 1970s. If it were being run as a going concern or as a commercial organisation at that time, it would not have lasted three months. Money which was badly needed in the health sector was focused in the wrong direction in many instances and wasted in other instances. That has changed.</p>

          <p eId="para_929">The Labour Party motion before the House highlights the medical card issue, which is a small element of care, albeit an important one. The health system is not about one element of medical care, but about the entire structure. The funds spent in the health system should bring about a package that caters for the needs of all people, not just a certain segment of society.</p>

          <p eId="para_940">A sum of €9.2 billion is being spent on health in 2003. As the Minister said, that represents an increase of 162% in the past five years. It is approximately 7.9% of GNP, a figure subject to revision when the Revised Estimates from December are taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">People have benefited more from sustained funding in the past four years than in the lifetime of any Government. Staff numbers have increased from 68,000 to 96,000. I would not necessarily hail that as one of the greatest feats in the world because some of those staff should never have been appointed in the first place. A small percentage of them, not all, comprise another layer of bureaucracy in the health system and I deal with them on a daily basis. I am delighted to see that the new health structure is being examined with a view to changing it. Some staff are falling over each another trying to find positive things to do.</p>

Nobody is denying that there are still major problems in the health sector. When we are being put in the ground, it is probable that Senators will still be talking about such problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">I listened to Senator Ryan talking about our being a sick nation and I have to agree with him because the total number of people treated in acute hospitals increased by 6% from 2000 to 2001. Almost one million people were treated as in-patients or day patients in 2001, the highest figures ever recorded. We must be a fairly unhealthy nation given that almost one third of our population of 3.8 million is being treated. However, we can still find the means of providing a fairly decent service compared to other countries.</p>

A sum of €44 million is being spent on the treatment purchase scheme in 2003. I heard the Minister refer to this scheme, which is working well. We saw a programme on television a month or six weeks ago that highlighted its benefits and showed a guy returning having had treatment. It is envisaged that we will be treating about 600 people per month through that scheme. It might not be the most desirable way to do it, but the bottom line is that they are being treated, and treated well.</p>

          <p eId="para_951">Senators on the Government side have trumpeted the extent of spending on health in recent years in defence of their position. A sum of €520 million was signalled in the recent Estimates, bringing the gross health allocation for this year to €8.9 billion, but it remains the case that the health service is under-funded. As a result, the national health strategy, welcomed widely on its publication, cannot be implemented. It alone would cost approximately €1.2 billion to implement and this sum is simply not being made available. Therefore, the increase in health spending by the Government is insufficient to meet its targets and commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">This results in the closure of wards and beds are not available, particularly in the ERHB area and in the acute hospitals in Dublin. We are made aware of the extent of the crisis in the Dublin hospitals on a weekly basis, particularly in respect of beds. Seven hundred new beds are being commissioned but 3,000 are needed, a point accepted by all sides. The need is not because of a massive increase in population, although this has been the case particularly in the east and probably should be taken into account, but because we are still playing catch-up because of the massive cutbacks of the 1980s. This was referred to only recently by media commentators.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Senator Kett suggested that the commitment to extend eligibility for the medical cards was to be honoured over a period of four years. When is it likely to happen? The Taoiseach has told us it will not happen. It was mentioned in the Fianna Fáil manifesto but Senator Brady has said that it is not in An Agreed Programme for Government. Clearly, while Fianna Fáil promised to extend eligibility in the pre-election period, along with many other things, this promise was watered down considerably by the time An Agreed Programme for Government was put together. By the time Deputy Michael McDowell had finished putting up posters in Dublin South-East and sat down to hammer out the programme, the commitment had been affected severely.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">The ordinary person in the street is suffering as a result of the Government's failure to honour its commitments. Recently, I and other Senators have encountered pensioners under 70 who do not qualify for a medical card, which is disgraceful. People on average incomes cannot afford to bring their children to the doctor or buy medicines for them. This forces them to go to accident and emergency units, probably clogging them up as a result. People on average incomes who cannot afford the full cost of a GP or a prescription find themselves in more serious circumstances when ill. That is only touching the surface. It is symbolic of the growing inequity in the delivery of our health services. Access to the health service, which should be a right, has been considerably diluted by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_957">Senator Feighan wanted to know how the low level of eligibility for medical cards affects accident and emergency services. It is very simple. When people who become ill cannot afford to go to their GP for treatment, they go to an A&amp;E service. If they could receive treatment from their GP, it would prevent them from having to go to hospital. It is the simplest thing in the world. That Fianna Fáil's leading speaker in this debate does not know that is as good an illustration—</p>

          <p eId="para_959">—that Fianna Fáil lives in a cloud above reality, reading speeches and using information provided by its €20 million a year spin doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">The Minister for Health and Children mentioned the primary care groups. Who would argue that they are not a great idea? However, to cater for 80,000 people – the word in the script was "client", but he corrected it to "people"– costs €4.5 million per year. To do it nationally would cost €250 million a year. Did anyone say we were going to do it nationally? The people are fed up with the Minister's programmes, plots and pilot groups. They want a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">The issue raised in this debate was the medical card system. I believe, as the Minister says he does, that between 90% and 95% of health problems can be dealt through the primary care system. We want is to ensure it dealt with this way because that is what people want. It does not have to be a medical card system.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Apparently, €138 a week is the income threshold which we as a community believe makes a person rich enough to pay €45 to attend a GP and €70 a month, at a minimum, on medicines. There is a restaurant nearby that charges €138 for the starters for two people.</p>

          <p eId="para_965">It was one of Fianna Fail's previous leader who developed the joys of spending public money on expensive restaurants and he told them all about it. Fianna Fáil Senators claim that this threshold of €138 is not a priority. The most fundamental priority is to enable people to attend their GP when they are ill, not when they have money in their pocket. If Fianna Fáil does not understand that this is the fundamental platform for a good health service, it will never reform it. It cannot do it anyway if it does know what people require.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">The myth that there is no money to do things now is precisely that. If I needed to do an emergency job on my house, it would not stop me sending my children to the doctor. I would borrow the money to pay for it. That is what sensible people do. The idea of funding a massive infrastructure programme out of current revenue is ideological nonsense, carried on by a Minister for Finance who is out of control. He leaves the country to follow the racing at Cheltenham and returns to tell us we are overspending. This is extraordinarily and intellectually offensive. This is the fundamental problem with this debate. The Government refuses to engage with the issue and, instead, produces a collection of nonsensical claims that does no service to itself or to this House.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matter. - Child Abuse.</heading>
        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_461">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_971">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. I raise an issue of great concern to many, including the Leader.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">We have learned this week that children who may have been sexually abused have to wait for up to seven months for assessment. A child who is deemed a priority case will be assessed at Crumlin or Temple Street Hospital where they will be seen within three months. In a recent newspaper article, a general practitioner who is a member of the Eastern Regional Health Authority expressed his great concern that children could be left in such a distressed state for so long. The protection of the child must be the priority and we are not serving children by forcing them to wait so long before being assessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">I would like the Minister of State to tell me the problem. Is there a shortage of child psychologists, child psychiatrists and social workers? I ask the Minister to address the fact that recent cutbacks have meant that positions in these areas which become vacant are not being filled. We could find in six months time that the waiting lists are even longer. I have asked a colleague in the other House to put down a parliamentary question to discover how many children are on the lists at present. If vacancies remain unfilled, circumstances will become more serious. The problem is at its worst in Dublin and the difficulties are not necessarily reflected throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">The matter is one of great concern and I am pleased the Leader has waited to hear the Minster of State's response. We are all concerned primarily with the protection of the child, which is why we should ensure that no child or family fails to get the treatment they need. I hope the Minister of State will be able to inform me that this issue is being addressed by his Department and that circumstances will change.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_462">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_975">I thank Senator Terry for giving me the opportunity to discuss waiting times at St. Louise's assessment and treatment service at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin. I am in a position to respond to the matters raised by the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">St. Louise's unit is one of two units in the eastern region where children are assessed and treated following an allegation of sexual abuse. Children may be referred from a variety of sources, including general practitioners, social work services and accident and emergency departments. The Eastern Regional Health Authority is very aware of the need for services in the assessment and treatment of child abuse to be as responsive and integrated as possible. In any case of suspected child abuse, the priority is child protection, followed by referral for appropriate assessment and therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">Referrals to St. Louise's assessment team are prioritised on a case by case basis with special consideration being given to children aged five and under, alleged assaults which have taken place within the last 72 hours and children who present in extreme distress. These cases are placed on a priority waiting list. Due to the number of referrals to the unit which meet these criteria, the waiting time is approximately three to four months. Referrals which do not meet these criteria have an approximate waiting time of seven months. There are currently 44 referrals awaiting assessment where all information has been received and another 24 referrals are being processed. These are awaiting further information such as case conference reports, medical reports, Garda reports and health board reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">Referrals to the therapy team are also prioritised on a case by case basis depending on clinical needs. Priority is given to children in extreme distress, presenting as mood disturbance or suicidal ideation, and to victims of acute assault. There are ten cases on the waiting list and another 11 are being processed which have an approximate waiting time of five months.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">Where St. Louise's indicates there will be a waiting period for assessment and where there is concern for the child in the interim, a number of dedicated counselling services have been funded through the three relevant area health boards. These services address direct crisis referrals for children and their families. Examples include CARI, the Daughters of Charity family centre, and the Mater Dei counselling services. The Eastern Regional Health Authority acknowledges that ideally these young children and their families should be seen from the outset by dedicated child abuse assessment teams and that this work should take place in an integrated multidisciplinary setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">I understand from the authority that the main reasons for the increased waiting times are the expansion of the service to include treatment as well as assessment, changes in familial structures which necessitate an increased number of interviews as part of the assessment process, significant numbers of custody and access related cases and the amount of time which staff are required to spend on court work. The authority considers a waiting time of seven months to be unacceptable and has initiated a detailed review of the current resources at St. Louise's and other relevant services in order to determine what action is required to provide a service more responsive to the needs of these young children and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">The Eastern Regional Health Authority indicates the review, which will include consideration of St. Clare's unit in Temple Street Hospital, will appraise current services by addressing referral, assessment and treatment processes. The initial analysis will also consider associated waiting times and numbers. It is acknowledged that these services cannot be looked at in isolation from the wider context of sexual assault service provision, including opportunities for alternative service provision and reference to best practice elsewhere. The terms of reference, including the timeframe for the review, are currently being finalised. A progress report on the review will be provided by the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority at the next board meeting on 3 April 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">Some preliminary work on the review has already been commenced by the researcher involved. A steering group consisting of representatives of the area health board, the hospitals and Eastern Regional Health Authority is being established. Interviews are being held this week to fill two vacancies in St. Louise's and additional consultant hours are being made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">Regarding the overall issue of child protection, a sum in the region of €70 million in additional revenue funding has been made available to the Eastern Regional Health Authority since 1997 for the development of child care and family support services. The eastern region has experienced difficulties in recruiting social work staff in recent years. Due to recruitment and retention initiatives, the area health boards are reporting much lower levels of vacancies. They continue to make every effort to fill vacancies from existing panels and continuing recruitment campaigns.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">I assure the Senator that I will monitor the situation closely. I am urging the Eastern Regional Health Authority to complete its review as early as possible and I am committed to ensuring that the current waiting times are shortened.</p>
