          <p eId="para_18"> By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.

          <p eId="para_19">They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. The opening statement and any other document submitted to the committee may be published on its website once the meeting has concluded. </p>

As they are aware, the committee earlier considered the general scheme of the Planning and Development (No. 1) Bill 2014 and we will revisit the legislation. The delegates' appearance before us is, therefore, timely and I look forward to hearing their views and recommendations. I invite Ms Hughes to make her opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_3">
          <from> Ms Mary Hughes<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">I thank the Chairman and members for giving us the opportunity to brief the joint committee on some of the challenges facing the planning system and planning professionals in ensuring Ireland has a consistent and transparent planning system that is fit for purpose for the next 50 years. Good planning ensures we get the right development in the right place at the right time. It makes a positive difference to people's lives and helps to deliver homes, jobs and better opportunities for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> I am accompanied by two Irish Planning Institute board members, Mr. John Spain and Mr. Henk van der Kamp, and its executive director, Mr. Seán O’Leary. We submitted to the committee a briefing note detailing three pertinent issues we wished to discuss. I hope the note provides an effective overview of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> By way of background, the Irish Planning Institute was founded in 1975 and will celebrate its 40th birthday next year. It is the all-island professional body representing the majority of professional planners in Ireland and Irish planners working abroad. The institute's mission is simple, namely, to advance planning and ensure we have a planning system that is fit for purpose and operates in the interests of the common good. </p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I propose, first, to outline the reasons the Irish Planning Institute seeks to continuously raise the standards of planning and the planning profession and professional recognition of planners is important and necessary. We need a planning system in which members of the public can have confidence. This cannot be achieved without a system that is transparent and credible. Planning is a uniquely participatory process. Members of the public, planners, councillors, architects, engineers, developers and local authority managers all have roles to play in the planning process. However, these roles are not clear to the public and are sometimes conflicting. </p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The term "planner" is randomly used to label and describe all those involved in the planning process, including administrators, lobbyists and members of other professions. This clearly demonstrates that the role, purpose and function of the professional planner are not fully understood, even in some cases by those working within the planning system. We need to repair trust in the system, but this cannot be done without first clearly defining those who work within it. The planning (No. 2) Bill provides an opportunity to create greater clarity around the title of "planner" and emphasise that professional planners are suitably qualified. Such clarification is necessary to ensure members of the public are not misled into believing they are dealing with individuals describing themselves as something they are not. As competent authority under the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, the Irish Planning Institute is engaging with the Department on fulfilling our obligations to regulate the planning profession. </p>
          <p eId="para_26"> The second issue I propose to highlight is the need for certainty and consistency in the making of plans and decisions. This is necessary to increase confidence and facilitate investment in development. Ultimately, investors need to know how long the planning process will take, the cost of securing planning permission and whether planning permission that has been secured can be implemented. Much development in previous years was project-led. It is critical that we maintain and promote deliverable plan-led development. </p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The Irish Planning Institute calls for the planning system and our vision for growth to be underpinned by the successor to the national spatial strategy. A new national planning framework, setting out a spatial vision for the country, is required as a matter of urgency. It must focus on promoting the country's assets and achieving synergies to maximise the potential of the different parts of Ireland. The optimal use of different parts of the country needs to be spatially highlighted. The proposed Government planning policy statement on the aims and purpose of the system is also urgently required. </p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The final issue we propose to address is the detailed mechanics of the planning system, some of which are likely to be amended in the forthcoming planning (No. 1) Bill. The planning system in Ireland has rigorous timelines and is uniquely participatory. However, as with most systems, there is always room for improvement. For example, An Bord Pleanála's 18 week statutory timeframe needs to be reassessed. Part V negotiations and agreement on the provision of social housing need to be more effective and should be afforded statutory timelines binding on the relevant local authority and developer. Submissions on compliance with conditions need to be effectively dealt with and a statutory timeline afforded to their consideration. </p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Other issues and mechanisms must also be considered. For instance, consideration should be given to the introduction of certificates of lawfulness of use or development instead of the current section 5 declarations. Furthermore, strategic development zones' planning schemes should be subject to annual review to ensure they can be implemented. </p>
          <p eId="para_30"> The responsibility does not solely rest with the overseers of the planning system. If the system is to work effectively, consumers must also adapt and show flexibility. The system must adapt to changing circumstances and trends and, above all, increase standards. Developers must be flexible to adapt their developments to ensure the best possible scheme can be implemented to best suit current and future populations. </p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The planning system can help to underpin economic recovery, without fear of repeating past mistakes and in order that all sectors involved in the built environment can function together in a wider sustainable environment. Last October marked the 50th anniversary of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1963. It is timely that we are considering changes to the governing legislation. Debates continue on whether the system has served us well. While we must learn from the past and ensure similar mistakes are not repeated, we must also look to the future. The forthcoming planning Bills provide an opportunity to ensure we have a planning system that is fit for purpose and the best fit to guide development for the next 50 years.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">I thank Ms Hughes and her colleagues for coming before the joint committee. One of the main recommendations of the Mahon tribunal was the establishment of an independent planning regulator. Does the Irish Planning Institute have a view on whether this recommendation should be implemented?</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> Ms Hughes has stated a national planning framework is required to succeed the national spatial strategy. Based on what has emanated from the Department to date, is she hopeful work on developing such a framework is under way?</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Zoning in Dublin and larger towns is a widely discussed issue, as is the need to prioritise category 1 and 2 areas. On planning in rural areas, especially the issue of village consolidation, in some counties small amounts of land close to the centre of villages have been zoned. While I consider this to be the correct approach, some planners may frown on the practice on the basis that people should be pushed into larger towns. In approximately 20 villages and ten towns there are rural transport systems in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">It is easy for people to move about from those villages to the larger towns. It is also about trying to keep those villages sustainable, as there are people living in villages that are closed down and one cannot buy a litre of milk or a sliced pan. This means people are driving five or ten miles to buy daily necessities. Some counties zoned land close to the centre of villages to try to increase population and reduce the dependency on one-off houses beyond the edge of a village. Will the witnesses provide a view on that? A certain amount of this was done in County Laois, and some of it was okay for villages like Clonaslee, Ballyroan and Ballylinan. Some of those developments are well within the immediate vicinity of the village and have helped to make the village more sustainable in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> The size of apartments is an issue that arises repeatedly. There is a view that reducing apartment size or density standards is unlikely to stimulate housing growth, so what is the view of the delegation? I am not an expert but in the few other countries I have visited, apartments seem to be much larger. Balconies in this country tend to look like a small cattle crush fastened to the side of a building. They tend to be made from galvanised iron. If they were on the first storey, they could be used as cattle crushes. They look odd and they do not provide for sustainable family living. Even if one wanted to put out a deck chair or clothes horse on a sunny day, it might not be possible. What is the view of witnesses on apartment sizes?</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> What do the witnesses think about quality of apartments? Building regulations may not be the domain of the delegation but those regulations allow apartments to be separated by plaster slabs. I know little about construction but I know from experience that if a person is living in an apartment where neighbours are separated by two plaster slabs, there is not much privacy. I remember canvassing in the corridor of a block of apartments and I could hear a radio from four doors away. When the person with the radio opened the door as I called, the radio was not much louder than it had been in the corridor. I have discussed this with officials from the Department but I have been told it is legal. Nevertheless, I have serious concerns. I have seen diagrams of how smoke and flames can be deflected in the event of a fire but I am not convinced such a system is as good as a wall constructed with six-inch or four-inch blocks, let alone nine-inch blocks. This relates to soundproofing, privacy and fire safety. Does the Irish Planning Institute have a view on this? There were chicken boxes built in Portlaoise which sold for up to €250,000, and people were paid to queue overnight to buy some of these obnoxious apartments. People with more money than sense paid those people to stay overnight in order that the apartments could be bought. It is indicative of how we ended up.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> Does the IPI have the opinion that we should move towards better quality apartments? I do not have a problem <i>per se</i> with apartments where there is a demand for them, particularly near transport hubs, urban centres and close to employment. I can see the need to work in a sensible fashion in that regard. I saw balconies in Rome which appeared to be a small garden. They seemed to be five metres long and four or five metres wide. They seemed huge but they were not attached to penthouses. The proletariat lived in such apartments. Could we move to such a model? What is the IPI's views on separating dwellings with plaster slabs? In one apartment block, one neighbour had a row with another and put a foot through the wall. I saw the hole in the wall.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">Deputy Stanley raised a number of issues and I will try to go through them. The first concerned a regulator's office. The IPI wholeheartedly supports the establishment of a regulator and fundamentally believes such a regulator should be independent. If a decision is taken that the regulator would not be independent, there should be complete transparency in the direction and processes under which the regulator would function. It is very important that we have a transparent and credible planning system, and we see the establishment of the office of the planning regulator as a fundamental catalyst in enhancing public confidence in the planning system. The office of the regulator should have and fulfil a research function and role. The housing crisis emanating today indicates a lack of joined-up thinking and research when it comes to housing provision supply and demand, and the regulator's office would also fulfil that important function.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> My colleagues will address the issues relating to the national spatial scheme and rural housing, so I will skip to the issue of apartment sizes. The IPI believes we need quality developments and that we cannot compromise standards or afford to go back to the apartment sizes and the lack of quality in developments prevalent in the 1990s. This is exemplified by the shoebox apartments constructed, particularly under the urban renewal schemes in the 1990s. The Department has published minimum apartment sizes which are guidelines to which all local authorities have regard and which they implement. Recently, the media and lobbyists have called for a reduction in those standards. If there is one message we would like to get across today, it is that quality development is of the utmost importance. There is a need for a variety of house types and apartment sizes and it is very important that we ultimately have quality development that can be flexible not only to meet current needs but those which may arise in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> Mr. Henk van der Kamp will address the other issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I will respond to the question of what we expect of the next national spatial strategy. We would like to be optimistic but we must be realistic and consider what was contained in the last strategy. We are part of an institute of professional planners dealing with spatial planning. The next spatial strategy, if anything, should be spatial, which means it should be about choice and deciding where things go in the country. It should recognise that some areas have strengths for some types of activities, whereas other areas are particularly suitable for other activities. We welcome explicit and consistent identification of areas for particular purposes. In doing that, synergies can be achieved, as noted in our statement, to maximise the potential of different parts of the island for energy, landscape protection, housing and agriculture and other activities. Very often, land users can work together to provide these kinds of synergies, and this is what should be addressed by the national spatial strategy. In this context, a landscape strategy is essential, along with a coastal management policy for the coastline and foreshore area.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> I will address the Deputy's question about rural areas and villages. It is not for the national spatial strategy to dictate which village grows and which does not. That is a matter for a local county council and its county development plan. The planning system should continue to be based on the subsidiarity principle that what can be determined locally should be determined locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">What the Deputy referred to in terms of smaller villages taking their share in accommodating growth by zoning areas near the centre perhaps is something that would fit into a settlement strategy determined at a local level. We fully support that idea and that principle. We welcome development in villages. The settlement strategy needs to be consistent with the higher level strategies adopted in the regional planning guidelines and ultimately in the national spatial strategy. We sometimes refer to this as the Russian dolls - the planning hierarchy. Local planning needs to fit in with regional planning strategies and the national planning strategies. There is a link between the national spatial strategy and ultimately which village gets disowned. It is just a link of logic, not a link of determination at national level.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">Ultimately it comes back to quality development. The Irish Planning Institute takes a holistic approach in terms of development and quality development. We are not involved in building control. That legislation is separate from planning but overall quality of development would address those issues raised by the Deputy in terms of building materials and suitable standards.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">I thank the witness for appearing before the committee. I related to much of what Deputy Stanley said and agree wholeheartedly with his remarks about apartments. I think there is a definite place for apartments but the whole idea has not been sold well due to the lack of quality in some of what has been provided. That has partly to do with the construction but also with the whole management system. I come from an area where we have experience of strategic development zones, SDZs, and would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses in terms of their continued usefulness, as I would be broadly in favour of them from what I have seen. That ties in with my second point. It strikes me that to date so much of our planning has been reactive and that there has not really been a plan for a town. I remember walking around the town of Ennis, which I did not know particularly well, about three years ago and being struck by the beauty of its centre. I then moved out to the areas developed since the 1960s, the quality of which was so inferior to the town centre. There is a rather haphazard surround to a beautiful town centre which, sadly, is true of so many places in this country. This means we need a longer term forward-planning approach. Perhaps the witnesses would comment on that in respect of new legislation or changes that ought to be made. I would also be interested in a comment on how we can best deal with the problems of infill in towns and cities from Dublin to smaller towns around the country and how the areas that are becoming derelict can be turned around. I am sure the witnesses would agree that it would be far better that those areas be occupied rather than driving people further out.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">The Irish Planning Institute would have a view that SDZs provide an improved framework over other planning mechanisms for a more holistic approach to development of large scale new areas. Obvious examples of that are in south Dublin, such as Adamstown which has worked to a point and is now being revised to try to get it going again within the current context. That is highlighted in terms of new legislation. Some improvements are needed to address the lack of flexibility in SDZs. There is a need for a much better co-ordinated and joined-up approach. They need to be able to change as circumstances change. One legislative amendment that is required is to have a fast-track mechanism for bringing forward amendments to planning schemes. At the moment there is no mechanism for an amendment; one has to go through the same process as in drawing up a planning scheme for a strategic development zone. That is an issue the Department is looking at under Construction 2020 and we welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Another key issue that needs to be addressed is the role of An Bord Pleanála because there is no third party role in appeal rights, or even first party appeal rights, within planning applications within a strategic development zone. The appeal process on the planning scheme is very important. At the moment the board has a very limited role because it is restricted by the 2010 Act to making only minor changes to planning schemes. Therefore, there is a danger that we end up with schemes that are, perhaps, sub-optimum in the board’s view because it is unable to take on board the submissions made by interested parties during the process and translate those into decisions involving amendments, other than minor amendments to the scheme. The board’s role is very much confined to minor issues and it needs to be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">Not at the beginning. I was a councillor in South Dublin County Council where we had a dispute with the council about the development of Clonburris SDZ, which still has not happened. It ended up going before a hearing that involved An Bord Pleanála and it was able to overturn quite a number of decisions the council made. I think that what some of the councillors want is going to be achieved because of the changed circumstances in the country. As an elected representative, I was very annoyed that it could overturn decisions we made.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">It could do that at that time but not now. As there is no appeal process later on, it is important that the issues can be addressed fully in the plan making scheme and the board has the ability to change the scheme if it is considered necessary, having heard all the evidence from the different parties. If it is of that view, it should be able to make that change and, obviously, it would have to have regard to the view of the council in deciding what is the appropriate change. In terms of implementation, these are complex and large scale areas. Ms Hughes mentioned the need for an annual review process within SDZs to review how the scheme is working and to see what changes are needed as it is being implemented, particularly in rapidly changing economic circumstances. Linked to that is the planning scheme and the funding process for development levies. There should be a much closer tie-in between the section 48 development levies and the planning scheme. Those levies raised within a planning scheme area should be spent within that area to provide the facilities in communities for the new development area itself and should be ring-fenced.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">One of the problems with derelict sites is that much of the time they are complicated by their title. Derelict sites is an area of the legislation which probably has not been advanced or used very well by local authorities. The derelict sites levy is in place. I do not know the exact returns in terms of the levy but my experience of the system would suggest that the levy is not utilised or effectively utilised. Also the local authority has powers in respect of CPOs.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Perhaps a way of advancing the issue of derelict sites, particularly those sites which are scarred by bad title, would be for the local authorities to place CPOs on those sites and sell them on with a clean title. Vacant and derelict sites need to be actively promoted, particularly by local authorities, so that we have an active management process in terms of promoting their development. This active management process could include reduced development contributions, as advocated under the development contribution scheme, and other incentives to try to stimulate redevelopment.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> I will now pass over to my colleague, Mr. van der Kamp, to deal with the issue of effective plan-led development and the changes required in legislation for this.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">We need forward planning and to set out where and how an area should grow spatially in terms of roads and housing. This is done in a county development plan, but more likely through a local area plan, which is already included in current legislation. We suggest strongly that we should provide for more of this in the new planning Bill. In other words, we should have more local area plans and more forward planning for an area before development takes place and even before the pressures arise. We should think about how the area should develop and set that out in writing in a clear plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> We should also minimise the procedural obstacles afterwards for the implementation of the plan. This is where the development sector comes in. A plan of itself is not the implementation. The implementation happens through developers submitting proposals, coming together and making development contributions which will facilitate the infrastructure. Our institute has observed that some obstacles to development could be removed, for example, in terms of length of planning application procedures, development contribution impediments, phasing and clarity of conditions attached to planning permissions. In other words, we must try to minimise the obstacles. Once a decision has been made in accordance with the plan, the development should go ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> We would like to emphasise that there are advantages and benefits for society in adopting a plan-led rather than a development-led approach. A development-led approach is one where the planning system responds to project proposals from developers in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner. This does not necessarily mean it makes bad decisions, but it deals with each application on its own. A plan-led approach lays down a framework for development so that the development sector has certainty and predictability. This does not only apply to housing development, but also to wind energy products, industrial and commercial development, etc. Our planning system provides for much of this already, but there is room for significant improvement in regard to the implementation phase and planning permission.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_21">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_64">The Irish Planning Institute presentation commenced by saying there has been some confusion in regard to planning and that although people tend to talk about the area as a combined entity, there are separate roles and many different players. I understand that as I have spent many days trying to explain to people how things are done. It is obvious significant work needs to be done on various levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> I believe we need forward planning. The national spatial strategy is a critical part of the hierarchy. When the regional planning guidelines knitted into the national spatial strategy, this produced a change in culture within the local authorities. I noticed a major change in culture within Kildare County Council when people fitted into that more strategic approach. However, does the institute accept that we cannot have a purely spatial strategy and that there must be some sort of dovetailing with the national development plan? Large initiatives, such as transportation planning, must dovetail if we are to have rational planning. Should these planning strategies happen in conjunction with each other?</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> The sequence of events is important. I find it frustrating that some of the other legislation required, such as the building control Bill, the planning (No. 2) Bill and Bills such as the one I produced seeking greater transparency, have not been passed. People would be astounded if they looked back at what happened in 2008 and realised that we have not spent the intervening years getting what went wrong right before the construction industry kicked off again. I do not believe we are anywhere near getting it right. We are now back at the point of looking at introducing incentives for developers. I find this incredibly frustrating. We tend to make our decisions at a crisis point which is part of the reason for criticism of decisions, such as on the size of apartments now that we have a housing shortage. The industry will obviously argue its own corner and explain how it can do more for less and how more money can be made from development. However, we are constantly making decisions at a time of crisis, rather than planning ahead to prevent a crisis. </p>
          <p eId="para_67"> I want to address a number of specific issues. In the new (No. 1) Bill, it is proposed there will be a register of planning permissions and if they are not taken up within three years, they will expire. This is to reduce the length of time and before development commences and to ensure people do not sit on land. This is fine, provided all the elements required to develop the land stack up, including water and wastewater treatment systems and so on. The issue is not as simple as dealing with people sitting on planning permissions granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> We also need to have a compliance register in regard to enforcement notices. This must happen at national level because of the movement of people who are non-compliant from one area to another. I am aware of the time, effort and energy that goes into compliance in planning departments, such as taking issues relating to warning or enforcement notices as far as the courts. It is unbelievable that we do not use this information at national level. I am curious to hear the institute's views on that. I believe we should reward good behaviour. Good developers who do not engage in bad practice are not rewarded, because there is no overall overview of the situation and non-compliant bad developers can move from one area to another. Therefore, sequence is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> The institute mentioned Part V and the conditions in this are to be changed in the (No. 1) Bill. I have some concerns about this. How would the institute like to see the provisions for this stated in legislation? Will the witnesses flesh out its views on timelines and so on? I believe a real mess has been made of the issue of development contributions. For example, a circular issued in December 2013 more or less told local authorities they could not apply water or wastewater development contributions, because these were now the function of Irish Water. Now, Irish Water does not have that function and this critical income source is compromised, at least for 12 months. What role does the institute see for development contributions? These contributions vary throughout the country. Do the contributions need to be rationalised? The cost of building a water or wastewater facility or a road will not vary significantly from one part of the country to another.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">I am curious about that. We are now at a point where we are discussing reducing development contributions to stimulate development. What do the witnesses think their functions should be? The 2006 Act on strategic development dealt with major infrastructural projects. An Bord Pleanála deals with that. I have no problem with that if it is the Luas. However, there are matters such as wind farms, for example, where technology and information have moved on since 2006. We are facing a situation where guidelines will be produced but the applications will be made before that, so people are shooting in the dark when making the application. Do the witnesses think matters such as that should be positioned more at local government level, where there is an appeals mechanism? Does that Act go too far and does it weaken the position for the public in terms of not having an appeals mechanism on something like that and where the technology is changing? That has become a real bone of contention.</p>

          <p eId="para_71">Deputy Murphy raised a number of issues. With regard to her observations about confusion within the system and, indeed, relating to the correlation between strategic infrastructure plans, such as the national development plan, county development plans and regional plans, the Irish Planning Institute has long been calling for publication of the Government’s planning policy statement setting out the aims and objectives of the planning system and how that can affect different provisions within different Departments. We understand from the Department that the planning policy statement is in train. We consider it quite urgent at this stage because we fundamentally believe that the work of Irish Water or of the Office of Public Works regarding flood mapping and the provision of infrastructure flood protection measures should be influenced by planning and should be aligned to the objectives of, for example, settlement strategy. Without that planning policy statement the public is not aware of the importance of planning, the objectives of the planning system and where planning and other provisions should be aligned. That is one important aspect. We agree that items such as the national development plan, the national spatial strategy and other development plans must all be in line and synchronised together.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> Regarding the register of planning permissions the Deputy mentioned and the indication that they might just be retained for a period of three years, it takes a long time for a potential project to evolve. It takes a long time for it to advance through the planning system and then a long time to be implemented in terms of compliance with planning conditions and addressing certain key infrastructure. The Deputy made those points. One issue that must be seriously examined within the planning Bill, and we referred to it in our opening statement, is compliance with conditions attached to a planning permission and the length of time it is taking for planning authorities to issue compliance with those conditions. It can take anything from one month to eight months to secure compliance with planning conditions, and it is issues such as these which are an obstacle in the system to implementing development on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> The Irish Planning Institute wholeheartedly supports the provisions of Part V, particularly the emphasis on the provision of social housing. There are indications that the Part V provision focusing on social housing might be reduced from 20% to 10%. Looking at the current system and at how we could potentially improve it, there are difficulties in the system in terms of reaching agreement on the level of Part V that is to be provided. There is no doubt that securing legal agreement on any development issue can take a huge amount of time. However, at present, it is quite an impediment, and it has been in the past, to delivering infrastructure projects on the ground. There must be some mechanism for negotiating Part V agreements. They must be embedded in some form of statutory timeline process to ensure that the matters can be dealt with in a timely and effective manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> There are pros and cons as to whether the Part V proposal should be dealt with pre-planning or post-planning. There are merits in it being dealt with pre-planning from the point of view that one plans for the social housing provision as part of one’s planning application and one gets the house type and size right. However, progressing and negotiating a Part V agreement pre-planning will involve time delays. It is another bureaucratic system or process that one will have to deal with before lodging for planning. That is a time constraint in itself. If one does it post-planning permission or when the planning permission is issued, one can address the Part V issue when one is dealing with compliance with other conditions associated with one’s planning permission. There can be a time saving there. The difficulty, of course, is that it could be a case that a planning permission has been issued that is perhaps not suitable for the purposes of social housing or for the social need of that particular area.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> Another issue relating to Part V that probably requires consideration is to provide more definite notice of the requirements in advance of any potential developer coming to the table. Indeed, DKM undertook a report on the Part V process and it consulted the public in that regard. One of its recommendations was that perhaps we could identify and have more clearly defined areas within development plans where a specific social housing need was required or particular housing types were required.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> The objective of Part V should be to create greater clarity in the system in terms of what is provided and therefore to encourage and facilitate the process as much as possible, as opposed to becoming a burdensome issue. We have concerns about other issues and how they will be addressed, for example, if the 10% social housing is a mandatory provision, how that will be applied to smaller schemes and how it will work out. There must be some element of flexibility within the system for it to be implementable on the ground, but there is certainly no easy solution to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> I will ask my colleagues to reply on development contributions.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">We agree that further work must be done to improve the operation of the development contribution system. It is fundamentally a sound principle, but it has been in place for approximately ten years and we must review how it works in practice. There has been a review of the level at which development levies are set throughout the country and there are now lower levels, but many planning permissions were granted when the levels were higher and at levels which make development unviable. One of the provisions in the new planning Bill is that the new levels would apply retrospectively and we certainly support that. It must happen. It would enable planning permissions to be activated and help to deliver housing supply in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> There must also be greater consistency throughout the country as there is considerable inconsistency, as the Deputy said. There must also be a more sophisticated approach to levies in terms of looking at different types of development more carefully. Many local authorities have a single levy for commercial development, for example. The ability to sustain such a levy is very different for a town centre retail scheme as opposed to a large floor plate industrial scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">Levies need to be more sophisticated and consider the types and locations of development. Levies should be applied and ring-fenced to provide the infrastructure and community and transport facilities they are designed to provide, not go into a general pool of expenditure. There should be very clear tracking between the levies collected and their expenditure on providing the infrastructure and community facilities they are designed to provide.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, there are many advantages and one can accept the way it works. However, the institute expressed concern when the Bill was introduced to transfer decision making from a local authority to An Bord Pleanála. One of the concerns we had at the time was that the board was changing its role. In the context of developing wind farm technology, it is a valid point and ties in with the plan-led argument. If county development plans are clear and there is a clear acknowledgement of infrastructure requirement, there is no reason infrastructure cannot be dealt with at local authority level.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">Some of my questions have been asked. The witnesses are very welcome. When we were discussing who would come in to discuss the new planning Bill, I made sure the IPI's name was included as a priority. Given that there have been 50 years of modern Irish planning since the last Planning Act, it is time for a new Bill. The witnesses referred to the term “planner” and the need to ensure everybody is qualified. University qualification is the academic requirement. Is continuous professional development the only side the witnesses want to put into legislation? The witnesses mentioned the optimal use of different parts of the country to maximise the island's potential, and much of that already happens under planning regulations in various development plans. I know the landscape strategy, and witnesses' suggestion that energy infrastructure for renewable energy would be mandatory in any future development plans is a good recommendation.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> The witnesses elaborated on Part 5, and it is the most important part, particularly with the homeless numbers and the housing situation. Could the witnesses identify one thing we should be doing now to speed up the process that would put houses on the ground, particularly social housing and housing for the homeless? The statutory provision requiring planning authorities to resolve compliance submissions within a specific timeframe should be put in place. Each planning authority should have a time limit in which to enforce compliance. Personnel in the local authorities should be designated to do the enforcement. Local authorities fall down on enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> The witnesses recommended that certificates of lawfulness of use of development be introduced. What would they cover? The planning review of various local authorities that reported in 2012 made 12 specific recommendations. Mr. van der Kamp did an independent review of the review and rejected some of the recommendations. It is important to hear them. One recommendation with which he disagreed was the requirement that developers be banned from making local area plans. Everybody should be involved in some way in making local area plans, because everybody brings different knowledge, including the community, developer and planner. Could Mr. van der Kamp comment on the proposal that developers be banned from making local area plans? It is not in his document today but in his review of the 2012 planning review.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">I welcome the IPI members and thank them for their presentation. Could they critique the national spatial strategy in light of the aspirations and ideas behind gateways and hubs? How effective has it been? What has it meant for the towns and cities that have been so designated? North of a line from Louth to Galway, there are no motorways, there is poorer connectivity and there has been less investment in towns over the lifetime of our national spatial strategy. To what extent have we achieved balanced regional development since the Celtic tiger when money was spent on infrastructure? What might the witnesses change about the designation of towns as gateways and hubs? What could we do to accelerate the sort of development we would like to see in these areas? What can be done to redress the imbalance? I am from County Mayo.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> It is an aspiration that all planning would dovetail. We constantly refer to our Food Harvest 2020 targets, which aim to ramp up agricultural production. Much of it is based on our pasture land for feeding our animals, which is unique to us. On the other hand, we have energy targets for electricity and energy crops. Although I have not seen it seriously happen, in my home county people are being encouraged to grow willow for the generation of electricity. On the other hand, we want more cattle and are abolishing the dairy quota next year. To what extent have these competing interests been examined? What are the guiding principles? Is it purely over to the Government of the day, or can there be a more rounded approach? Have any of the Departments examined how to deal with competing interests, what it might mean and who might have to cut back on their objectives? Maybe that will not have to happen. In my constituency, these interests seem to compete and it seems to be a matter of choice for each farmer.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">IPI members must have academic qualifications in planning from one of the accredited planning schools, and to become a full member, MIPI, they are assessed on their competence and experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">They require an academic qualification in planning from one of the accredited planning schools and, to become a full member of the IPI, an assessment of their competence and experience. Currently, a person can describe himself or herself as a planner and provide planning services but not be a member of any institute and not necessarily have any education in planning. This means there is no consistency in terms of standard of knowledge or ethics. All our members are subject to a code of ethics and continuous professional development, which we believe are important for high quality professionals. It is important planners have a good grounding in the discipline and that they keep up to date in what is an ever-changing part of public policy on a national and European level. </p>
          <p eId="para_89"> Non-members who operate as planners cannot be disciplined for unethical behaviour. We believe that a lack of standards across the board has hampered proper planning and planning outcomes. None of what we are proposing would stop these people from providing planning services but it would clarify for the public that they are dealing with people who are not professional planners, in particular in the context of CPD. </p>
          <p eId="para_90"> In regard to what might change, it is important to reiterate that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the profession and local authorities have developed a suite of guidelines for sustainable communities, urban and road design and so on. There is a strong body of best practice guidelines for local authorities and An Bord Pleanála to draw on. A great deal of time has been spent on ensuring that permissions will lead to better outcomes and longer-term sustainable development. I will hand over to my colleague to respond on the other issues of compliance and NSS.</p>

          <from> Mr. John Spain<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_91">In regard to compliance and other measures to speed up the process in terms of delivering on housing and getting houses built, there are more than enough lands zoned in the greater Dublin area than is required to meet housing needs for the next four years. There are also sufficient planning permissions but these are not being implemented. There are a number of measures set out in Construction 2020 which should be incorporated into the planning Bill as well as into policy. We would generally support those measures which will help speed up the delivery of housing. There are many issues arising outside planning. Issues such as financing, funding, resourcing and the ability of developers to build houses also need to be addressed. These are also dealt with in other parts of Construction 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> On compliance, we have highlighted this as an area that needs to be properly codified and speeded up in terms of the timescale within which decisions are made. We would agree with the view that there has been a long-standing gap in planning practice in that enforcement has always fallen far short of what it should be. There have been some improvements in this area in the past five to ten years but enforcement still falls short of what it should be. This is primarily down to the resourcing of planning departments to ensure priority is given to enforcement matters. If planning is not enforced, it loses its effectiveness. </p>
          <p eId="para_93"> In terms of certificates of lawfulness, this concept arises from a need to tidy up gaps and failures in existing legislation to provide people with a mechanism whereby they can obtain certainty as to whether something they propose to do in terms of development is compliant with planning or even requires planning permission. It is important there is a clear decision in that regard, on which people can rely. Currently, this is addressed by way of section 5 certificates. However, some difficulties have arisen in that while a land owner could obtain from a local authority a section 5 certificate in respect of a proposed development another party can make an application in respect of the same development to the local authority and then appeal that to the board, the result being a contrary decision. This means there can be two contrary decisions on one matter, which leads to uncertainty for people. The legislation was never intended to be used in this way and so it needs to be tidied up. The way to address this is, we suggest, through certificates of lawfulness in respect of a proposed use or development. This would also address the issue of a use which has been in existence for more than seven years and is beyond enforcement. It is not possible to enforce against a development after seven years unless it is in breach of a condition on use. This means that because such developments are not lawful but cannot be enforced against the situation remains in limbo. A certificate of lawfulness would enable that to be tidied up and would again provide certainty to people in making a decision in respect of a property investment. </p>
          <p eId="para_94"> On local area plans, these should of course be prepared by the planning authority rather than developers. There are cases where developers have prepared plans. This arises because of resource failings within the local authority. It is important local authorities have the resources to prepare plans. Obviously, the local authorities are the statutory bodies responsible for such plans.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">Ms Hughes has asked me to respond to the Senator Keane's question, although I do so not wearing my IPI hat. The reason for that conclusion in the report was based on the distinction between the preferred preparation of a draft plan and the making of a plan. The making of the plan is the function of the local authority. The preparation of the plan should be undertaken by the local authority personnel but when this is not possible it may be pragmatic to have consultancy provided. Effectively, the conclusion was that there is no basic reason that cannot be provided by a developer on behalf of the authority. However, as I said, the making of the development plan is the function of the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> On the question regarding balanced regional development and the national spatial strategy, as an institute we believe this is a matter of choice. Planning is about making choices and that is often difficult. However, it is the reality. To make the gateway cities work in any spatial strategy there must be consistency and a concentration of resources in those areas and on development. Looking back over the national spatial strategy, that was not always done in a consistent manner, which would have weakened the strategy somewhat. Any future spatial strategy should anticipate those difficulties and build into it a framework to ensure that is addressed. As stated earlier in our submission, we believe a national spatial strategy should not be solely about gateway cities and towns rather it should also be about the use of different parts of the country for different types of use. This ties in with the comment in relation to the food versus biomass issue. Again, this about choice. We have so many acres of land and must make choices about how we use it. This is a very good example of the link between sectoral planning and spatial planning. The Green Paper on Energy addresses the issue of whether biomass should be used for energy purposes. That will have spatial consequences. It is a sectoral decision with spatial consequences. I believe a national spatial strategy will also have to take a view on this because it affects counties like Mayo and other parts of Ireland. It is ultimately a balancing of the interests of agriculture, food production, the benefits that biomass can bring to our energy palette. It is important these issues are addressed in a national spatial strategy, which is tied in with the sectoral strategy one energy. That is an example of how the sectoral and spatial should interact.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">We are resuming the meeting in public session. We will now consider a number of topics with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and with the Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs, Deputy Joe McHugh. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> I want to welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and their departmental officials to this meeting. The officials are Mr. Joe Hamill, Secretary General; Mr. Niall Ó Donnchú, assistant secretary; Ms Máire Killoran, director of Irish; Ms Mary Hurley, principal officer; and Ms Sinead Copeland, assistant principal officer. I thank them all for their attendance here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> I wish to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given. They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. </p>
          <p eId="para_101"> I also wish to advise witnesses that the opening statement and any other documentation they provide to us this afternoon may be published on the committee's website once the meeting has concluded.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">Thank you, Chairman. As the new Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the committee today. I see this as a valuable opportunity to set out my priorities in coming year. In the time allotted I will deal with as many issues as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> I will firstly address the committee’s report on utilising the arts to combat disadvantage among the young, the old and socially disadvantaged, and to encourage their greater integration and social inclusion within local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> First and foremost, I thank committee members for undertaking this report. It is clear that a lot of work went into it and I am particularly impressed by the number of stakeholders from across the arts that gave evidence to the committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_108"> The 19 recommendations are wide ranging and challenging. The key recommendations in this report focus on addressing disadvantage and essentially propose that new functions be given to me as Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and to my Department. </p>
          <p eId="para_109"> Recommendation No. 1 proposes that the arts be used as a fundamental means of combating social exclusion and disadvantage. There are a number of recommendations linked to this which propose research and study into the subject of how the arts could be used to combat disadvantage in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> Over a third of the recommendations deal with the relationship of local authorities with various bodies, including the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Arts Council, and other local funding agencies.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">Two weeks ago, I met with local authority arts officers to discuss their concerns and their ideas for the future. Following on from that, I am looking for ways which would improve communication and linkages between the arts officers and other stakeholder bodies. I understand that the Arts Council is examining new, more informative and transparent ways of presenting information on the combined local authority and Arts Council funding of the arts. At present, the council’s website gives details of all funding distributed to local authorities and to arts organisations in each local authority area.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> Recommendation No. 4 proposes that my Department becomes the primary source of all funding to the arts, both through local authorities and directly to arts organisations. At present, the Arts Council is the main channel of State support for the arts. I believe that the Arts Council has served the arts and this country well for over 60 years. I do not envisage any fundamental change in the institutional arrangements which encompass the arm's length approach of Arts Council distribution of Exchequer funding to the arts. Expertise on the arts resides in the Arts Council and it is therefore best placed to identify and fund excellence in the arts. My Department is currently considering this report in more detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I was delighted recently to launch in the GPO Ireland 2016 with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin. This is a national initiative led by my Department which will develop, co-ordinate and deliver a programme of activity to mark the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising. This programme will be underpinned by the €4 million I secured in the recent budget which will be used to roll out an integrated plan during 2015. Community involvement is key to having a lasting and meaningful commemoration and the framework launched recently will facilitate that engagement. In the coming three months a dedicated team in my Department will actively engage with communities, schools, relative groups, colleges, businesses, voluntary organisations, arts and cultural institutions, historical societies and local government. In conjunction with local authorities, a series of meetings will be held to facilitate "ground up" initiatives in order that local communities can get involved and put their own shape on the commemorations as we move towards 2016. A vibrant culture programme with an international dimension will be finalised in co-operation with the national cultural institutions, the Arts Council of Ireland and Culture Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_114"> The relatives of those who fought and died during the 1916 Rising will play a central role in a number of key State events. I am engaging actively with this grouping. I will also be working with the Minister for Education and Skills to develop arts programmes in schools. We will build on the links developed during The Gathering to reach out to local communities and the Diaspora. In addition to this, the committee will be aware that earlier this year the Government allocated €22 million - for 2015 - for seven flagship commemorative projects to be finalised in time for Easter 2016. They include the building of an interpretive centre at the GPO, refurbishment works at the original barracks, the upgrade of Kilmainham Courthouse and Gaol, the restoration of the historical Kevin Barry Room in the National Concert Hall, the development of a new visitor centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh, Ros Muc, the restoration of 14 Henrietta Street as a tenement museum and the development of Cathal Brugha Barracks to support a new military service pension archives facility. Each of these projects will deepen our understanding of the history of the period and provide an enduring and permanent tribute to those involved in the Rising. </p>
          <p eId="para_115"> In addition, we published an outline programme of official State events to be held at Easter 2016. These events will honour those who took part in the Rising in an appropriate and respectful manner. I will be happy to go into this in more detail if need be. I look forward to working with the expert advisory group and my colleagues in the Oireachtas all-party consultation group. I would welcome any view the committee would like to share today. </p>
          <p eId="para_116"> That brings me to the issue of the Moore Street national monument. I share the committee’s desire to see a fitting testament to the leaders of the 1916 Rising being put in place on the site. I will continue to support and encourage efforts to secure progress insofar as it is open to me to do so and it is within my remit under the National Monuments Acts. As the committee knows from its own interactions in the case, 14 to 17 Moore Street are the subject of a preservation order under the National Monuments Acts. The preservation order was put in place in 2007 to protect 16 Moore Street as the site of the final Council of War and the final headquarters of the leaders of the Rising. To enhance and protect the setting and amenity of 16 Moore Street, the preservation order covers 14, 15 and 17 Moore Street. As a consequence of the 2007 preservation order, works affecting the monument buildings require the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. After extensive deliberations, final consent under the National Monuments Acts was given by my predecessor in April for the creation of a 1916 commemorative centre in the monument buildings, involving the full repair and conservation of the structures, both internally and externally. I am satisfied that the decision made in April provides the means to secure the future of one of the most important sites in modern Irish history. I have visited the national monument and been through the entire site and surrounding area. During my visit I spoke to a number of the Moore Street traders who were very supportive of the plans for the monument and the proposals to redevelop the greater area. </p>
          <p eId="para_117"> The committee will be aware of the land swap deal that recently was placed before Dublin City Council. I am disappointed that the members of the council chose not to support this plan which would have released NAMA funding for the development of an appropriate tribute on Moore Street to the leaders and events of the 1916 Rising. The proposal put before the council provided a real opportunity to have the restoration work completed and the commemorative centre open in time for the centenary of the Rising in 2016. Following the vote to reject the proposal, it is now a matter for the council and the monument owners to consider the implications for the national monument buildings, the NAMA funding for the proposed restoration project and the centenary commemorations in 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> The granting of consent under the National Monument Acts completes my Department’s function in this case. I will, however, continue to support all appropriate initiatives to secure the restoration of the national monument, consistent with my statutory function under the National Monuments Acts and the roles and responsibilities of the other interested parties involved. In that context, I will shortly be meeting the members of Dublin City Council’s Moore Street advisory committee again to go through the process with them and encourage them to try to advance a solution that will see the restoration project moving forward. </p>
          <p eId="para_119"> As I mentioned, the 1916 centenary commemorations are a key priority for the Department in the coming year. I will also be working on the continued development and delivery of a rolling programme of commemorations along the decade of centenaries timeline. It is also my intention to publish the National Concert Hall Bill and I look forward to receiving the committee’s report on it in order that this matter can be progressed as a priority. Other key priorities for me will be the development of a national cultural policy, Culture 2025, which will set out the high level aims and policies in the area of culture for the period up until 2025. My Department is drafting a discussion paper which will be published early in the new year to facilitate a public consultation on this offer. This is the first time in the history of the State that any Government has undertaken such an endeavour. </p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I take the opportunity to mention the Arts in Education charter, something I am very eager to progress. Making the arts more accessible will be a cornerstone of my ministry. Immersing school students in the arts through a targeted strategy will benefit future generations and give young people a greater understanding and appreciation of the arts as they progress to adulthood. A high level implementation group chaired by Professor John Coolahan, professor emeritus at NUI, Maynooth, was set up to oversee implementation of the charter. This group meets very regularly and progress is being made on a number of initiatives, including increasing the number of artists in residence in colleges of education and developing a portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors. Suitable models for artists to become involved in the programme are also being examined by the group. </p>
          <p eId="para_121"> Since the Government took office, a huge effort has also been made to resolve the issue of the protection of Ireland's raised bog special areas of conversation, SAC, within the framework of the habitats directive. This has included intense engagement with turf cutting interests, farmers, non-governmental organisations and the European Commission. A long-term compensation scheme was introduced to compensate cutters for their loss. The Government published Ireland's first ever draft national peat lands strategy last January and I hope to be in a position to finalise the strategy early in the new year. It sets out the Government's view on how we can collectively manage our peatlands for many interests, including continued cutting, conservation, recreation and other uses. It also sets the wide use of peatlands in the context of Ireland's carbon reduction obligations. My Department will also continue to move forward next year with the national raised bog SAC management plan, the implementation of the compensation scheme which has been extended to raised bog natural heritage area sites and progressing the relocation of turf cutters to non-designated bogs. On the issue of wider habitats protection, I have recently obtained approval for Ireland's first ever prioritised action plan to focus attention on those protected habitats which need to be improved. Addressing our peatlands restoration objectives is very much part of this new plan, as are new agri-environment measures being rolled out by the Department Agriculture, Food and the Marine as part of the green low carbon agri-environment, GLAS, scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">My Department has worked closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on these issues to ensure farmers are incentivised to manage our most important habitats in a sustainable manner. </p>
          <p eId="para_123"> My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, also has a number of priorities regarding the Irish language and Gaeltacht areas. The cornerstone of Government policy on the Irish language is its 20 year strategy for the period 2010 to 2030. My Department has an overarching co-ordinating role in implementing the strategy in conjunction with a range of key stakeholders. Progress is being made in a systematic manner across many measures under the strategy, allowing for the resources available. My Department is implementing the language planning process under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 in conjunction with Údarás na Gaeltachta and Foras na Gaeilge. Priority is being given to the Gaeltacht language planning areas identified for the purposes of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> The committee may be aware that the official languages (amendment) Bill 2014 is on the A list of the Government's legislative programme and is being drafted. Subject to Government approval, it is hoped the Bill will be published by the end of the year. Following an extensive public consultation process, the Bill provides for amendments to the Official Languages Act 2003 in accordance with the commitment in the programme for Government. As the committee will be aware, my Department is the joint sponsor, with the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland, on two North-South Implementation Bodies, Waterways Ireland and the Language Body. The Departments work together to support the work of the bodies in each jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> In addition to progressing North-South co-operation, my key priority is progressing the first stage of the Ulster Canal project from upper Lough Erne to Castle Saunderson, near Belturbet, County Cavan. I am working on this with the Government and other key partners, including the North-South Ministerial Council and Waterways Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> My Department continues to fund the provision of essential transport services to the offshore islands as part of its role in assisting the sustainable development of island communities. I understand the Chairman has a particular interest in the passenger service between Long Island, County Cork, and the mainland. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, will be happy to address that matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_127"> Regarding offshore islands outside the Gaeltacht, I understand the local and community development programme officially ended at the end of 2013 but is being implemented on a transitional basis until the end of March 2015, pending the roll-out of the new programme, the social inclusion and community activation programme in April 2015. Officials from my Department have met senior officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to discuss the situation regarding community development offices on non-Gaeltacht islands. It has been agreed that we will work together to ensure the services they provide are retained and that both Departments will examine ways of supporting the continuation of these vital island structures and services. I am confident that an appropriate solution will be found in co-operation with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> I thank committee members for giving me the opportunity to address them today. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, and I will be happy to answer their questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">Cuirim fáilte roimh chuile duine atá i láthair anseo inniu. Bhí an cur i láthair thar a bheith úsáideach. Tá fios agam go bhfuilimid gann ar am ag an bpointe seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> The Minister's presentation was very helpful and there are five or six issues I would like to raise. I commend the Minister for stressing the importance of utilising the arts to combat social disadvantage. Great work was done by members of the committee in producing the report mentioned. The engagement of the Minister with arts officers around the country indicates the fact that much can be achieved through local authorities. It is vitally important that members of the public are aware of the benefits accruing from engagement with the arts in all of its manifestations. The arts can enrich communities and lives. They can contribute to the renewal and revival of communities and be of economic benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> The Minister referred to the centenary commemorations. Nobody doubts the difficulties facing Ministers in striking the right balance in the forthcoming decade of commemorations. The period 1912 to 1922 was probably the most difficult and fraught in Irish history and it is important that the commemorations are tolerant, inclusive and respectful. To say the least, the public's response to the 1916 Rising commemoration proposals has been underwhelming. Looking in from the outside, I have the sense that the Oireachtas advisory committee and the expert panel were not involved to the extent that they might have been. I understand that on the day the announcement was made a presentation was made to them and I would have expected a more hands-on role for both groups in advising the Government. It is fair to say the 1916 Rising commemoration video produced has caused deep disappointment around the country. There has been much reference to it in the national media and it indicates a complete lack of understanding of the events of 1916 and the manner in which they should be commemorated. It was suggested to me that Google Translate had been used to reproduce the 1916 Proclamation of Independence and I do not believe the signatories to the Proclamation were even mentioned in the video. It would be fine to use the video to promote Ireland to tourists, but I put it to the Minister that many believe it is not an appropriate commemoration, given the sensitivity and importance of the events of 1916. Much more could be said about this, but we may not have time to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> I concur with the Minister's remarks about the Moore Street monument and share her disappointment that Dublin City Council recently voted in the way it did. She has suggested the pragmatic approach of developing houses from 14 to 17 Moore Street. Like her, I have visited the site and seen how the buildings are falling into greater decay on a daily basis. Urgent intervention is required as the project, if it had proceeded in the way originally envisaged, could have been delivered on time for the centenary commemorations. I do not know what will happen now, but it could be a travesty. I do not question the motivations of those on Dublin City Council who voted in the way they did, nor do I distrust those who want attention to be paid to the broader battlefield. Will the funding necessary to achieve these objectives be obtained in a reasonable timeframe or are we risking further degradation of the site as a result?</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> I commend the Minister on her work in the areas of the arts and education and what is stated in the report. The Arts Charter is very positive. It is very important that a person of the calibre of Professor John Coolahan is involved. This signifies the importance of the arts in second level education. Huge work has been done in promoting the arts in every primary school in the country, but things get a little ropey at second level owing to timing and so on. More work needs to be done in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The Minister referred to the Arts Council, which is of enormous importance. Its budget for this year is €56.9 million. A new chair and members of the Arts Council were recently appointed. Those appointments followed an announcement by the then Minister, Deputy Deenihan, in March 2013 when he addressed the Royal Irish Academy that he would look at the boards of the cultural institutions. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has probably heard more than she wants to hear about the cultural institutions; she will forgive me for raising such a matter again. The then Minister said he would reduce the membership of these boards and streamline them, with members serving on a <i>pro bono</i> basis. An advertisement was subsequently placed for those boards, including the Arts Council. Have things changed? Are the members of the Arts Council being remunerated? If they are being remunerated, who has approved their remuneration? Is their remuneration in addition to expenses they are being paid, if they are being paid expenses? If this has happened, was there any public announcement of the change of position by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, or is it something that has happened quietly behind the scenes?</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> The national media made reference recently to an allegation that a member of staff of the Arts Council had been involved in the payment of a grant to a family member. I understand this is under investigation within the Arts Council. Is the Minister aware of that? It was certainly covered in the national media. Will there be an external audit or investigation? I would be very concerned about any State body, particularly a State body in receipt of €56.9 million, having a member of staff who could be involved in the payment of a grant to an immediate family member.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I thank the Deputy for his questions. Considerable work was put into the report Utilising the Arts to Combat Disadvantage. It is in my Department now and we will work with the relevant stakeholders in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> I agree with the Deputy that local authority arts officers play a major role in making the arts more accessible to everyone. They do a really good job. Last Monday week I met them and the heritage officers. It was very good to hear their views on the issues they had to raise. That is a great role that we have with the local arts officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> I have constantly said that I want the 1916 centenary commemorations to be inclusive, respectful and appropriate. Last Wednesday week we launched an overarching plan that will allow for consultation over the next three months. I really want people to engage with this, because it is about the people. We want people to visit our website, where they can log their interests and add their views. I also want to hear the suggestions and views of members of this committee. I very much want this to be inclusive. The period of consultation is three months and I fully intend to engage with the Oireachtas group - Deputy Catherine Murphy is a member of that committee - and with the expert panel.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> The Deputy mentioned the video that was a backdrop on the night. There have been some comments on it. It was one of a number of displays on the evening of the launch. It was part of a suite of materials, including the booklet, the outline programme and the information sheets on the capital projects, which were made available by the project team for the launch of the Ireland 2016 programme. The material also supplemented official speeches delivered by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and me. So it was only one part of a bigger package.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> I have said what I said about Moore Street. My role is to protect the national monument as it is laid out now. It was very disappointing, but I am happy to do what I can and work with whoever wants to try to progress this. I was down there with the traders. It would be very nice if this project could be ready for 2016. If something is not done, the buildings will continue to fall into disrepair. It would be a huge boost to the area if this project could be developed. I saw the video, and the proposed layout, including an interpretive centre, is very impressive. I hope something can be done to move this on.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> Members of the Arts Council are being remunerated because new members get the same as the old members. If we want to change that, the legislation must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> The Deputy mentioned the issue regarding a member of staff and a grant payment. The staff member was not involved in a payment situation. The matter was fully investigated and addressed by the council. The application in question was withdrawn. There was no adverse finding and no resources were at issue in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">I understand the positions on the Arts Council were advertised by the Minister's predecessor and were described as being <i>pro bono</i> positions. If people did not apply because they understood the positions were <i>pro bono</i> and it has now transpired that the members are being remunerated, how can the Minister reconcile that? Is the Department, the Minister or the Arts Council at risk of legal challenge from somebody who might have applied had he or she known the position would be remunerated and now finds that the successful applicants are being remunerated? There seems to be a significant inconsistency in that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> On the issue of the payment of the grant, is the Minister telling us that an official was involved in the process whereby a grant was to be paid, but when the matter was discovered the application was then withdrawn and the grant not paid?</p>

It could not be on a <i>pro bono</i> basis until the legislation was changed because all members of the Arts Council had to be treated the same. I did not see the advertisement at the time but it was on the basis that the Government's intention was that it would be <i>pro bono</i>.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_154">I welcome the Minister, the Minister of State and the others present with them today. The role of the Government is to encourage the arts and create an environment where artists can thrive. If one connects the arts with the 1916 commemorations, which are about our strike for freedom, one can see that the arts are a very important and significant way to give value to that freedom.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> On the report mentioned by the Minister, I understand that perhaps there is some resistance to playing a role in combatting social disadvantage among some people operating in the arts and the powers that be. However, it is important that the arts be involved, because they help us to look at things differently. This is important not just for those who are socially disadvantaged, however we define that, but also for those who are not so disadvantaged, as it may affect how they relate to people in that situation. We cannot underestimate the power of the arts in relation to racism, social disadvantage or whatever else. It can turn many prejudices on their head, and we must use it as a tool. The arts should be available to the general population because the value in the work of the artists and those who uphold the arts must be shared. The money is taxpayers' money, so pressure must be applied to measure how those involved in the arts deliver on outreach to people who are not necessarily from an arts background, so that they get the benefit of it, while still supporting our artists and the art organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> On the 1916 commemorations, it must be said from the outset, even as we tentatively discuss it here at the Minister's first meeting of this committee, that she will not win on this. While we all enjoy the benefits of the freedom we have now, emanating from that point in our history, we also come from different traditions, ideologies and so on, so we must allow for that. The Minister's approach is very conciliatory, drawing circles of inclusiveness around everybody, because no one group, viewpoint or ideology owns these commemorations. As we move forward, we should reflect. The events in question are now many generations back. We cannot say we have the same perspective in our society as people had then, but we must be respectful. The most important aspect of this is how we celebrate the hard-earned freedom we obtained after being under British rule for so long. What have we done with this freedom? What value has it been to our citizens?</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I will ask the Minister a question, which is the nub of what I want to talk about. In my view, people in 1916 were fighting for freedom, so that we could engage in self-determination as individuals, as families and as a nation. Have we now reached a point, especially during the Celtic tiger, where a belief has been cultivated that the State will step into every gap? The State cannot make up all the shortcomings in a person's life. My concern is that I see not so much socialist ideals expressed through the democratic process, but a retrograde socialism that seeks to impair freedoms that we have won, such as we have seen in these water demonstrations and at Jobstown. I am putting that out there, that in terms of-----</p>

          <p eId="para_170">I will start with the 1916 commemorations. I was not a Deputy at the time, but would the Minister agree that the centenary of 1913, for example, seemed to be virtually ignored by the State and the Government in terms of working-class history in this city? Will the role of James Connolly and the Irish Citizen Army, for example, or the international context of 1916 be featured? The latter is very important in the sense that it was seen as an anti-war revolt as well. Given what we have seen so far by the Government, as has been mentioned before, will big business be featured in these commemorations in a way it should not be? For example, I did not know Google was in the GPO, but it seems it was if one looks at the first Government event held, which featured Google more than the Proclamation.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> There has been no change whatsoever in the arts budget, despite the Minister's statement that the arts are very important in Irish life. She gave a quote about artists being the bedrock of our culture. I was contacted by an artist in my own constituency who was not impressed that all of the €4 million increase in funding was going to 1916. I agree with him, because it is two years away. Artists must work on a day-to-day basis. He made the point that they do not have heating for their studios, they cannot afford materials for their work, and they are at the pin of their collars. They had hoped this budget would signal an end to austerity for artists, but it does not. That was in an e-mail directly from a working artist. Everyone agrees with the artists' tax exemption, which allows people to work full-time as artists without being crippled with tax, but would the Minister not consider differentiating between the Bonos and the people on the ground? It seems to apply across the board, even when people are multi-millionaires, and that comes across as ludicrous to any ordinary person.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> This being the first chance we have had to interview the Minister since she was appointed, it would be remiss not to say that her start was inauspicious in relation to the IMMA controversy. She should acknowledge that people saw that as being extremely negative and that it seemed the Government was using cultural institutions as playthings. I hope this signals the end of that. In addition, the Minister mentioned that she was setting up something in Cavan-Monaghan, which I think is her own constituency. Perhaps she can clarify that.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">The arts officers will play a crucial role in the 2016 commemorations, particularly, as Deputy Mulherin said, to bring it outside Dublin. It is not all about Dublin - it is about the whole country.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The county councils have excellent databases of local historical societies, heritage groups and so on and we will use that medium to connect with all those organisations. Most councils are doing that already because I have attended a large number of events across the country. For example, I was in Ballina for the Cumann na mBan event. I also attended the commemorations in Castlebar where they set up a fabulous website for the decade of commemorations. That is a great medium through which we can link in to people throughout the country, and I intend to use it in terms of the 2016 commemorations.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">Yes. We will work with the schools. We plan to connect with the schools through the Department of Education and Skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Regarding the 1913 commemorations, we commemorated the Lock-out, and quite a number of events were organised. There was a huge programme of acts supported by my Department in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> On the international context of 1916, we will connect with all the embassies and the diaspora. It has been mentioned that we should look across Europe because 1916 was a huge time of change across Europe. We will be exploring links that we can make with other countries. That is something the expert advisory group mentioned, and we will work on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> Mention was made of big businesses. Businesses will not be sponsoring the State events but I do not want to say there will not be any sponsorship because on many occasions a local business would want to support and be associated with an event. I attended an event in the museum in Ypres where Google has sponsored the recording of all the Irish who were lost in the First World War. There is also an opportunity for graduates to go there to study. In that respect we can sometimes marry with businesses on this issue to achieve a good outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> In terms of funding for the institutions, this is the first time in six years there has not been a cut in funding. In terms of my job, as the economy improves I hope I will be able to look for more money for the arts. I assure you I will be doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> On the artists exemption, we got that increased in the last budget. It was €40,000 and is now increased to €50,000 for artists so they can earn up to €50,000 per annum tax free.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">It is capped at €50,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Regarding the Ulster Canal, which stretches from upper Lough Erne to Castle Saunderson, we hope to get the project started on that section because that is the one part of the inland waterway system that has not been developed. If we get that done, the Ulster Canal will connect into Lough Neagh. That means we will have a complete network of waterways in Ireland, which is very important. It is also a cross-Border project, and there is a peace dividend in terms of that project. It is very important in terms of cross-Border relationships. It is one shovel-ready project that can be progressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> On the issue of the IMMA appointment, I appointed John McNulty and Sheila O'Regan on merit and I stand over that decision. I am committed to using the new system through <i>State Boards.ie</i> and I have written to the chairpersons of all national cultural institutions asking for the skill set required by them for people who might sit on their boards. I will be using that system in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_187">I am very pleased to see both the Minister and the Minister of State here. I made the suggestion because we have two sets of Ministers and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht tends to be the poor relation, which should not be the case. The attendance of so many people here today demonstrates that this area should get more attention than it does from this committee and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> The national cultural policy is very welcome. It will have a local and a national dimension but I am concerned about where our cultural institutions will be by then because we already have a very serious problem. The National Museum of Ireland is considering charging for the first time. The National Library of Ireland said that only 1% of its collections can be conserved to best international practice. There are 70,000 boxes of State records uncatalogued in the National Archives of Ireland and while they are not at risk, that is not the way the National Archives should function.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> I compliment the people who work in all three of those institutions who have been performing miracles for the funding with which they have been provided. While it might be welcome that there has not been a funding cut, what is most unwelcome is that this is the Department that has sustained the greatest level of cuts over the years of austerity. All of us should be very concerned about the national cultural institutions and while the local is vitally important in terms of our heritage, our national cultural institutions should have sufficient money to function.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> Regarding the decade of centenaries, I am on the consultative committee where there is a great focus, and rightly so, on the centrepiece that is the commemoration of 1916 in 2016. There will probably be opportunities to do a great deal outside the capital with regard to other elements of that decade of centenaries. The centrepiece will be Dublin and while there are some welcome developments with regard to the pension records, Kilmainham Gaol, the GPO and so on, it is not clear if there will be sufficient time for the consultative process and then to plan events, given the tight timeframe. The Minister might indicate when that consultative process will be completed. In terms of the submissions that are made, what timeline are people working to? It will be very difficult for people not knowing if money will be available or if they will have sufficient time to organise events. It has been left very late.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I stated at the consultation committee that we need to have a wide vision around this decade of centenaries. We have not had that big visionary moment not just in terms of looking at the short-term in a pragmatic way, but the longer-term outcome and how the arts can play a role in that. For example, I felt envious of the debate that took place in Scotland on the referendum on independence. We need to have that vision in terms of the kind of country we want to create. The people who took to the streets in 1916, including some of my ancestors, had that vision. They wanted something better. If there is a Department that can articulate that, it has to be the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht because it is the Department that should be able to capture the soul of the country. That is why we should be concerned about our national cultural institutions. This is the time they should be funded and resourced because people are paying attention. I am seriously concerned that the view is that we just have to get it over with rather than embrace it, so to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Some very good work was done on <i>genealogy.ie</i>. The indexes for the general register were put up on the website, but they have been taken down and not reappeared. It is very unfortunate, but we need to know when it will happen. Will the Minister outline the consultation process she envisages on national cultural policy and the decade of centenaries?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FiachMacConghail" eId="spk_65">
          <from>Senator Fiach Mac Conghail<recordedTime time="2014-11-25T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_193">I welcome the Minister. She and I have exchanged ideas in the Seanad in the last while. I will repeat some but not all of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Joe McHugh, chomh maith. Is iontach an comhartha é de athnuachan a chuid Gaeilge go bhfuil sé in ann é seo a dhéanamh agus molaim go mór é as ucht an dul chuige atá aige ó thaobh sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> I have five simple questions and will keep my contribution short. I support absolutely Deputy Catherine Murphy in her concern about the national cultural institutions. For the record and the purposes of dealing with conflict of interest issues, I am the director of a national cultural institution - the Abbey Theatre. Notwithstanding this, the sword of Damocles has been hanging over the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland and it is of deep concern to all of us that support is given to them. On that basis and without adding additional questions to Deputy Catherine Murphy's, I note my question on the centenary.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> I note that the 1916 Rising was the culmination of a cultural revolution that had started at the end of the 19th century. Any sidelining of contemporary art and artists would hollow out the impact of the commemoration in 2016. I would like to hear what role the Minister considers artists will have in the commemoration and what role the Arts Council will have. The €4 million about which we are talking is clearly not enough. It should really have gone to the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland to physically stay open. How can we plan and what is the central role of artists? As I noted in the Seanad, there is great relief the Minister has announced the centenaries as it appeared there was paralysis. We can now get involved in disagreements. Disagreement is good. Disagreeing about the memories of 1916 is good and how artists interpret history and the future is important. The centrality of contemporary artists is important, but I have not heard enough from the Minister on this issue. Is she consulting the Arts Council on it?</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> My second question is based on the second recommendation in the committee's report which was published in June this year. It was also a significant recommendation at the Global Irish Economic Forum at Dublin Castle in October 2013. I refer to research and data. I do not expect the Minister to have an answer, but I would like her or her officials to come back to us on the role of data and research and how we can collate them. All I ask for is a promise to come back to the committee with a response. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North has a full-time economist working on data, the funding of the arts, the impact of the arts and how research can support not only new language but also new arguments that move away from those on economics, jobs, tourism and bed nights to permit growing self-confidence around supporting and increasing the arts. I want the Minister's commitment that she will come back within a reasonable time with a response from her officials on recommendation No. 2 in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> My third question relates to the Minister's commitment to look at the National Concert Hall Bill. The committee is reporting back to her on that issue. Does she have any other legislation planned for introduction during her term of office that relates to national cultural institutions?</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> I turn to my fourth question. I commend and wholeheartedly support Culture 2025. Is there anything the committee can do to help? I note that the Minister will be issuing a paper in the new year for public consultation and urge her to ensure artists will be central to it, not administrators, politicians or even me. Artists should be included in the middle to drive it and support the Minister in articulating a future vision for 2025. I would like a commitment from her in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> My final question relates to my support for the tax exemption for artists. The issue is that the majority of artists earn less than the average industrial wage. A cap of €50,000 in one year would actually help the millionaires but not young artists who might receive an advance for a novel or a major public art commission in one year. That a young artist might receive €50,000 may seem like a lot, but when one spreads it over three years, it becomes ridiculous. I am concerned that the Department of Finance is looking at reviewing the tax relief in 2015 with "abolition on the table". What has the Minister done in the background? How can we help her to retain the exemption in 2015? While it absolutely needs reform, as Deputy Ruth Coppinger said, we support artists who are on the bread line and the poverty line. We should positively discriminate in favour of artists and it may be that even a figure of €100,000 is not so considerable when aggregated over three to four years. This is not about tax avoidance but about encouraging artists to keep at their work and retain their dignity and integrity. The cap should be based on an aggregate figure as opposed to a single year. I know artists who received €50,000 for a particular project but who had no other earnings in the next couple of years. Of course, they are going to pay tax on it. </p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Those are my five questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">If I miss a question, I ask members to come back to me. </p>
          <p eId="para_203"> I will start with the artists' exemption. It was good news to have it increased this year from €40,000 to €50,000. I accept fully what Senator Fiach Mac Conghail is saying about its aggregation over a five year term, given the drop in the incomes of artists. I agree with him and we will take up the matter with the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> I was asked about the role of the Arts Council and the national cultural institutions in the 2016 programme. We have proposals from the Arts Council and all of the cultural institutions and are going to move on them. We very much want them to be involved. The arts bring another dimension to the programme and it is important to use them to look forward also. They can cross boundaries that the spoken word cannot and they should be very much involved in the 2016 commemorations. That is why I took the opportunity when I was meeting arts officers separately on their own issues to say I wanted to discuss the 2016 commemorations with them to see how they could become involved. Artists and the arts will play a significant role in 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Cultural capital was mentioned. I was in New Orleans only a few weeks ago when I saw how greatly the people there valued their culture and the arts. This has a hugely positive effect on the economy there. I met the mayor who gave us a document on how they valued the arts and how they translated into economic activity in the city. Investment in the arts has made a huge difference and brought long-term benefits, a point on which I agree with Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> I was asked about legislation. The draft heads of two Bills are with the committee on the museum and galleries. The National Concert Hall Bill is my priority. The other two are at pre-legislative scrutiny stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">Yes, we are waiting for the pre-legislative scrutiny process to conclude.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> To respond to Deputy Catherine Murphy, the National Archives storage is being developed in the next five years. This multi-million euro capital project will deliver state-of-the-art archival storage space for public records.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> On funding for the national cultural institutions, I am conscious of the difficulties the institutions have experienced. As I stated, this year, for the first time in six years, their funding has not been cut. I accept, however, that this may not be great comfort to them. I want to work with them. Having met all of the chairpersons, I am aware of their concerns. My Department continues to engage with them and we are doing everything possible to help them. As the economy improves, there is no doubt that they will receive increased funding. </p>
          <p eId="para_211"> I was asked about the consultation process for the 2016 commemorations. A sum of €4 million has been allocated for this purpose in 2015. The consultation process will be completed in March 2015 and we will then collate the relevant material. The findings will be published and funding allocations made in the second quarter of 2015.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">If the consultation process concludes in March 2015, it will probably take another two months to study the submissions and produce a report, which would bring us to May 2015. That would leave only nine months or thereabouts before the start of the commemorations. Even modest events organised at local level require a decent lead-in time. This timeframe imposes limits on what can be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> The Minister responded to my comments on the National Archives. While it is one thing to have a capital project, specialist personnel are also needed in the National Library of Ireland, the National Archives and the National Museum of Ireland. The Minister has referred to the case of New Orleans and the economic return the city generates from culture and the arts. The national cultural institutions exist on oxygen because their funding has been cut to the bone. They are at risk and this should be acknowledged.</p>

We will not have to wait until the end of the process before commencing work. While I accept that the timeframe is short, a dedicated project team has been established for the 2016 commemorations. We will work on the issue in the meantime.</p>

Tá €2 mhilliúin curtha ar leataobh i mbuiséad Údarás na Gaeltachta agus tá an Roinn ag iarraidh ar an údarás dul ar aghaidh le togra gan an cómhaoiniú a bheith aontaithe ó na Ranna eile.

          <p eId="para_226">I welcome the Minister and the Minister of State to the committee. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is very interested in pursuing the arts in education charter, and it is something which is also close to my heart. Will she update us on the progress made in her communications with the Department of Education and Skills and the short to medium-term targets for the charter? A number of cities are bidding to be the European capital of culture 2020, including my own. When will this process begin?</p>

In July this year the relatives of the 1916 leaders released a statement that they were very supportive of the Government's decision to proceed with the preservation of the four buildings. Has their view on this changed? Are they in support of the urban battlefield idea? If this is the case, I presume there is no funding for it because it would involve the preservation of the alleyways and the entire area on Moore Street. The original idea was to be financed by NAMA. I have much sympathy for the Minister, as she has worked quite hard behind the scenes on resolving the issue, but it looks like it is now an issue for Dublin City Council to resolve, although I know the Minister will do whatever she can informally behind the scenes. She outlined the fact she has no statutory function in this regard. It would be a shame to see a project such as this not come to fruition when one sees the plans put in place with regard to the historical trail from the GPO to Kilmainham courthouse and jail. Will the Minister consider putting in place an independent person who may be able to convene a meeting, if it were helpful, with the families to try to resolve the issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> With regard to the centenary in general, the Minister mentioned it will be spread throughout the country. It would be appropriate to leave a legacy, which was mentioned by other members, by commissioning high-quality landmark arts projects in the spirit of the ethos of 1916, in particular of the artists, musicians and poets of the time who helped shape our identity. It would be very fitting and a very good way to spend money, which I know is not in great supply, to have a legacy in the regions and cities. Arts officers would work very well on commissioning such arts projects.</p>

Cé nach bhfuil aon ról agam sa phróiseas sin, tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh freagra agus toradh dearfach ó na boird sin. Maidir leis an bpróiseas atá ar bun, ba mhaith liom go mbeadh ceangal idir an bpobal agus na páirtithe leasmhara éagsúla agus go mbeidís ag obair le chéile, ó bhun go barr, ar an togra seo.

Sa chomhthéacs sin, tá plé ar bun ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta i gcomhair le Roinn an Taoisigh agus páirtithe leasmhara éagsúla, institiúidí an Aontas Eorpaigh san áireamh, ar mhaithe le moltaí sonracha a fhorbairt maidir leis an gcur chuige is fearr i dtaca leis an maolú.

          <p eId="para_237">In response to Senator Naughton’s question on the arts in education charter, the aim of the charter is to increase the number of artists in residence, conduct national art school initiatives, work with the cultural institutions educational departments, co-fund arts training for teacher training, build a best practice portal, and support the implementation committee.  It has met 27 times to conduct hearings.  I am very committed to the issue.  In conjunction with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O’Sullivan, I met the committee chaired by Professor John Coolahan.  We were both newly appointed as Ministers and we wanted to show our support for the arts in education charter.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">  I will provide an update on the European capital of culture.  I intend to seek Government approval in the coming weeks for Ireland to exercise its right to submit a nomination for the European capital of culture for 2020.  Subject to that I will issue an open invitation for interested cities to put forward their candidature for consideration.  The designation of European capital of culture is much sought after and highly prized.  It is one of the best known EU initiatives.  A lead-in time of several years is required for application, development of the plan, selection process designation and preparation before the start of the capital of culture year.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">  I have met two different groups of families in connection with the Moore Street site.  Both have very different views.  One group is very supportive of the development of the project in Moore Street, and the other is against it.  I am very clear about my job, which is to protect the monument, Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street.  The matter is before Dublin City Council.  Reference was made to a legacy of arts projects in terms of commemorations.  That will be part of the overall discussions with the Arts Council.  We would like to have projects organised in conjunction with the commemoration of 2016.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">Before I go to Senator Ó Murchú I wish to ask the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, about the tender for the Long Island ferry. Two tenders were sent to the Department. The Department wrote back to both of the companies who tendered, terminating the tendering process. Could the Minister of State explain why that was the case?</p>

          <p eId="para_241">I thank the Chairman for tabling this question. I had a chance to discuss it with the officials prior to the meeting. The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has a contract with Mr. Maurice Coughlan for the period from 1 December 2011 to 30 November 2014 for the provision of a passenger ferry service between Long Island in Cork and the mainland. As the contract was coming to an end, the Department sought tenders for a new contract through a public tendering process, advertised in the normal way on eTenders. The term of the new contract was to be from 1 December 2014 to 30 November 2019, ministerial approval having been granted for the new contract to cover a five-year period rather than a three-year period, as is currently the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> The deadline for receipt of tenders was 15 August 2014. After that date a tender assessment committee was established to assess the tenders. Having worked through the assessment process it was the committee’s view that there were issues within the tenders received. The committee sought the advice of the Department’s evaluation unit, the Office of Government Procurement and the Chief State Solicitor’s Office on the most appropriate course of action. The legal advice was the tendering process should be terminated and that a new tender competition should be advertised. To achieve a solution, the Department was left with no choice but to extend the current contract for a period. Ministerial approval was obtained to extend the current contract for four months up until 31 March 2015. The Department advertised for tenders for a five-year contract to commence on 1 April 2015. That is not unprecedented. As the procurement process for the contract is under way, and based on legal advice, it would not be appropriate to give any details regarding issues relating to the previous tenders.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">Both of the tender providers tendered for the contract previously and were awarded it. What changed in the meantime? The correspondence to one of the providers - I presume to both - stated the determination on the basis of financial projections included indicated that no suitable tender was received and consequently the tender process had been terminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Both have tendered for the contract before and have won it at various stages under the very same process. I am familiar with one of the operations. I am not a financial expert. The provider would argue there would not be any difficulty in terms of the robustness of the financial case included or the wider financial circumstances around the individual concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> Would it not be normal practice is such situations for the Department to contact the tenderers and facilitate a re-submission or give them an idea of where they have gone wrong? I understand that was the case in the past. Why was this not done in this case?</p>

          <p eId="para_246">I am conscious of the tendering process which is up and running again. The Chairman may have information which he regards as important but with respect to the details of the tender, it would not be appropriate for me to comment. I do not have any input into the tendering process when it is under way. The tendering process goes through its appropriate process.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> In reply to the Chairman's second question, under public procurement rules there is a requirement to adhere strictly to the rules. There is an issue but I am not aware of the specific issue. It is not appropriate for me to say anything but if the Chairman is of the view that he has information which would be helpful, my officials can discuss it with him.</p>

          <p eId="para_251">I thank the Minister for a very wide-ranging presentation. Many of the items which she mentioned tend to interact. It is interesting how most of them tend to refer back to the 1916 commemoration, and that is as it should be. If we are talking about culture, art and the Irish language, they were all particular elements relating to the 1916 Rising.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> We should all work towards creating as much unity as possible in regard to this commemoration. There are some misunderstandings in the public domain which can be addressed in a simple and straightforward manner. Some of these come, perhaps, from the vacuum which was created because the programme had not been brought forward, although this is not anyone's fault. I believe that there is a growing interest among the public in this commemoration, for all kinds of reasons. First, it led us towards our independence, and second, it is because of the number of relatives whose ancestors fought in 1916. There is always that community aspect of any commemoration which could very well be the bedrock of a very successful commemoration. We should work towards as much unity as possible. That does not mean we have to be uniform. As mentioned at this meeting, many people have different ideas and perhaps different experiences of and relationships with 1916. All of those can be accommodated without any great degree of difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> It is a pity that the question of the presence of a royal personage at the 1916 commemoration was put forward at such an early date. We had an even worse scenario, if I might use that word, which was the idea that we were going to have a company of the British Army marching down O'Connell Street. That gained a certain level of credence as well. To some extent that has distracted from the building of a real commemoration, much of which has been sidelined at the moment. It was also a pity that the historians got involved at too late a date or so late, because they could have played a very significant role in the debate. I refer to Diarmaid Ferriter's contribution in this regard. What is important is that, whatever misunderstandings have arisen, these should be laid aside because the one thing we do not want is to debase this commemoration through disunity and disharmony. We have to do something about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> I put forward the notion of a people's commemoration in a broader sense. Another group refers to a citizens' commemoration but I think a people's commemoration will happen anyway. There will not be an area in Ireland where there is not some activity which will reflect that community's interaction with the commemoration. This interaction and activity will be very strong. The people's commemoration should not be rewrapped in some way that it is intended as opposition to the State commemoration. This should be a partnership along every yard of the way and I think this will happen anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> On the Moore Street issue, I am disappointed at the situation. Many people invested much time in this concept and project over a number of years. We are at a stage where instead of being able to say we are making progress, we have people taking opposing positions. I urge the Minister, arising out of her own comments but I have made this point at previous meetings of this committee, that there should be a round-table private discussion with the city council, the Department and the families. I do not have any doubt that it would work.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> I suggest the solution would be along the lines that we would go along with the Minister's proposal for Moore Street but that the idea of the battle site could be considered at a future date and in other circumstances. We have to accept that it is regarded as one of the most important battle sites in Europe. The National Museum of Ireland has made this point. We should not become bogged down as to whether it is the whole battle site or the buildings. There is great potential in what the Minister has said about the plans for the buildings. However, if the other issue is not put to bed, it will be a distraction from the buildings. I am confident that a solution can be found with the city council, the Department and the families involved. I have had a lot of connection with them over recent years. I introduced them to a former Taoiseach who met them. I know that whatever is happening here and the friction which is developing is not a friction that can be laid aside. I urge the Minister, even though it might seem like a difficult task, and I do not mean in saying this that there should be cameras or newspapers present, to have a private discussion with representatives of the city council and everybody else in order that there can be a full understanding of what is on offer. I do not think there is yet a full understanding of what is on offer. The concerns of those who want to go further can certainly be laid to rest by the idea of moving forward at a further stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> I wish to make a point on the Irish language. The committee had a meeting today with the language commissioner from Wales, Meri Huws. We had a very good meeting with her. We went to Wales five or six weeks ago and we met the First Minister, with the Arts Council, with the Eisteddfod and with the commissioner. We had a very prolonged two days of work. What struck me very forcefully was the similarities between Wales and Ireland. In fact, it was said to us that their language Act is based on our language Act to a large degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Today, the commissioner offered to meet with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, to chat with him about her views. There is a global body of ten language commissioners whose meetings she attends, so she would not only be dealing with the Welsh experience, but also with that of the other commissioners. It would be very worthwhile to take her up on that offer. The new language Bill must bring on board all those who have supported its previous incarnation, which was unanimous in the Oireachtas - as was the 20-year strategy - and interestingly brought all the language organisations with it. The Minister knows as well as I do that I have only ever had the objective of keeping politics out of the language. It belongs to no political party. It belongs to the people and is central to the 1916 commemoration. I am slightly afraid that if we do not keep the goodwill that is there, the political divisiveness which I have not seen in almost 20 years may come back again. I ask that the Minister consider this in the interest of broadening the debate on the language Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> I fully support the charter for the arts, which I think is a wonderful idea. My own organisation, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, is very deeply involved. We are interacting with the schools as was intended in the charter and have now introduced our latest initiative, TradTime, into 100 schools. We are providing the back-up teachers and so on and the initiative is being expanded. The Minister for Education and Skills is to meet me to see how we can develop it further. There is a waiting list for schools wanting to come in. It is exceptionally successful and is tax compliant. It has all the elements the Minister of State requires and I was glad to hear him mention it today. It is something we could build on in a big way.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">I support what Senator Ó Murchú has said regarding Moore Street. We need to find a resolution. If everybody is around the table and they stay there until they solve it, I have no doubt they will do so. Between now and 2016, it would also be a good idea to develop a trail of all the 1916 sites around Dublin and around the country. County Kerry is involved because of Roger Casement, County Galway because of Liam Mellows, and so are County Wexford, County Laois and many other places. It would be a good idea to develop a trail, for Irish people and people from abroad, so that all of the sites could be brought together. In the case of Dublin, I am envisioning a walking trail, a green line down the streets leading to all the sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach a thuiscint nach mbeadh an méid a tharla i 1916 murach an teanga. Níl aon amhras faoi sin. Cuir i gcás cinnirí 1916. Ní bheidís gafa le polaitíocht murach go raibh baint acu le Conradh na Gaeilge; Eoin Mac Néill go deimhin. Pádraic Mac Piarais agus go leor eile acu chomh maith céanna. Taispeánadh pictiúr cúpla bliain ó shin san <i>Galway Advertiser</i>. Baineadh an pictiúr le daoine a bhí ag an Oireachtas. Bhí an oiread acu san gafa nó páirteach san Éirí Amach ina dhiaidh sin. Ba thragóid é dá ndéanfaimis iarracht céiliúradh a dhéanamh - is comóradh atá á dhéanamh ar 1916 - gan rud éigin a dhéanamh don teanga ag an am céanna. Bheinn ag súil mar chuid de chomóradh 1916 go gcuirfear an t-airgead breise - caipitil agus reatha - a theastaíonn ón Údarás ar fáil. </p>
          <p eId="para_262"> Is dóigh liom, thar aon rud eile ó thaobh 1916, agus le hómós a thaispeáint do chinnirí 1916, gurb é an rud is mó go bhféadfaí a dhéanamh ná an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm go hiomlán. Cloisim an rud seo: "De réir mar a bheidh acmhainní ar fáil". Beidh acmhainní ar fáil amach anseo ach b'fhéidir nach mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga baile láidir a thuilleadh san Ghaeltacht. Dá gcuirfí €3 milliún nó €4 milliún breise ar fáil as caiteachas an Rialtais, b'é an rud céanna le teaghlach le hioncam de €50,000 ag cur €3 ar fáil do rud éicint. B'shin an t-ionannas a bheadh ann - €3 breise a chur ar fáil. Is ionann €3 breise do theaghlach le €50,000 do chaiteachas agus €3 milliún ó thaobh an Stáit. Ní dóigh liomsa go bhfuil leithscéal ar bith ann agus muid ag déanamh comóradh ar 1916 a bheith ag caint ar acmhainní a bheith mar fhadhb. Ba mhaith liom ceist an-díreach a chur ar an Aire Stáit. An lagú nó láidriú a bheidh i gceist leis na leasuithe ar an Acht teanga?</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> My view is that the Proclamation should be at the centre of the 1916 commemorations. It mentions "Irishmen and Irishwomen" three times. It specifically mentions the "happiness and prosperity of the whole nation" and an Irish Government "elected by the suffrages of all her men and women". It is a very democratic document. The argument they had, of course, was that the Irish men and women were not getting the choice of picking their own form of government. The most misquoted phrase in the Proclamation is about "cherishing all the children of the nation equally", "oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past". This is specifically alluding to reconciliation within this island between the Unionist and Nationalist traditions. There is nothing in that Proclamation that needs to be discarded, which is extraordinary given the events of the past 100 years. It actually says it all, and therefore our challenge is not the Proclamation - in my view, that can stay at the centre - but the implementation of the Proclamation. Any commemoration that does not have it as the central theme is not being true to 1916.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Would it be possible for the Minister of State to suggest to his colleague in the Department of Education and Skills that the 1916 Easter Week Commemoration Scholarship be reinstated forthwith? I cannot for the life of me understand cén fath gur cuireadh deireadh le scoláireachtaí 1916 ach sílim go mba cheart go gcuirfí ar ais iad. There should also be a schools programme around the events of 1916. </p>
          <p eId="para_265"> I welcome the Minister's continuation of the work on the Ulster canals. There was quite a bit of work done on that in my time and I was very anxious to see it progress on a step-by-step basis. I was going to bring it to Clones, I am not sure whether the place the Minister mentioned is further or nearer than that.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">I take the view that even if she were to get it half a mile, we should just nibble away at it until we get it finished. It is of strategic national importance and if we could connect Coleraine, where I was the other day and where my poor car is getting mended, all the way down the coast through Lough Neagh down to Shannon and back up the canals, it would be a fantastic facility for the island. I will not be heard complaining in any way that it is in the Minister's constituency - that just happens to be a happy coincidence in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> Ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Aire Stáit go bhfuil tuilleadh bunstruchtúir ag teastáil ar na hoileáin. Tá cé d'Inis Oírr ag teastáil go géar. Tá pleanáil ann don chéibh sin. B'shin an t-aon chéibh amháin fágtha ag an Rialtas le déanamh. Tá an chuid eile ar fad déanta.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Níl sé sabháilte. Má théann an tAire Stáit ann i lár an gheimhridh, tuigfidh sé é sin. Beidh na tonnta cearta ar chuan na céibhe, isteach ar an gcéibh agus caithfear duine sa fharraige. Maraíodh beirt in Inis Meáin ach tógadh cé nua ann. Ach tarlóidh tubaiste in Inis Oírr fós. Agus cuirfí an cheist ansin, "Cén fáth nuair a bhí gach rud eile déanta nach ndearnadh an chéim sin?". Teastaíonn clár forbartha bunstruchtúir ar na hoileáin. Mar a dúradh cheana, dá mbeadh €3 milliún nó €4 milliún in aghaidh na bliana ann, dhéanfadh sé.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> Luadh bád Inis Oírr. Tá fadhb ollmhór fós ann. Glacaim leis go bhfuil an bád ann ach tá muintir na n-oileán seo ag íoc i bhfad níos mó ar na ticéid ná mar atá na daoine ar aon oileán eile. Tá sé sin le feiceáil go mormhór i leith leanaí scoile ag dul go cluichí peile agus imeachtaí eile ar an mórthír. Teastaíonn sé go géar go mbeidh na ticéid ar aon phraghas leis na ticéid do na hoileáin eile. Mé féin a thug isteach an coincheap nach bhféadfadh an ticéad d'oileán dul ós cionn phraghais áirithe. Bhí sé €8 nuair a bhí mise ann. Tá sé €10 anois. Glacaim leis sin. Ach tá sé i bhfad nios mó ná sin, tá sé €15 nó €16 ticéad fillte ar Inis Mór a cheannach, ainneoin gur as an oileán sin is mó a thagann paisinéirí. An féidir leis an Aire Stáit a rá cén uair a lorgófar tairiscintí nua don tseirbhís aeir go dtí na trí oileán Árainn? </p>
          <p eId="para_271"> Can the Minister give me an assurance that, in the event that Bord Fáilte decides not to stump up the money, the Government will just take the money from somebody, including Bord Fáilte, and give the money to the project? This is Bord Fáilte spending State money and, in such cases, an agency should have the choice of something that is a keystone in the commemoration programme. Therefore, we need a simple statement by the Government that full funding will be provided, that an agency, whether Údarás na Gaeltachta or Bord Fáilte, will be given the money, and that it will be ring-fenced for Teach an Phiarsaigh. Once and for all, this should finish the uncertainty about the funding of the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> Finally, I noticed today that there has been very little discussion about hen harriers and bog cutters. The total non-acceptance by rural people of EU regulations on habitats is a major challenge. One farmer in Connemara put it graphically when people were talking about the GLAS scheme. He said that Cromwell sent people to Connacht but at least he did not put any conditions on it. That says it all. Most rural people feel that the way the habitats directive is implemented, from Europe and in this country, inhibits people from becoming landowners and willing partners in conservation. Without the willing partnership, we will not get the desired conservation. We must think this out again and come up with a system whereby people are recognised as custodians of the national heritage. The Minister has a role to play, along with her colleague in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I was critical of the new Common Agricultural Policy because we paid lip service to high-nature farming, but when it came to-----</p>

This leaves a bad taste in people's mouths, and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will suffer the whirlwind. We must make a major move towards recognising that if people are going to be the custodians of the natural heritage, they must still put bread on the table and feed their families.</p>
