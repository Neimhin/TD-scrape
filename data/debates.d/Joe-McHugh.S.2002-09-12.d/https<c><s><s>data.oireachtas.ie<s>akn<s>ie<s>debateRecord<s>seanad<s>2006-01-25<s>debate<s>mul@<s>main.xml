          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Kitt that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the delay in approving group water schemes, public water schemes and small sewerage schemes in County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to produce an early report on the future development of the Nenagh Castle project and to agree to a meeting with members of Nenagh Town Council as already requested.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to respond immediately to the many wind farmers who are unable to gain access to the national grid because of the current management and monopoly of the ESB, and if he will clarify his responsibilities in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the reasons Bennekerry national school, County Carlow, was not included in the recent school buildings programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the time it will take to administer the new scheme for additional post-primary accommodation in Elphin community college, Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address the situation regarding the unanimous request of Killarney Town Council and numerous other interested parties for the provision of much-needed land at Church Road, Muckross, as a burial ground in the best interests of the entire community.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I have also received notice from Senator Bradford of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to urgently review her decision on risk equalisation in the health insurance industry and to ensure that competition in health insurance will be defended and promoted.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline his proposals to counteract the adverse effects, both short and long term, for home owners on the route of the designated corridor of the N4 Drumsna to Longford road improvement scheme, particularly those located on the outer fringes, as the proposed development is already affecting property sales.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I regard the matters raised by Senators Kitt, O'Meara, Ulick Burke, Browne, Feighan, Coghlan and Bradford as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Kitt, O'Meara and Ulick Burke and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Browne, Feighan, Coghlan and Bradford may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise. I regret I had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Bannon as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">The Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 2, motions which implement the increased entitlements to adoptive and maternity leave arising from the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance on 7 December 2005, to be taken without debate; No. 3, statements on a strategy for men's health, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 5 p.m., spokespersons will have 15 minutes and other Senators ten minutes, the Minister shall be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements. If some Senators do not get the opportunity to contribute we will run the debate another day; and No. 21, motion 24, to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. A supplementary Order Paper has been issued with the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_19">Since we last met one of the most historic judgments ever has been handed down from the Supreme Court, namely, on the issue of privilege. Will the Leader set aside time for a full debate, possibly next week, on that judgment? While the matter has been debated at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, it involves all Members in a non-party political way.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">The issue surrounds the case against Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin. While it is clear from the Supreme Court judgment made just before Christmas that utterances made in the House are governed by the right of privilege, the case is not so clear with regard to the private papers of Senators and Deputies. We need to debate this issue in the context of the judgment, which stated that if a resolution or a new Standing Order had been established by this House, those papers may well have been governed by privilege. This may well have ensured that the name of the informants who gave the information to the Senator and the Deputy would not have had to come out in court.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I raise this important issue because at the heart of the relationship between a citizen and a Senator or Deputy is the notion of confidentiality. Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin showed sound judgment in bringing that information to the relevant Minister to ensure the Morris tribunal of inquiry would be established. I raise this issue in a non-party political way. It is an issue that affects the 60 Members of this House because if any court of the land can, effectively, gag Members of these Houses, that is a dangerous route. The matter needs to be debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on Northern Ireland. I and others sought this debate before Christmas. This debate does not necessarily require the presence of the Taoiseach in the House. Perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his Minister of State could attend in his place. Since we last met so much has happened regarding OTRs and the possibility of progress as both Governments attempt to restart the talks with all the parties in Northern Ireland. The House should debate the issue at an opportune time.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">The Leader has stated on many occasions that this is a legislative Assembly. What new Bills are proposed to be taken in this House this session? The Chief Whip stated yesterday that 17 or 18 new Bills are proposed for this session, yet 16 Bills which have passed through this House are currently stalled in the other House. It is important that the Government uses this House as a mechanism for introducing legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_24">I support the point made by Senator Brian Hayes on privilege. Perhaps many Members of the Houses do not understand the implications it has for them. It may well be, as was evident recently, that the only way to protect information is to put it on the record of the House. This was surely never the intention of the Constitution. I therefore believe we need to examine the issue of privilege and, at the very least, have a debate on it. We also need an interpretation of how it impacts upon us at present and how we need to respond to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">On a related matter, it will soon be the second anniversary of the matters associated with Judge Brian Curtin, on which we had a long and heated debate over a period of weeks almost two years ago. I do not want to discuss the detail, and have never done so but, as I said before, the matter was being mishandled. I said the proceedings would go on forever and that we would still be considering the matter at the time of the next election. The case is now stuck in the Supreme Court. This reflects in no negative way on the Oireachtas committee. It devoted all of the summer before last to addressing the matter and did everything asked of it. As I said before, it will ultimately be blamed when things do not work out, even though it will have done its very best on our behalf. It is for this that we set it up and I congratulate it on its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">We should recognise that this issue will cost a fortune. There will be all sorts of delays and, because the case is so complicated, I do not know how many more months we will have to wait for something to come back from the Supreme Court. The Government, in its wisdom, decided not to implement the proposal of the all-party Oireachtas committee, made some years ago, for dealing with this kind of issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">It is clear that there will be a challenge at every hand's turn in this case. The Government should now be encouraged to disband the committee investigating the Judge Curtin affair and deal directly with the judge and come to some agreement with him. This matter will proceed for longer than any of the inquiries that took place in Dublin Castle if we allow it. Action needs to be taken at this stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_28">I support my colleagues on the issue of Oireachtas privilege. Perhaps in a partisan fashion I will put on the record my admiration for my colleague Deputy Howlin on his courage in pursuing, at considerable hazard to himself, the rights of Members of both Houses.</p>

Since this matter was last raised, we have learned that contrary to the assertion of the Minister for Education and Science, who stated there was no evidence of the State having any inspection role in the case of the institution which housed Marie Therese O'Loughlin, there is a letter from the Minister for Health and Children confirming that the Department of Health and Children had an inspection role.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">In the past I raised in the House the question of the abuse of fish stocks in rivers and canals. A local angler from my native Killucan recently informed me that a stretch of the Royal Canal which he fished regularly over the years is now denuded of fish, which are being caught using nets stretched between both banks of the canal. All the fish are taken out but nothing is put back. This has been happening for some time and must stop. I have discussed the issue with Senator Dardis, who is a keen fisherman, and with my party spokesperson in this area, Senator Kenneally. What is happening is a disgrace and must be tackled as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">Many of us look back with sadness at the increased number of road deaths since Christmas. To date in 2006 we have experienced the highest number of road deaths since the comparable period in 2001. The Minister for Transport has been loud on commitments with regard to introducing safety changes but anyone reading a newspaper today would know he has been very low on delivery. This is a serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">It is sad that many of the recent road deaths involve new immigrants. Many immigrants bring their cars to this country. While Irish cars are subject to the national car test which ensures they operate efficiently and effectively, are there any controls on cars brought into this country? It is an important factor. In many cases these motorists are unfamiliar with Irish roads. I would like to be assured that their vehicles are operating effectively and in accordance with the high standards of the NCT.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_50">I would like to refer to the Order Paper and the fact that the last item among the papers laid before the House is the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution's Tenth Progress Report: The Family. The Order Paper also lists my Bill, namely, the Civil Partnership Bill 2004 which deals with one of the issues in this regard. I propose substituting an amended Bill in light of the debate we had on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I would like the House to take up this matter and run with it. I have lost all confidence in the Government's commitment to developments in this area. A farcical situation is developing in that gay people in Paisley's Belfast have more civil and human rights than gay people in Bertie's Dublin. If Sean O'Casey was around, the Taoiseach would be described as a prognosticator. I met the Taoiseach 18 months ago. Following that meeting, I thought we were on the way but he kicked the issue into the Oireachtas committee dealing with the family. Now we have its report, as well as the Law Reform Commission reports on this issue, but what is the response? We have a detailed examination and a clear recommendation to proceed along the lines my Bill has proposed, yet the Government is considering another commission, committee or think-tank to examine the situation. It is putting the matter on the long finger. We are being disgraced in Europe as one of the last states to deal with this issue. Catholic Spain has full gay marriage. I will not list the other states. Let us please get on with the job. I have done the work so let the Government live up to what its committee has recommended.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">The Leader has been very positive, courageous and creative on the issue of the war in Iraq and the difficult subject of CIA renditions. Can she give us any further information on developments in this area and when the promised committee will be set up? The Marty committee has issued a worrying report. Senator Marty, the Swiss Senator chairing the committee, has clearly determined that there are more than 100 of these rendition flights over Europe and suggests that many European governments are aware of them but are turning a blind eye. Before Christmas our Human Rights Commission called on the State to inspect these flights. It is important that we examine this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Senator O'Toole mentioned the troubled question of privilege and suggested that the only way to ensure accurate and safe information is to put it on the record of the House. I have the greatest respect for the staff of the Debates Office. They do an exceptionally good job, are very courteous, professional and helpful. They do, however, sometimes massage points a little, particularly when people like me attempt to speak Irish, which they render grammatical. While this is completely acceptable we need to consider the situation and give direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">This may sound humorous but it is not intended to be. In the last week of the Dáil session the Ceann Comhairle said, "Ah for frig's sake, Enda". That was widely reported and broadcast by the media yet the comment does not appear in the Official Report because it was excised. A similar incident occurred in this House when a colleague of mine expressed concern about the high levels of adult "literacy". This was a mistake but I took it up and agreed with him saying things were frightful, people were not only learning to read but would shortly be able to write and eventually there would be Catholic emancipation. That never appeared in the Official Report because the reporter, the person in charge, decided it was too cruel.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">I had a major battle about this incident but was not supported in this House. This is an important point. I do not blame the Debates Office which is very professional. We lack guts if we do not give direction and say it is all right to correct the grammar but we must have an accurate and faithful record, particularly as the proceedings are now broadcast on television and radio.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">In 2004 the Comptroller and Auditor General published a report on public-private partnerships. One case concerned a contract for school buildings awarded to a British private development company, Jarvis, which was not the lowest bidder. The company's tender was 13% above the cost at which the Department of Education and Science would design, build and maintain an equivalent number of schools. Although this was a multimillion euro, 25-year contract the company has withdrawn after five years which jeopardises public-private partnership schemes under the Department of Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Prior to Christmas the Minister for Education and Science indicated in this House that a new tranche of schools was to be developed under a similar project to other contractors. We are told the schools involved in the Jarvis contract will not be affected because a German company has taken over the contracts. If the original company went out of business through financial difficulties there must have been shortcomings in the maintenance of the schools involved in the intervening period. Now that the resources are readily available internally, we should seek them in order to complete schools. While we know how scarce resources were for the provision, upkeep and reconstruction of schools, 13% of additional funds in a multimillion euro contract were given to this company.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">When young people try to gain access to discos and nightclubs where alcohol is served they are rightly required to present identification to prove their age. Many of them obtain so-called age cards from the Garda Síochána, but it can take from three to six months to issue such cards. This means that, in the interim, young people must present their passports in order to gain access to clubs. This situation is totally unacceptable because many passports are lost or stolen as a result. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should expedite this matter, which is being dealt with by the Garda Síochána's community services section. The section, which is mostly staffed by civilians, currently has inadequate resources. Why is it taking from three to six months to produce these cards? When students register for college such cards can be issued within a matter of hours. This should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">I am tempted to call a public meeting on the nitrates directive as I am sure that it would be very well attended. Speaking as someone from an agricultural background, I echo the sentiments of my colleague, Senator Bannon, and ask the Leader to arrange a debate. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, seemed to back down yesterday regarding the nitrates directive. It is clear to me as someone looking in from the outside that there has been a degree of political manoeuvring regarding Teagasc officers. In particular, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, does not emerge from this smelling of roses. We should have a discussion at the earliest opportunity, since the implications, especially of spreading phosphorous, could be extremely detrimental for agriculture in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">I also join with colleagues who have expressed interest in debating road safety. Senator Maurice Hayes was quite correct in saying that Northern Ireland would make a good case study. Many of the patterns of problems on the roads there are similar to what we see in this jurisdiction, and we might usefully emulate efforts there to ensure a similar reduction. Over the last few weekends, we have seen a shocking number of accidents and fatalities on the roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">In my three and a half years in the House, we have had numerous debates and expended a great deal of hot air. Even yesterday, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, held a press conference at which he announced that he would introduce two or three new Bills or amendments to existing legislation. However, a few hours later, the Chief Whip's office published the legislative programme, which contained nothing on road safety or transport. We might usefully have a discussion with the Minister for Transport to see what will happen and whether he has any real proposals to put to the House and the country to reduce the toll of fatalities and accidents on the roads.</p>

A number of Senators spoke about the scandal of what has happened. This is one example of where we know we can identify the challenge. We know the answers but we have done very little about the problem. Northern Ireland was mentioned by Senator Maurice Hayes. We have seen what happened in Australia, and in France, where the leadership of that nation decided to do something about the problem and it succeeded. We know leadership and commitment is required and that somebody must make this issue a priority. It is a scandal that has been identified by Members of this House on many occasions yet we have not seen action. It is a problem we can do something about. Those with the required leadership should be brought into this House. We should have an urgent debate because the scandal should not be allowed continue.</p>

The European information technology scale, which identifies the gap between the skills we need and those we have, indicates that Ireland will go from third to 21st place within two years.

          <p eId="para_91">I support Senator Glynn in his call for action to be taken on the matter of indiscriminate taking of fish from our waterways. He is correct in stating that nets are being used extensively. In my own area on the River Liffey, there have been cases where these nets have been used and, as the Senator stated, within a stretch all the fish are taken. When some of these people were challenged by local members of the angling club, they had not understood that what they were doing was wrong because many of them come from cultures where this is allowed. They arrived in Ireland unaware of the fact that it is illegal to take fish by nets. That is part of the difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">However, this is not to say that some of our own people are not doing the same. There have been spectacular cases in some of our famous lakes where the authorities discovered large quantities of fish had been taken. There is an enforcement issue which needs to be addressed and I ask the Leader to do what she can at Government level to ensure that enforcement takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">I support the call for a debate on road safety, around which there is an enforcement issue which is probably important. It appears that the countries that are vigilant in terms of enforcing the law are more successful in keeping down the number of road deaths. I have driven in Australia and it is significant that everybody there keeps within the speed limit all the time; it is difficult to find people who are driving fast. That is part of the difficulty here. The issue should be discussed. It was significant to note over Christmas that the figures for Northern Ireland were at a 20-year low. They are obviously doing something right and we should learn from what is happening in that jurisdiction.</p>

On the question of privilege, we all believe and would accept it is vitally important that the private papers of Members of both Houses would be protected. As Senator Brian Hayes noted, we all believe the Members involved in this action acted properly in going to the then Minister with the information they possessed rather than putting statements on the record of the House. Members must be protected. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes's argument that we will go down a very dangerous route for democracy if they are not protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Whatever judgment is handed down by the Supreme Court with regard to the case of Judge Brian Curtin, the matter will come back to the Oireachtas committee.

The vital link between parliamentarians and their constituents must be preserved and this Supreme Court judgment must be debated in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The six-week recess has taken away from the very good work carried out by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Members work extremely hard at constituency level and as legislators in this House and it is a pity to see a six-week recess detract from this work. It disguises much of the hard work that has been carried out. The recess was not a holiday; we worked very hard in our constituencies. I am aware that the Leader had a particularly gruelling six weeks and I congratulate her on coming out on the right side of it. It is important to debate this issue. House sittings must be connected to other parliaments in western Europe which have much longer sittings and are perceived to work harder by the public. We work just as hard as other parliamentarians in western Europe but the recess gives politics a bad name and adds to existing cynicism about politics.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">I welcome the report by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution and commend it on the very hard work put into the report. While members of the committee held differing views on the issue, which was acknowledged by the chairman at the launch of the report last night, the Government should act on the report's recommendations as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">I acknowledge the role played by Senators Dardis and Glynn in raising the issue of game angling. I am delighted that someone eventually highlighted the very serious problem of depleting salmon stocks in Irish rivers. The problem concerns drift and draft net fishermen and game anglers. Vigilante game anglers do not abide by certain rules. Fine Gael launched a document on a salmon charter last week. Part of it involves a voluntary buy-out of drift and draft net fishermen, a measure proposed by Deputy Perry which is taken very seriously by Fine Gael. It is time the Government bit the bullet in respect of this issue instead of establishing commission after commission and procrastinating. A total of 54,000 anglers visited Ireland in 1999, while 27,000 anglers visited the country last year. This represents a 50% reduction in the number of anglers visiting Ireland, which is an alarming trend and indicative of the seriousness of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">I agree with the call by Senator Brian Hayes and Senator Maurice Hayes for a debate on Northern Ireland. This debate should not simply address the political impasse. We need synchronisation of policy because, irrespective of whether we like it, Westminster is co-ordinating policy for Northern Ireland while Dublin co-ordinates policy at a central level here. However, we are not singing from the same hymn sheet. Mark Durkan, MLA, and Gregory Campbell, MLA, put down a motion in the House of Commons three weeks ago in respect of a high-speed train service from Belfast to Derry that included Letterkenny. They decided as representatives of Northern Ireland to include Letterkenny but what have we done in our capital as part of our transport plan? We have no railway infrastructure plans involving links between Letterkenny and Derry. It is time we woke up and began co-ordinating policy, including economic policy. There is a political impasse but we can still co-ordinate and synchronise our plans at both central levels.</p>

The problem of Northern Ireland is developing into a problem of crime. Out of the recent welcome outbreak of peace has sprung an incredible amount of cross-Border racketeering, money laundering and co-operation among the former criminals who have committed violent acts and who have diverted their energy into criminal activities of a different sort. This House should recognise the scale of that and not brush it under the carpet. I refer to pubs, hotels, bookmakers' shops, cash businesses——</p>

If voluntary clubs are doing their best to install the facilities to encourage maximum participation in sport, to which we all aspire, they should not be hindered. The GAA clubs cannot reclaim VAT on those charges.

Setting up another committee is an attempt to drag its feet. The all-party committee has published its report and legislation should follow as quickly as possible. We must legislate for all the people of this country, regardless of their sexual orientation or religion. Many people must remember that Ireland is no longer just a Roman Catholic country. The Government is dragging its feet on this matter and it needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.

We hear much talk about a balanced tourism infrastructure. The developers and architects involved met with the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the head archaeologist of Dúchas and there were no problems. Dúchas made an observation on that planning file which weighed heavily in An Bord Pleanála's decision to refuse planning permission. Was that observation made by an individual from Dúchas? Does it reflect the views of Dúchas, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister? This is a serious situation that has got out of control and must be resolved.</p>

The Senator also asked for a debate on Northern Ireland and I hope to have one very soon. He also claimed that this is a legislative assembly but that we do not pass Bills. We have processed every Bill before us and sent it on to the Dáil. The Dáil has 15 of our Bills which still must be passed in that House.

I do not know, but it is an important point since a quarter of all the recent road deaths were accounted for by immigrants from Latvia and the Czech Republic.

Social partnership has been extremely valuable for this country and it is one of the reasons for our continuing good economic growth rate.

Men have higher death rates for all leading causes of deaths and at all ages and it is projected that this pattern may worsen in the future. Given current trends, it is predicted that by 2015 one third of all men in Ireland will be clinically obese, thereby increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in particular. Should this trend continue, it is likely to impact in a significant way upon the gains made in recent years in the battle against cardiovascular disease which the Government has initiated through the cardiovascular strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">For certain groups of men the gravity of the situation is even worse. Compared with men in the highest occupational classes, men from the lower occupational classes have poorer health outcomes and experience significantly higher mortality rates for the five major causes of death in Ireland. Young men are also at particular risk — they are almost four times more likely to die prematurely than their female counterparts and currently have the second highest suicide rate of the 30 OECD member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Yet, despite their poor health profile, men in Ireland are reluctant users of health services and are continuing to present too late in the course of an illness. There is however, an increasing recognition that existing services have not always met men's needs, and that this also is a contributory factor to men's poor presentation at primary care services in particular. It should also be acknowledged that men's health has not, until recent years, become the focus of attention at a policy or service level. Indeed while men have been to the forefront of health in every way, as policy makers, doctors, surgeons, oncologists, cardiologists, hospital managers, etc., rarely has the spotlight focused on the value men place upon their own health at a personal or individual level.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">In response to this rather grave health profile of men in Ireland, men were identified for the first time in the national health promotion strategy and in the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness, as a specific population group for the strategic planning of health. The National Health Promotion Strategy 2002-2005, targets men as a population group, with the strategic aim to develop a plan for men's health. The strategy also contains a number of specific objectives which include initiating research in the area of men's health; working in partnership to inform the development of a plan for men's health; facilitating the development and implementation of current health promotion initiatives aimed at men; and identifying and developing models of working with men to promote their physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Action 15 of Quality and Fairness called for the development of "a policy for men's health and health promotion". This policy and action plan is now at an advanced stage of development. In setting out to develop such a policy, the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children has endeavoured to ensure that it will be based upon sound evidence and that it will also reflect the issues of all stakeholders regarding men's health. To achieve this goal, a three-year research study was commissioned followed by an extensive nationwide consultation process over a 12-month period.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Health boards have also begun to address men's health. Some examples of activities include the appointment of men's health development officers, the publication of a men's health strategy and a national conference on men's health. The former North Eastern Health Board has published findings from a qualitative study on men's health beliefs, attitudes and perceptions entitled Men Talking, and the former Mid-Western Health Board has published a plan for men's health. The Institute of Public Health has also published an all-Ireland men's health directory, mapping out activity in the area of men's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">In the non-statutory sector, a men's health advocacy group, the Men's Health Forum Ireland has been formed and has published a report on the health status of men in Ireland. From 2002 to 2004, the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children funded a men's health research project which was conducted in the former South Eastern Health Board area. The findings of the research entitled, Getting Inside Men's Health, were launched at a national conference on men's health which took place in December 2004. This report offered unique insights into the crucial role of gender on men's health. It demonstrated that the ways in which men perceive their health, take risks with their health and manage their health within the health care system are inherently related to how men define their masculinity.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Among the most pertinent findings from this report were that men tend not to be health conscious or proactive about their own health. Sadly, it is very often on foot of a health crisis that they only then become conscious about paying more attention to their health. Men's knowledge of fundamental health issues remains poor, for example, over a third of older men surveyed were not aware of common prostate cancer symptoms. There is an overall lack of a preventive health ethos among men in Ireland. While men are slow to access primary care services when they are sick, they are slower still to engage in preventive health checks. Indeed, the report showed clearly that men are very often afraid and anxious about seeking help, with fear and uncertainty about "what might be wrong" possibly posing a bigger threat to men's health than the reality of ill health itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Men are particularly reluctant to seek help for certain conditions. The continued stigma that is perceived to be associated with depression, for example, may prompt many men to "self medicate" with alcohol rather than to seek professional help. Men also play down the gravity of certain risk or health damaging behaviours. With regard to alcohol consumption, for example, half of those consuming over 50 units per week, that is, over twice the recommended maximum limit, considered themselves to be "moderate" drinkers, while nine out of ten weekly binge drinkers similarly considered themselves to be "light" or "moderate" drinkers.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">These are just some of findings from the report, which offered many further insights into the issues underlying the very worrying statistics on men's health. Crucially, the report drew attention to the need for a gender-specific response to men's health to replace the traditional generic approach. In other words, how men are "as men" influences their understanding and approach to their health, the extent to which they engage in preventive health behaviours or risk behaviours and how timely they are in accessing health services. The 36 specific recommendations in the report offer a clear blueprint for the development of policy and service delivery measures that are more gender-sensitive in the context of men.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">In implementing the recommendations of the health promotion strategy and Action 15 of the health strategy, a national interdepartmental and multisectoral steering group was appointed to oversee the development of the policy following the completion of the three-year research project in November 2004. Under the terms of reference of the steering group, it was agreed that the development of a men's health policy should also be informed by consultation with key stakeholders from statutory and voluntary sectors, health professionals and, indeed, men themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Under the direction of the national steering group, an extensive, three-phase national consultation process was conducted from February to December 2005. Phase 1 comprised six nationwide one-day consultation days, where all relevant stakeholders were invited to identify both the health needs for men in Ireland and appropriate actions to target these needs. Phase 2 comprised eight focus groups with particular populations of men whose voices were not represented in phase 1 of the consultation and for whom it was felt a more targeted consultation was necessary. Phase 3 invited submissions from both specific organisations and target groups and an open call for submissions through the national press.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Some of the most pertinent issues to emerge from this consultation process included the need to depart from the traditional focus on the "deficiencies" of men with respect to their health. Unfortunately, the public and media focus around men's health tends to be dominated by what has been described as the "men behaving badly" model, whereby men are blamed for failing the health services by not attending, for ignoring health messages and for taking risks. While these problems cannot be overlooked, it is clear from the consultation process that there has been insufficient focus on tackling the underlying causes of these problems or on overcoming the barriers to health within men themselves. There is a need to work with men in a more positive and holistic way and to examine how existing services can be made more responsive and gender-competent for men.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The consultation process has also highlighted the need to embrace a broader, social determinant view of men's health. While it is incumbent on a national men's health policy to promote health-affirming changes to men's attitudes and behaviours, it is fundamentally important to create supportive environments for men, for example, in the workplace, and to strengthen community action to support men's health. In the case of poorer and less-educated men, for example, we know that health outcomes are very closely linked to education, income and housing. These factors are compounded by issues such as isolation and access to services for many rural men. There is, therefore, the challenge for this policy to embrace the diversity within men and to acknowledge that, within Irish society, there are many different ways to be a man.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Policy also needs to embrace the many paradoxes that impact upon the lives of men and their health, for example, there is now the widespread expectation in modern Ireland that men need to respond to changing roles and demands in society. However, it is known that social, cultural and practical constraints pose significant barriers for men who want to change and in terms of the choices they wish to make. In the case of fathers, for example, the complexities of balancing the notion of new fatherhood with factors such as inflexible work demands, the harsh reality of economic necessity for many men and disapproval or ridicule from other men are often overlooked.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The consultation process also stressed the need for an intersectoral approach at all levels to address men's health. By adopting a strategic approach to policy implementation, there is much potential to develop alliances and partnerships with many other sectors — transport, education, employment, environment and so forth — and to promote men's health in synergy with other policies and frameworks within and beyond the health sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Finally, the consultation process has made it clear that to adopt a coherent and strategic approach to men's health in the years ahead, it is vital that there is adequate provision for appropriate structures and resources for men's health policy at both national and regional levels. This is also important in terms of providing sustainable mechanisms to co-ordinate the work of different agencies to avoid overlap and duplication. It is also imperative that research should continue to underpin the implementation and ongoing evaluation of the policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">A great amount of preparatory work has been undertaken in advance of the publication of the men's health policy. While the national steering group has a wide range of expertise, it also now has access to specific Irish research on men's health and specific information from the national consultation process. The steering group is continuing apace to draft the men's health policy. Under its terms of reference, the steering group has agreed that both a policy containing higher order recommendations and a specific action plan with costed and time-framed actions will be developed in two separate documents. The men's health policy is scheduled for publication by the middle of this year, with the action plan to follow by the end of 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">In conclusion, while many challenges lie ahead in addressing the grave statistics on men's health, we will, on publication of a national policy by mid-year, be in a strong position for the first time to tackle these issues in a strategic way. The health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children has adopted a systematic and coherent approach to the development of the national policy for men's health that will be both evidence-based and will have consulted all relevant stakeholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">While there is unequivocal evidence for a specific focus on men's health, it should be made clear that the potential benefits of a men's health policy extend far beyond men. As the policy will demonstrate, targeting men's health can also impact in positive and specific ways on the lives of women and children and on society as a whole. It will also show that efforts to promote a healthier male workforce will inevitably lead to a more productive workforce. A gender-sensitive approach to men's health, therefore, has the potential to benefit men and, indeed, men's families and society as a whole.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_190">The facts about men's health are quite startling. On average, Irish men die six years younger than Irish women and they have the second lowest life expectancy in the European Union prior to the last enlargement. Mortality rates among men <i>vis-à-vis</i> women are particularly pronounced in the case of transport accidents, where they are three times higher, and suicide and intentional self-harm, where they are four times higher. Generally, men engage in higher levels of health-damaging and risk behaviour. Irish men, for example, drink 73% more frequently and binge drink 90% more frequently than Irish women. Irish men binge drink six times more often than their counterparts in other European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">It is well documented that, compared with women, men have limited contact with physicians, doctors and health care services. Men seem to have difficulty admitting they may have a problem and getting treatment for it. I am very encouraged by the recent policy launched by Fine Gael which is simple in that it calls for regular screening. The policy recommends that all adults over a certain age should be screened every five years for diabetes, heart disease and, in the case of men, prostate cancer and even breast cancer, which can occur in men, although not to the same extent as in women. The key aspect of the policy is prevention rather than cure.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Some time ago somebody pointed out to me that it was an oxymoron that we have a Department of Health and Children. It was suggested it should be called a department of sickness because all the Department does is react to illnesses. Senator Glynn who serves with me on the Joint Committee on Health and Children will no doubt agree that we are always chasing rather than leading in this area. It makes sense that the State should ensure citizens have regular screening in order to prevent common illnesses that if caught in time could be dealt with more quickly and cheaply, but that is not happening. Fine Gael policy suggests that people over 65 years of age should be screened every two years and the Minister should take that on board. Let us forget about focus groups carrying out more research. They are all very well, but we want more concrete solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">I visited a widow in her home over the weekend. She explained to me that when her late husband visited the doctor when he was quite ill, he told the doctor that he was fine. His wife had to tell the doctor that he was not fine and explain his problems. Men have difficulty admitting feeling ill and often leave it too late to go to a doctor.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">At the recent National Ploughing Championships a medical company carried out a random audit of farmers and other people attending the show. Many of these people were rushed off to hospital afterwards because they had not had their blood pressure checked in years and were on the verge of a heart attack. It is vital that we put a screening programme in place that is aimed at prevention, rather than leaving it too late to provide a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The Minister of State alluded to the fact that socioeconomic and educational background have a significant bearing on people's health. It is vital we continue to share the wealth of this economy. Over Christmas we heard the Government had taken in over €2.5 billion in extra taxes. Perhaps it would be wise to use that money to promote health education for men. Men could be provided with sample health check packs and encouraged to use the Internet to discreetly obtain information on their medical problems as they often have grave difficulty asking in person. The Department should consider providing a website for men's health issues where men could get proper medical advice in the privacy of their home or local library without embarrassment.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">It would be remiss of us not to refer to sudden adult death syndrome. Unfortunately, in the past number of years we have lost many key sports stars. I think of Cormac McAnallen the former Tyrone footballer who, even though he was superbly fit, collapsed and died. We await the publication of the report on sudden adult death, which seems to be taking a long time. I was assured it would be issued this month, but I have not yet heard about it. Will the Minister of State inquire about the delay in publishing the report? The Tánaiste has been briefed on it and many voluntary groups are waiting for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Many voluntary groups plan to avail of and use defibrillators in sports facilities and in the wider community, especially in communities not near a hospital. In the vital few minutes after somebody gets a heart attack, a defibrillator can save the person's life if used correctly. I urge the Minister of State to inquire about the delay in publishing the report on sudden adult death. Leading cardiologists were involved in it. Voluntary groups awaiting it are unable to progress their case for defibrillators until it is published. As far as I am aware, the report will recommend putting defibrillators in every possible location where they will be accessible to the public. This has happened abroad, but unfortunately not here so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">I was amused to read recently that single men die younger and married men live longer but that single women live longer than married women. This might lead one to believe that marriage is good for men but bad for women. I am not sure we can build anything on this. I know the Government is working on many of the recommendations in the 2004 report to which the Minister of State referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">It is vital we have an information campaign. We should move towards a men's health week like that started in America in 1994 under Bill Clinton, which would raise awareness of illnesses which affect men, such as prostate cancer. It should also provide information to the public and a dedicated website which would discreetly provide information to men who have grave difficulty admitting they have problems. Perhaps a text message service would also be beneficial for the 50% of men who do not attend a physician on a regular basis. Even when they do, some of them will not admit to medical difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">I repeat my call to the Minister to take the Fine Gael policy on board. The Government has taken on board Fine Gael policy on general practitioner-only medical cards and our policy on medical cards for those under five years of age. It is time it looked at this issue practically and provided screening every five years for adults under 65 years of age and every two years thereafter. It must focus on prevention rather than cure.</p>

        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_107">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_201">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his presentation. I thank Senator Glynn for requesting this debate. The debate is worthwhile because this is an area that has been neglected. I am not sure why this is so, but perhaps it is because men have not called strongly for debate and necessary services. Traditionally women's voices have been stronger in the this regard and we call on a regular basis for improved health services such as breast or cervical cancer screening, etc. We talk about these issues regularly. Senator Glynn is right that we should call for more services for men. We should all be treated equally. If we do not look after everybody in the community, society suffers. I agree the area has been neglected and needs to be addressed urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The Minister of State made a startling statement in his presentation. He said young Irish men are almost four times more likely to die prematurely than their female counterparts and currently have the second highest suicide rate of the 30 OECD member states. It is shocking that we are the second highest, but this comes as no surprise to us. We need to look deeply at this issue and tackle the problem of depression. Why is it that more young men are at higher risk of taking their own lives? This is a serious problem we need to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I am also concerned about obesity among young men. Whatever we say about men in this regard, it also applies to women. Obesity is certainly a problem and we need to start tackling it. We need to build a healthier nation and target people at a very young age by getting them involved in sport. We need to encourage them to continue participating in sport throughout their lives so they will remain healthy.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Reference was made to men's sexual health, which needs to be considered. It is an area of great importance because young people, both male and female, are taking very serious risks. Bearing in mind that many young people are very responsible, we should note that many young men tend to leave responsibility for contraception to women. This is not good enough. We are not just talking about preventing pregnancy but also want to ensure people are healthy and do not contract sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. It is very important that we do much more to educate young people about their sexual health so they will take responsibility for themselves and not expect others to do so for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">We have been shy when talking about and advertising sexual health. We need to do much more and I hope the Minister of State will make people feel more open in this regard in order that the subject can be discussed in schools. We need to promote sexual health widely and tell young people they must take responsibility for their sexual health and protect themselves. By doing so, they will also protect others.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">It is a well-known fact that where there is poverty, both men and women take less care of themselves. There are many reasons for this. One reason is obviously financial in that people will forego going to the doctor when money is scarce. Even if they have a medical card they tend to ignore their health until they develop a serious problem. We need to tackle this and ensure that as many people as possible get a medical card so they will go to a medical practitioner early rather than wait until their medical condition becomes serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Let me raise the issue of sudden adult death syndrome, as mentioned by Senator Browne. It is a growing problem and I have been affected by it in that a very close friend, a very fit young person, died suddenly. The syndrome usually affects very fit people. If they were not so fit, their heart problems or other conditions would be noticed earlier. I welcome any research done in this area to ensure we prevent the growing problem of sudden death among young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I welcome the programme the Minister of State is to introduce, much of which will involve an awareness campaign. I believe there was an advertisement some time ago asking men whether they had had their MOT this year. This is catchy and represents the kind of initiative we need to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Women are used to going for their annual check-up. Men should get into this frame of mind but we must tell them they should do so. They should have one at various stages of their lives. I do not want to pick out any single age group as it is important that people of every age group look after themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Prostate cancer is easily dealt with if detected early. It is important to let men know the symptoms so they will recognise them. Much of the funding should go towards awareness campaigns, be they on television, in newspapers or on posters. This is what needs to be done and I welcome the Minister of State's initiative.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_211">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. It could be said that everything comes to he who waits. We have been calling for this debate for quite some time. Having worked in the health area for a number of years, I am very much aware than men's health has not taken centre stage in the same way as women's health. There are a number of reasons for this. I am delighted to hear that if other Members are offering to contribute at the conclusion of this debate, it will be continued on another day. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">For men to reach their full health potential, there is a need for a wide range of agencies and community organisations to address the needs and support initiatives. The Health Service Executive or any other agency or group working alone will not be sufficient to effect the required changes to improve and sustain the gains in men's health that can be achieved by a multi-agency, multidisciplinary and cross-community approach. It is fair to say the subject is complex and cannot be dealt with in isolation. All facets of the health service and other support structures, be they social or otherwise, must be employed and merged to ensure the implementation of a positive policy on men's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I agree with the remarks of Senator Browne on reactionary services. When speaking in the House recently on diabetes, I said the services, including those associated with men's health, were pretty much reactionary — they are. There is a reason for this, which I will state later.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Parents should encourage their children to look after their health. Mothers especially have a pivotal role to play in this regard because, traditionally, the Irish male is the kind of individual who, in the main, does not like to admit he is cold if he is not wearing his coat on a cold day. If he puts his coat on it is seen as a sign of weakness. This is a stupid attitude. When I was a young lad and put on my coat on a cold day in the presence of a senior male, he would ask why a young lad would be feeling the cold. He would say I was not cold — this was the attitude. It is a fact that improving or conserving one's health in any shape or form was regarded as a sign of weakness. Women should encourage the men in their lives to look after their health and should encourage their male offspring to do so from an early age. It is a question of shaping attitudes now rather than reacting to them later.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Reference was made to suicide. Senator Browne will be aware that the suicide rate among young men is seven times higher than that among young women. This statistic, which is absolutely true, is frightening by any standards. It is true because Mary will go home and tell Mammy, Daddy or somebody else her problems while Johnny will not because he will regard doing so as a sign of weakness and not the manly thing to do. How stupid can one get?</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Fostering positive attitudes to one's health should be an objective of parents and they should impart to their children a consciousness of their own health. In the main, once one reaches adulthood one is responsible for one's own health. Consider the diabetes epidemic, for example. As everybody who has taken an interest in the condition, especially type 2 diabetes, will note, there are some 250,000 diabetics in the country, 90% of whom have type 2 diabetes. Another 25% are as yet undiagnosed, many of them men, although I do not know the ratio.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">We have primary responsibility for our own health but it should be pointed out that health has never been on the agenda for men. As a result, Irish men's lack of knowledge of fundamental health issues continues to be a key area of concern. For example, an ordinary man will have his car serviced but may never have visited a doctor in his life. That person could be suffering from type 2 diabetes but will not have been tested for it, nor will he have had a rectal examination, a prostate-specific antigen test or a blood pressure check. Men will service their cars but will not look after themselves, which is amazing.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">There is a need for increased education and awareness of men's health issues, which should be targeted at both boys and men. Hence, the shaping of the person by parents in the home is of pivotal importance for sons, and also for spouses, brothers and uncles. Improved information, education and awareness is the most important factor for managing health problems more effectively. Male-specific preventive health continues to lag behind, with three out of four men aged 50 or over reporting never having had a digital rectal examination despite the incidence of colorectal as well as testicular and prostate cancer. The National Cancer Forum met with Members before Christmas to give us an in-depth view of men's health issues, particularly with regard to oncology, which was worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Those men who reported having had a digital rectal examination in the past were significantly more likely to be well-educated and to be married or cohabiting. This does not suggest that education and spousal or partner support are key indicators in the preventive health-seeking behaviour of men, but they have a role. The importance of spousal or partner support is borne out by the fact that 98% of what may be termed "reluctant attenders" acknowledged going to the doctor at the behest of a woman. Partners, mothers and wives have a pivotal role to play. It would also appear that male-specific health issues are high on the list of factors that appear to cause men to be reluctant to go to their doctors in the first instance — it is not seen as the manly thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Men's health is not just a men's issue. Health problems affecting men can also have a significant impact on the welfare and qualify of life of women and children. For example, a man's drink problem has a serious adverse effect on his children and wife or partner. It affects everybody, as anyone who has had contact with Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon, Alateen or other organisations that are supportive to those with drink problems will know.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Men's health must be viewed as much more than the sum of male-specific illnesses or diseases. A narrow focus can lead to misconceptions that male health problems are limited to the prostate gland, and the subsequent mindset that if the prostate gland is okay, there is nothing else to be concerned about. That is not the case. A more rounded approach that focuses on men's quality of life, and that supports men to experience optimal social, emotional and physical health, is called for. It is acknowledged that men are more likely to take risks with their health. We need to understand why this is so and why they are more likely to engage in behaviour that damages their health rather than preventing threats to health. We also need to encourage men not to seek help for an illness in its latter stages but when symptoms are first evident. The servicing of one's car remains a good comparison.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Raising awareness of health issues among Irish men is crucial because a psyche has existed over a number of generations which must change. Sometimes it takes a crisis to act as a wake-up call to an increased health consciousness. Late presentation to health services has been implicated as a key factor in men's higher mortality rates and lower life expectancy. There is a need to confront what might be described as the traditional male gender script, which confers status on health-damaging and risk behaviours, and which infers weakness and femininity from positive health care practices. In other words, any man who looks after his health is seen as a sissy. The concept that being sick or going to the doctor somehow represents failure or personal weakness in men must be reversed if we are to make progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I will detail statistics from one health agency, which speak volumes. On average 1,160 claims were made each year between 1999 and 2004 for myocardial infarction, otherwise known as heart attack, of which some 70% were for men. Recent studies have suggested that one of the reasons why women have a lower rate of heart disease than men is partly due to the protection provided by the natural hormone oestrogen, which is produced until menopause. However, once women have reached that stage, their risk of heart disease rapidly rises to equal that of men. In 2004, 1,185 claims were made, of which 801 were for men, which is 67.6%. Of these 801 claims, 99, or 12.3%, were for men under the age of 50, with the largest number, 234, or 29%, being for men aged between 61 and 70. The volume of heart bypass procedures overall has been reducing due to the use of angioplasty surgery and all that goes with it. The agency's statistics also deal with cost issues, but we are not concerned with that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">According to national cancer registry statistics published in June 2005, based on studies carried out between 1994 and 2001, an average of 1,371 of the Irish population present with prostate cancer annually. On average, almost 520 men die from this type of cancer each year. Between 1994 and 2001, the number of prostate cancer cases rose by more than 6% per annum on average, which is a real cause of concern. Prostate cancer accounts for 12.8% of all cancer deaths in men. Almost 31% of prostate cancer patients are treated by surgery alone, with nearly 48% of the remainder receiving a combination of treatments including surgery, hormone therapy, chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Over 21% of prostate cancer patients receive no treatment, surgery or therapy for their cancer. The incidence of prostate cancer is higher in the south west than elsewhere, although this may be due to differences in diagnostic practices rather than underlying differences in incidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">On average, 1,328 people claim each year for prostate gland surgery. Of this figure, some 25%, or 332 cases, present with prostate cancer. Last year the relevant health care agency paid out more than €5.5 million for prostate gland surgery. The average cost of prostate surgery in a private hospital is approximately €5,800. The number of claims for prostate cancer surgery to date in 2005 is up 6.4% on the figure for 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">A serious situation exists which must be addressed as a matter of urgency. A multifaceted, multi-agency approach must be taken across the board. The most recent report from the national cancer registry, Cancer in Ireland 1994-2002, estimates the annual incidence of prostate cancer to have increased by between 5% and 6%. The National Cancer Forum is finalising a new national cancer strategy. The forum comprises a multidisciplinary group of oncology experts. As part of its work it has reviewed all issues connected with screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancers. The latter condition is particularly pertinent to men's health. The forum has also developed criteria against which all future screening programmes will be assessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">It is understood that the forum will decide there is insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population-based prostate screening programme. I do not agree that this issue should be reassessed when the results are available from randomised control trials being conducted internationally. Most people would agree there should be screening. The statistics on the incidence for the dates I have mentioned, and the percentage increase per annum indicate that there are enough undiscovered cases to merit this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">This position is inconsistent with the recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocates the introduction of cancer screening programmes that have demonstrated their efficacy, having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for health care resources. The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer. Appropriate treatment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer is available at all major hospitals throughout the country. Any man who is concerned about prostate cancer should do what he does with his car, namely, go for a service. In other words, he should visit his doctor.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I could continue on this subject. Men's health is of particular importance because men's health problems have an adverse effect on their families. This applies equally to men who live alone because all men have mothers, fathers, siblings and other relatives. If a man does not look after his health that has a negative effect on those close to him. I welcome the opportunity to debate this important subject. I hope I will have a further opportunity to engage in such a debate.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_230">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, and his officials to the House and thank them for contributing to this significant series of statements. I also commend Senator Glynn on his perseverance in seeking this debate. When one hears that a discussion is to take place on a strategy for men's health one can be forgiven for wondering what this is trying to achieve, what is the purpose of this discussion and what drives the need for a specific policy framework on men's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The health promotion unit, HPU, organised a series of men's health workshops around the country last year. These consultations involved engagement with all those working with men in the statutory, private and voluntary sectors and, of course, men themselves. The report that followed this consultation process opens with the statement, "A strong public policy gives legitimacy to any men's health initiatives that might be developed in the future". It is worth considering this point. Why would initiatives in an important area such as men's health require specific legitimacy?</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The answers are complex. There is disparity in health outcomes between the genders, and among men. On average, Irish men can expect to live to 73 years of age, whereas Irish women can expect to live to 78.6 years. Men die from testicular and prostate cancers although both are treatable if identified early. Heart disease is largely preventable through lifestyle changes. Men perform poorly in respect of certain lifestyle factors. They eat less fruit and vegetables than women, have a higher intake of fat, are more overweight and obese and 75% of all suicides are men, particularly young men. Deaths from road accidents are three times higher in men, especially young men. Men appear in greater numbers in mental hospitals and in prisons. Men are less likely to visit a doctor when they are ill and less likely to report symptoms of disease or illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">These problems, specific to or more prevalent in men, pose a challenge but also incentivise a strong men's health policy. They legitimise the steps taken to address these issues. The consultation process confirmed the need for existing and future policy across all sectors to be gender and equality-proofed. All policy moves should be assessed in terms of their impact on the health of men and women.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Gender difference in health promotion needs to be discussed. Where it is discussed, contributors can be accused of reinforcing stereotypes about both women and men. In general the stereotype of the carefree, or careless man, self-assured in his own invulnerability and immortality, and some sort of inverse for women are not helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">I was fascinated, however, to read of a new study, published in the journal <i>Physiology and Behaviour</i>, which confirms a common stereotype, namely, that women tend to comfort themselves with sweet-tasting foods while men prefer meat as their so-called comfort food. We need to recognise that there are differences in behaviour between the genders which can lead to different health outcomes, without fear of being accused of reinforcing unhelpful stereotypes.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Recent media reports have highlighted the differing effects the same drug can have on male versus female patients. This does not refer to a complex, prescribed drug but to aspirin. In this month's <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>, it is reported that men taking aspirin tend to have fewer heart attacks, while women have fewer strokes. No one knows why the drug acts differently on men and women, although basic physical differences are suspected. Medical professionals are talking about developing gender-specific testing and gender-specific medicine.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The health promotion unit's excellent 2004 report, Getting Inside Men's Health, to which the Minister of State has referred, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_238">The failure to recognise gender as an interactive system is fundamentally a failure to come to grips fully with the underlying causes for men's and women's health issues. The general absence of research in Ireland on gender relations and masculinities renders our understanding of the causation of men's health problems largely vague and speculative.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">We must not allow a failure to understand the importance of some gender specific public policy to compound this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The HPU consultation days also revealed disparities in health outcomes among men as an individual cohort, specifically for men affected by marginalisation. These include socioeconomic inequalities in men's health, problems of access to health and social services for minority groups of men such as Travellers and ethnic minorities and personal assistance for men with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">The HPU's 2004 report states, "the differences in men's health status and health outcomes arise in particular as a consequence of age, social class, education, employment status [and] the effects of marginalisation". I would urge that any men's health strategy would take on board the report's recommendations, including a careful choice of means to deliver information to minorities, the involvement of people from such minorities in research work, the provision of aggressive community outreach programmes, and the provision of culturally sensitive public service announcements.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Any men's health strategy that is to effectively tackle the disparities I have outlined must be cognisant of certain basic facts. As the HPU has outlined, a gender approach to health would allow for the development of gender specific policies and initiatives that would enable, in particular, more marginalised and vulnerable men and women to be offered more appropriate and effective health care. It would also encourage and facilitate men to move away from narrow and stereotypical codes of acceptable behaviour, and to develop skills that would make them more adaptive to a changing culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I am reassured by the commitments of the Tánaiste in particular, but also by the Government generally to policies that allow for the development of gender specific policies and initiatives as specified by the health promotion unit. These include the following: broader commitments on health, such as improved transparency and effectiveness of administration and funding; restructuring of administration; the National Treatment Purchase Fund; the expansion of public hospital beds; improved staffing; and extended medical card eligibility. All of these matters will play a part in delivering better health care for men as part of the general population.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">However, we must ensure that following today's commendable debate, the challenges leading to disparity regarding men's health are not only recognised in public policy, but are also adequately addressed in future policy and initiatives. The Progressive Democrats will continue to make this a key objective in policy development and implementation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_245">I rushed up here because I did not realise that I was contributing so soon, but I am a bad example of how men should look after their health. I should probably have proceeded at a more leisurely pace but I was afraid that we would have no speakers. I had not seen that Senator Feeney was present.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">When it comes to health matters, there is no doubt that men are a dreadful bunch of cowards. They try to pretend that health is not an issue or pretend not to know the appropriate vocabulary. They will always try to dismiss, hide or avoid any symptoms in all possible circumstances. I knew a young man from the Gaeltacht, whose vocabulary in English would probably not have extended to a term such as testicular cancer but, unfortunately, he died from it before he was 40. I admire a well known intercounty footballer who was afflicted with testicular cancer in his 20s and has had no problem in advertising this fact to the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">If one sits in the company of five men and mentions testicular cancer, the reactions will vary from giggles or mild obscenities to changing the subject. I am not pretending to be one bit superior but one should contrast that with how women react to discussing health issues. Women will talk with considerably less inhibition about their health and the manifestations of ill health. They will also pursue recommended methods of self examination. The prospect of self examination to deal with testicular cancer, however, would send any collection of hardened rugby players into a fit of embarrassed giggles.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">This is a serious issue and before I even talk about health services, there are many matters to discuss concerning role models. On a related issue, I bring these matters up in my own chemical engineering classes in Cork Institute of Technology when dealing with safety. There is a need to overcome the machismo culture in looking after one's health sensibly. Women working in industrial settings are much more likely to heed, respond to and take seriously less visible threats such as low level exposure to potentially hazardous chemicals or background radiation. Women will mostly follow the recommended procedures in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">My evidence for women being more safety conscious than men is specifically based on car insurance data. Despite the fact that women drive more safely, one of the classic symptoms of this machismo culture is that most men will swear that women are dreadfully dangerous drivers. It is an overwhelming male belief, although the figures prove otherwise. Insurance companies do not make these things up. They will dangle offers in front of women because they know that women are a lower risk as they take safety more seriously. I do not think this fact is universal, however, as I have discussed this subject with a few young women and I am beginning to notice a fairly masculine style of driving among some of them. Overwhelmingly, however, the evidence proves that men do not take fundamental issues of sensible, safe living, including driving, in the same way as women do.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">We should have screening programmes for testicular cancer. Most people seem to believe that a similar screening programme would be a good thing for prostate cancer, although there are serious arguments on both sides. I understand that in half such cases, prostate cancer does not spread, while in the other half it does. Nobody is quite sure why. Men who are treated for prostate cancer go through a traumatic process of radiotherapy and possibly even surgery, although in half the cases such treatment is unnecessary. There may well be unpleasant consequences including impotence and other matters that deeply affect the male psyche and subconscious.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">There is an overwhelming case for a testicular cancer screening programme. The uptake figures for the BreastCheck programme do not reach 100%, but if an equivalent screening service were offered for testicular cancer to every man aged between 15 and 35 or 40, I predict the uptake would not be half that for BreastCheck because of the incredible issue of male machismo. We know, for example, that men visit doctors far less than women. Men try to pretend that is because women are all hypochondriacs, but it is an easier excuse than saying that men are afraid to go to a doctor for a check-up if something is wrong. How many men have been warned that they have high blood pressure, yet ignore the issue? Women, on the other hand, will conscientiously and in an organised fashion take whatever medication is prescribed for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">If one drives around any city and watches people out walking as the evenings grow longer, some 80% of walkers on any given evening are women. Men are in a tiny minority of walkers, even though walking is the simplest form of exercise and the least likely to do any damage if one is unfit. Overwhelmingly, however, one finds that most of those walking and taking other forms of exercise are women. In addition, most of those attending yoga classes and keep fit programmes are women. That is true although until recently field sports were predominantly played by men. I know that the situation has spectacularly and dramatically changed with the spread of women's football in particular. However, until recently field sports were predominantly a male preoccupation. Outside the competitive machismo of such sports, when it comes to the basic idea of looking after their own health, men have been fairly useless. Let us not even mention alcohol, smoking and other things that are not gender-specific.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Having said that, we must start by talking about such things to young men before they leave school. We must get them to begin to discuss their health. I do not want us to turn them into a generation of hypochondriacs. However, I believe that there is a sensible balance. The first thing is to get young men, before they leave secondary school, to be aware of their health and overcome inhibitions regarding self-examination, and visiting doctors regularly. We must inform them of the undoubted fact that, whatever is wrong with one, attending a doctor will not make it any worse. If it is anything serious, doing so gives one a very good chance of something being done about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I have no evidence, but I am convinced that a great number of men who die from various cancers do so as much because they are late, slow or reluctant in finding out what is wrong and getting anything done about it, so that matters progress too far. I have always believed that women, while there are obviously exceptions, are far less inhibited.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">The first thing is to introduce young men to the vocabulary and the idea that there is nothing redolent of a tough guy or macho man in ignoring one's health. It is a strange and contradictory belief that ignoring one's health somehow shows that one is tougher than those who look after themselves; I hope that it is changing. Once we have done that and, one hopes, created a demand for basic services, we must of course introduce effective forms of screening for those cancers that most afflict men, just as we have begun the process with forms specific to women.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">It is not just about cancer, and once we have done that we must examine what I believe is a problem, namely, the fact that we have no culture of exercise or fitness among men once they move beyond the age at which they participate in competitive sports. I do not know whether there is still a serious fitness culture or serious opportunities for men, particularly for those not as well-off as most of us. If one has a limited income, what does one do for exercise once one has moved beyond hurling, football, soccer or rugby? One can walk, but apparently most men do not. One can swim, but our municipal swimming pools are limited in number, expensive and in many cases not much encouragement is given. We must discuss how we can get men into a pattern of healthy living.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">There is no point in our shooting off into high-level puritanism and telling people that they must all stop drinking. We should tell them all to stop smoking, however. A man is prepared to fool himself by saying, for example, that he smokes 60 a day as his father did from 16 until his death at 96. That proves nothing other than that the father died at 96. There is a need too for us to confront the culture of binge drinking. It is a predominantly but, unfortunately, no longer exclusively, male issue. There are genuine health questions not appropriate to this debate concerning how we deal with those who end up in hospital because of self-inflicted damage caused by binge drinking. However, that is not a matter for today.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Once we have established a culture whereby men discuss their health, many of the other issues will remedy themselves. If I am ever asked about men's health, I return to the basic truth that they are cowards. As far as possible, they want to duck the issues. They run away and turn their backs on them to avoid them. They are also extraordinarily prudish regarding such basic things as self-examination. One need only listen to an all-male conversation to realise that most men would not in a million years conduct the sort of routine self-examination that a reasonably health-conscious woman will carry out. We must change that culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">Thereafter, we can move on to service provision. However, until we get men to begin to take their health seriously, we could provide all the services in the world without effect. If we announced tomorrow that we would have a nationwide testicular cancer screening service, we would have a take-up of perhaps no more than 25%.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GeraldineFeeney" eId="spk_111">
          <from>Ms Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I am delighted at today's opportunity to speak on men's health. I always enjoy listening to Senator Ryan, and I smiled at his opening remarks when he spoke of men being a big bunch of cowards pretending that nothing is wrong. It is not only men who have created that state of affairs. Women like men to be cowards, since they like to mother, mind and nurse them, pretending that women know all there is to know about health. They will always keep men as little boys.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">There is also the attitude that "big boys don't cry". If a man complains of feeling unwell, women, myself included, are a little impatient. We think that they should get on with it, since they are always moaning and groaning. I believe what Senator Ryan is saying. We need to change the mindset. Teenage girls will start talking about having a smear test from the age of 18 or 20. That is when they would start attending for annual or biannual tests. Boys would never think that they should do anything of that kind. Self-examination and so on would be thrown out. It is not something for boys or men to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I made a telephone call this morning and was very interested to hear from a GP friend in a very busy practice in Tallaght that he had conducted a survey of 100 men. It took him four years to carry out. They picked 100 men at random and asked them to take part in the survey. They were brought in for regular health check-ups. They interviewed the small minority that did not take up the call to come in, asking them why. The answer given constantly was that they did not think that the GP would be interested in knowing about their health or that there was any kind of partnership whereby the GP might wish to know about their health. The person conducting the survey found that those men were terribly lonely. Once they got talking to that person, however, they wanted to tell all regarding their health, problems and worries. They were extremely lonely men.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The point has been made time and again about the dangers of alcohol and cigarettes, and we cannot bring that home clearly enough. Alcohol is a drug that destroys young men's lives. It is affordable and easily accessible, and it does not matter if a young man is drinking, since he is simply seen as macho, which is acceptable. It does not matter if a middle-aged man does it, and he may be even more at risk. On their way home from work they will stop off and meet friends for a few drinks. They probably eat late at night. That is a most unhealthy lifestyle, particularly now that our work environment is changing. We are working fewer hours. We do not work from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. Monday to Friday. Flexi-time is available. People have a different lifestyle.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">While making notes on the way men's health is different from that of women, the area of networking came to mind. Women network so easily, as Senator Ryan and others said. A woman will have lunch with a friend and talk about the lovely pair of shoes she saw in Carl Scarpa. She might say, "I'm thinking of buying them but they are a little high and the old back is acting up. I'm suffering some pain. I might go to the doctor because it has been bothering me for a while. It could be my kidneys but it could be my uterus". It is easy for women to talk about issues like that. What starts off as something trivial will suddenly become very intense and personal. Women trust women when it comes to telling them the most intimate details about their own health.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Sadly, men lack that type of relationship with other men. People will ask someone whether they went for counselling. Women do not need counsellors because we talk to other women. Women listen to women. Men are probably more inclined to need the help of psychologists and counsellors because they do not open up enough with women or men they know. There is nothing wrong with that. I was sad to hear a speaker say earlier that Johnny was stupid because he would not tell his mother that he was feeling unwell. It is nothing to do with stupidity. It is to do with the mindset and the way boys have been reared.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I was interested to hear that men view themselves mechanically when it comes to their health. That is true. Other speakers said that men will take the car for the MOT and make sure their car is okay but their own engine could be falling out, so to speak, and they would not bother going to see a doctor. Senator Ryan talked about the macho element in men, that men are faster drivers and not careful drivers like women. I have been a passenger many times in a man's car and he will shout at the woman driving the car in front of him. I shout at them as well but he will say, "I bet it is a woman driving that car". I am always glad to say, when I look at the other driver as we pass by, "You are wrong. It is being driven by a man". Men are all go. Things do not move quickly enough for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">With regard to men not going to see their general practitioner as an interested party who will listen to their health problems, and that came from a GP, that attitude must change. Perhaps, through the Health Service Executive, we could encourage GPs to get the message across, whether by way of a notice in their waiting rooms or some other way, that they are interested in talking and listening to men.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Men need less emotional support than women, but that is not to say they do not need emotional support. They do, but men believe they are not getting that from their GP. If they were to go to their GP, however, and talk about their problems they would probably find that would change.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Screening is very important. Last week, we had a meeting with the diabetes society and some of the associated medics who treat diabetics. They were talking about treating 100 patients with blindness brought on by diabetes, which cost the State €250 million. For that €250 million they could have screened many more than 100 people and prevented blindness. That is such a shame. I realise the Minister cannot provide funding to screen for every condition but it should be considered for the type of conditions we could screen for at a low cost and thereby prevent terrible effects like blindness.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I was interested to read lately about a survey carried out in County Mayo, which I tried to find but could not. The results of the survey showed that there is more obesity in pre-school children than in children in primary school. That is a startling fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Men are equally as interested in their health as women and if they are given good news they will build on that. Some of my men friends will tell me that they went to the doctor and got the all-clear in terms of heart rate, blood pressure and so on and they are delighted with themselves. With regard to the negative effects, some television advertisements for cars, IT and so on portray younger men as being a bit silly. There is one advertisement — I think it is for a Renault car — in which the man is made out to be a fool. That type of stereotyping of young males is wrong because they are very impressionable. There is much more I wanted to say but I will conclude as we are running out of time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_112">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_272">I welcome the Minister of State and his adviser to the House. I was glad to have heard the concluding remarks of what my colleague, Senator Feeney. They were extremely interesting and helpful. I am also glad I had an opportunity to glance through the Minister of State's speech. I apologise for not being here earlier to hear all the debate but I was detained elsewhere on a matter concerning the CIA rendition flights through Shannon Airport, which is a matter equally serious to that of the question of men's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">As men, and I loosely describe myself as such, we are simply following in the wake of women. Women were alerted to the question of gender based illness much earlier than men and they were a lot wiser. They were also rather humorous about it. I remember Germaine Greer talking about the differences between the approach to health of men and women and suggesting that if men got a headache they got their agonised wife to rush them to hospital whereas with women, as she described it wonderfully, the dangly bits would have to fall off, shrivel or disappear before anybody paid them the slightest attention. Thanks to activists such as Germaine Greer and so on, that picture has radically changed and we now have a situation where the entire community is aware of the specific vulnerability of women to cervical cancer, breast cancer and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Men are unlikely to suffer from cervical cancer but a small proportion of men suffer from breast cancer. I only discovered that recently when somebody I know reasonably well was taken to hospital seriously ill with breast cancer. I understand it is a 1% figure but the problem is very real for that 1% of people. This man found a lump on his chest and thought it was a big joke but he went into hospital and found that it was an early manifestation of a malignant tumour. Luckily, he was caught in time and successfully treated but he had to have the breast removed. It is obviously not such an awkward thing for a man as for a woman because the male breast is not as significant a part of physical anatomical attraction as it is for a woman but it is a very serious illness, and it came as a surprise to me to learn that it happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Senator Feeney was very gracious towards men. Most people, but not everybody, are drips when it comes to their own health because they are shy or ashamed to take their clothes off in front of the doctor, and God help us if it is a woman doctor. To allow these intimate little bits to be seen and examined, it is almost as if, in the words of the old Catholic theology, they were taking pleasure in it, which I seriously doubt. There is a reluctance or shyness, which is a culturally induced phenomenon, and for that reason I welcome what the Minister of State said about a health awareness programme and getting people into a condition of mind where they are prepared to recognise symptoms, examine themselves and take care. I speak from personal experience because I have a precancerous prostate condition. I receive medical check-ups every year.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_289">That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p eId="para_290">—develop and extend the registered employment agreements model which gives binding status to agreements reached at sectoral and employment level;</p>
          <p eId="para_291">—devote increased resources to the labour inspectorate with more effective enforcement and prosecution of offences;</p>
          <p eId="para_292">—ensure enforcement and Revenue inspection of the sub-contractor and agency worker issue in the construction sector;</p>
          <p eId="para_293">—ensure that contractors working for local authorities and other public bodies meet minimum labour standards, in order to prevent a repeat of the Gama situation;</p>
          <p eId="para_294">—confirm the right of self-employed persons who work under contracts "personally to execute any work or labour" to join trade unions and engage in collective bargaining;</p>
          <p eId="para_295">—amend existing equality legislation to prevent any worker being discriminated against on the grounds of membership of a trade union;</p>
          <p eId="para_296">—support the temporary workers agency directive;</p>
          <p eId="para_297">—extend the equality legislation to cover people in domestic service;</p>
          <p eId="para_298">—advocate and support significant change to the services directive, in particular the "country of origin" principle;</p>
          <p eId="para_299">—reform the existing work permit system so that it becomes a green card system which does not bind workers to a particular job; and</p>
          <p eId="para_300">—gather better data on labour market conditions in order to accurately measure the extent of displacement and wage degradation.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Earlier this week, the Labour Party produced a long and detailed set of proposals entitled A Fair Place to Work and Live. It produced the document in response to a combination of anecdotal and almost universal evidence that problems have developed at individual level and may be developing on a larger scale. We know that the combined enforcement services of the State failed to defend the Gama workers from appalling practices. We discovered that the powers of the Minister to investigate the abuse of workers, such as that found in the Gama case, were quite limited and that the report on Gama cannot be published. We naively assumed that supplementary legislation would be introduced fairly promptly to ensure that a report in respect of a similar case in the future could be published so that we would know what was happening. We still do not know the full details of what happened to Gama workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Those who have highlighted anecdotal evidence would do well to remember that while everybody accepts that Gama workers were treated abysmally, the evidence for such abuses is still only anecdotal. We know the anecdotes are true but we do not have any verifiable public document. The absence of any vigorous pursuit of amending legislation to ensure that if the Department carries out an inspection and investigation in the future, the resulting report can be made public, shows the lack of enthusiasm in this area. Much the same scenario occurred in the case of a group of Polish workers who complained to their union that they were being paid €2 per hour. Six months later, the investigation still had not commenced because the inspectorate was overburdened.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Other issues have arisen, such as the extraordinary fact that a country with a booming economy and booming Government revenue does not have booming income tax receipts. A senior official in the Department of Finance, which is not renowned as a vigorous champion of workers' rights, stated that this could be due to the fact that a large number of the approximately 200,000 new jobs which have been created are low paid and, consequently, do not yield much income tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I do not wish to price this country's economy out of world markets and I do not want this country to become like the US with extraordinarily well-off people. In the UK, 16% of its income is paid to the top 1% of income earners. We perform worse than the UK on the world indices of inequality so one could estimate that approximately 20% of all the income in this State is paid — I will not use the term "earned"— to the top 1% of the employed population.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">We then witnessed the extraordinary situation in Irish Ferries. The ranks of big business in the person of the chief economist of the Bank of Ireland rallied enthusiastically to the cause of a fellow employer until they discovered that Irish public opinion, to use that wonderful phrase, had a belief that there was a threshold of decency beyond which we would not pass. Suddenly, we witnessed the spectacle of the country's largest single bank in magnificent and glorious retreat from a position which had been uttered with great enthusiasm by its chief economist on "Questions and Answers". The reason for this retreat was that the bank was in danger of upsetting its customers who did not want to live in an exploitative economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The minimum wage is a very good measure but it is not a guarantee against exploitative employers. It only guarantees against an excessive degree of exploitation. Perhaps the best way to describe it is as a starting wage but it ought not to be the wage on which anyone is expected to live indefinitely. If one was to ask a first year economics student in any third level institution to write an essay on the effect on wages at the lower end of the wage spectrum of the taking of possibly 100,000 to 150,000 jobs — between 5% and 10% of the labour force — by people with no social welfare rights, he or she would reply that such a development would drive down wages at the lower end of the economy. This would occur because these people lack the basic right to negotiate from a position of any strength. It is no good talking about minimum wages because these people are not in a position to negotiate seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">One case with which I am familiar involves a young man from outside the EU who asked why he was not paid double time on St. Patrick's Day. I will be careful in what I say because the case is supposedly due to be heard by a rights commissioner. The young man's employer, who is well known in the catering business in Ireland, told him that this right was reserved for Irish workers because it is an Irish public holiday. The young man then moved to Spain but was due to appear before the rights commissioner. At the last minute the employer sought and was awarded an adjournment, which meant the young man had to travel back to Spain, and probably will not return.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I am concerned about that young person and that the case is documented. A proactive approach to defending the rights of people in our new economy would have immediately begun an investigation. One cannot prove this but perhaps 150,000 or 160,000 new jobs yielded only a marginal increase in employment. If one looks at the CSO figures one sees that for a significant period of 2004 and 2005 the average weekly earnings in the accommodation and catering business declined. This is the longest period of decline on the CSO website. It has probably gone up again now. One should look at the extraordinary explosion of self-employment in the building industry. At a time when we were told that there was a booming building industry we have fewer people employed in the industry and thousands of self-employed people.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">In a rapidly changing economy groups of people can be left behind, exploited and be unaware of their rights. Groups of people who have come to this country and who are welcome here, who have limited English, who come from cultures where the state has been seen for much of their young lives as an oppressor from whom one expects nothing but hostility, oppression and negativity are offered perhaps twice what they would have earned at home but which is barely the minimum wage here. What happens when an unscrupulous employer finds a way to use that combination of naivety, limited English and past experience to use these people instead of Irish workers who know their rights and who may be unionised? One ends up with a slow, step-by-step displacement.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I received a phone call this afternoon about two separate contractors in the Cork region who have set up agencies in two eastern European countries to recruit people there without advertising the jobs locally. If we have genuine vacancies at the current rate for a job in any area we welcome people here. However, we want to ensure we do not build our prosperity on a combination of the exploitation of our new arrivals and the consequential exploitation of Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Although this motion comprises a list of statements to which no reasonable person could object, the Government amendment omits and fails to mention many of them. Why does the Government not accept our suggestion that it should gather better data on labour market conditions? It knows if one begins to look at what happens one will move from our anecdotes and patchy information to a comprehensive model that will clearly indicate that, to the benefit of unscrupulous employers, Irish workers are in danger of being replaced by other workers who will be easier to exploit, manipulate and deceive. It is a pity, in the spirit of partnership, that the Government felt the need to amend a mild and positive motion such as this and remove some of the obvious suggestions such as the assembly of information.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_312">I am happy to second the motion. This issue has emerged quickly considering it is only approximately seven months since the European Union expanded on 1 May 2004. In that period of time we have experienced a rapid level of social change of which the arrival of many thousands of workers from the new accession states is only one element. It is urgent that the impact on wage rates and the labour force of the arrival and exploitation of such large numbers of new workers is addressed. This motion is an attempt to bring this matter higher on the Government's agenda. It will be on the agenda for the partnership talks and that is welcome but it must be managed in that context. Considering how quickly this issue has developed it is important that the Government respond quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Our motion proposes a framework of responses which is reasonable, possible and comprises positive, practical ways the Government can act on this issue. If the Government does not act there will be consequences. There may already be consequences of which we are not aware. The impact on the fabric of our society of an outbreak of xenophobia or a serious level of negativity towards immigrant workers would be very serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Let us look at the context of this debate. I quote from Deputy Rabbitte in the Labour Party policy document published this week:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_315">There are two principal views in this debate and they are present right across the EU. One view — with which our Government has been associated — is that employers should have free access to an unlimited supply of cheap labour ... The other view is that we must defend the European social model and social protection. Labour takes the latter position.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">That is the context for our policy and our motion. We support a European social model and social protection. Workers coming from poorer nations, new members of the European Union deserve to be protected. There is increasing evidence that they are not being protected but exploited and the impact of that exploitation is on already low-paid workers and is driving down the wage rates in a number of industries, particularly in construction.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Last November SIPTU president Jack O'Connor cited CSO figures to confirm the race to the bottom, which refers to the debate around the degradation of wages and its impact in the private sector. He cited the latest comparative earnings statistics published by the CSO in November and said they show that the absolute minimum Sustaining Progress increases for the 12 months to June 2005 should have yielded at the very least a 4% increase in average earnings in the private sector. This was at the point of the expansion of the European Union. By last November, evidence was published showing that the rate of earnings increase in the private sector was not as high as it should have been. Instead, average earnings in business services including transport had only increased by 3.3%, while earnings increased by only 2.7% in the retail trade. Ominously, average earnings for all industrial workers had only increased by 2.4%, lower than what would have been expected, given the framework of Sustaining Progress and the pay increase contained therein. That would certainly appear to be more evidence of the exploitation of foreign workers. The impact of this is very serious for communities all over the country. The whole reaction to the Irish Ferries dispute is that Irish people do not support the Government's approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The Labour Party supported the issue of open access to Ireland under the Nice treaty, because we support the free movement of people. On the surface, it looks like the best way forward for everyone, but it will only work if exploitation does not occur. Against the background of evidence of exploitation, the Government must act as soon as possible. What we are saying now does not undermine our position of support during the Nice treaty debate, but it brings forward a framework to deal with a situation which is evolving as we speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">In July 2005, I went around a town in north Tipperary knocking on doors. I entered a three year old estate of approximately 60 houses, of which 48 were on the register. It was a Friday evening and quite a significant number of people were at home. Of the 48 houses on the register, only 12 of the registered inhabitants still lived on the estate, which I thought was quite a high figure. The people who had replaced them were all from eastern Europe. Between 30 and 34 of those houses were occupied by people from eastern Europe, which is fine. However, I did some research on it afterwards and discovered that around 15% to 20% of the population of the town now come from eastern Europe. That has serious implications for education resources and for the resources of that town. This issue is not being examined or planned and I suggest it urgently needs to be addressed.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_329">(1) the commitment of the Government to address, in a partnership context, concerns about the maintenance and protection of employment standards in the Irish labour market including, in particular:</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_333">health and safety; part-time and fixed-term workers; national minimum wage levels; substantial increases in redundancy entitlements and improvements for carers and parents; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_334">(3) the Government reaffirms its commitment to the social partnership model as the most appropriate mechanism for advancing these issues in the interest of both employees and employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The Minister of State must be pleased that the Labour Party put down this motion because since his appointment, he has addressed all of the issues involved in the motion. He can point out the positive contributions that he and his Department have made since his appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Each year, millions of men and women leave their homes and cross national borders in search of greater human security for themselves and their families. Most are motivated to migrate by the quest for higher wages and better opportunities, but some are forced to do so because of famine, natural disasters, violent conflict or persecution. Historically, immigration has been economically beneficial to host countries as well as to the migrants themselves. Many of the fears surrounding the impact of immigration on developed economies are unfounded or exaggerated. For example, there is no evidence that immigration significantly reduces wages or pushes up unemployment. Immigration is one of the most important challenges currently facing Ireland and the other member states of the European Union. As a society, it is imperative that we deal with the issues posed by immigration in a positive, coherent and humane way.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Immigration is a relatively new phenomenon in Ireland. We have changed radically from the mid-1990s onwards from a country of emigration to a receiving country, a major achievement by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government. The experience of Irish emigrants in many different countries has often been one of discrimination and hardship. Deputy Rabbitte, leader of the Labour Party, is trying to exploit this issue for political purposes.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_345">I certainly will do so, but I must make the point that many of the views being expressed by the Labour Party do not have our support on this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The experience of Irish emigrants exhorts us as a nation to treat immigrants humanely and with respect. We have an opportunity to manage the relatively new phenomenon of immigration in a positive, non-discriminatory, person-centred manner that will benefit both immigrants and Irish society. We must recognize fully at a legal level the rights of migrant workers and the important contribution that such workers make to the European and Irish economy. The Employment Permits Bill 2005 is a sophisticated response to the issue of migration. In line with the increase in employment, the labour force, that is, employed and unemployed, rose very rapidly and now exceeds 2 million for the first time since the foundation of the State, which is an enormous achievement by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">As well as the natural increase of 18,000, the labour force was augmented by net inward migration of 36,000 and a 40,000 increase in participation. The latter was due in particular to greater participation of women aged 45 or older in the workforce. Non-nationals now make up 8% of the Irish labour force — equivalent to one of the highest percentages in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Attracting and integrating immigrants will be an important aspect of labour market policy over the coming years. Immigrants will be needed both to supplement domestic sources of labour supply — the CSO has estimated a need for up to 40,000 immigrants per annum — and to help fill particular areas of skill shortage.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">However, it is important that policy makers and stakeholders do not see immigration as an easy alternative to trying to meet Ireland's future skill needs from domestic sources. Many issues have arisen as regards the Gama workers and Irish Ferries. Those issues are being looked at and will be dealt with by the Government. I have much more to say on this particular issue. I hope there will be another opportunity for returning to it, when we will be asking the Government to outline matters in more detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Our Members in the House are very proud of the Government's achievements. As regards work permits, green cards, etc., I fully support the right of people to work in the economy while not being tied to any employer. It is very important that this should be allowed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_353">I also welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House and I thank the Labour Party for bringing this motion to the floor of the Seanad. It gives the House a chance to bring up many of the issues that are raised in the Labour Party document, entitled A Fair Place to Work and Live, and many other issues which have been the talk of the nation for some years.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Nobody could have failed to detect the palpable sense of dismay and anger over recent events at Irish Ferries and Gama. Before getting into the detail of what the Labour Party is proposing, I want to comment on these disgraceful developments. As regards Irish Ferries, the fact that a former State company would resort to such Dickensian tactics in order to cut costs without the slightest concern for the workers whose livelihoods it was destroying, is nothing short of scandalous. Whatever captain of industry decided that this was a good idea should be ashamed of himself or herself. The developments in Irish Ferries are significant not just because of those whom they directly affect. Every employee in the country is looking at Irish Ferries and reflecting that this could be him or her. We have a duty in this House to ensure this does not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">In late 1999 Irish Ferries announced that it was to spend €17 million on purchasing the ship, <i>M.V. Normandy</i>. It is extraordinary that only five years after such an enormous capital outlay it tried to take the by now infamous remedial action. The House should know that in May 2005 it became known that Irish Ferries was one of the main beneficiaries of the so-called tonnage tax scheme. It saved an estimated €3 million in tax payments in 2003, the first year of the scheme’s operation. The House should also know that it was made clear at that time that without the tax break jobs would be lost. The House is well aware of the industrial relations pariah that Irish Ferries became when it decided that it was perfectly acceptable to pay a Filipino worker just one euro an hour to work on one of its ships. All of this came from a company that apparently buys into social partnership, a project that has served both Irish Ferries and the nation well.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Similarly, revelations regarding foreign workers in Gama Construction are shameful. I sincerely hope that the labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment investigates, prosecutes and punishes those responsible for any impropriety, exploitation and fraud that may have taken place. However, if any good is to come from this development, perhaps we may finally see the emergence of a proper rational debate on immigration and thought-out Government policy on the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The findings of last week's TNS-MRBI opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i>, where a majority of voters indicated their support for the reintroduction of work permits for eastern European workers, is hardly surprising. However, we must look beyond this to what the country really needs. Fine Gael believes the country should be upfront and honest about the need for immigration, the benefits it can bring and the repercussions of not welcoming inward migration. It is a simple fact that Ireland will need to import the skills needed to ensure that we remain a world-class player.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">The economy has the potential to post cumulative growth of 45% between now and 2016, with the performance to be fuelled by immigration, according to Goodbody Stockbrokers. Growth of this magnitude would see Ireland expanding at more than twice the rate of the average eurozone economy over the next decade. Goodbody went so far as to say that for this growth to be achieved, inward migration must play a vitally important role. Against that background we have the absurd farce of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform deporting and then bringing back leaving certificate students and construction companies paying migrant workers a euro an hour to build this country, quite literally.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">As a public representative, I am tired of this phoney debate. I am tired of the constant portrayal of immigration as a problem. It may be politically astute to give the nod to the baser instincts of some of the electorate, but it is foolish to think that without a flow of migrant labour to staff the service and construction industries the economy can survive. I ask those who complain that there are too many foreigners working here to ask themselves honestly who will staff our hospitals and our restaurants. How will our tourism industry operate without the necessary staff? How will our service industries survive? Where will we get builders and construction workers or computer programmers? All of these areas — and more — suffer from staff shortages, which would be much worse were we to close the door on foreign workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">My party shares the concern that the motion expresses as regards the EU services directive. Fine Gael fully supports the free movement of goods, services and labour within the European Union. We are the most pro-European party in the Oireachtas, and view the EU as a force for good in this country and beyond. It has been the EU, in many instances, that has dragged Ireland kicking and screaming into the 21st century on everything from the rights of women to worker protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">However, we cannot agree with the services directive in its current form. The European People's Party, EPP, of which we are part, would not support the country of origin principle and it cannot be implemented without the EPP's approval. There is much to be welcomed in the directive. Moves to give consumers greater choice, to improve efficiency, promote competition and widen markets are all very good. What is not good, however, is the suggestion that someone from Poland should be exploited in this country at a wage rate that is significantly below the minimum rate of pay for Irish workers. The repercussions of such a disastrous policy would be felt not merely in an industrial context — although it would obviously have industrial ramifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Without going over the top, we risk creating a whole new underclass of underpaid and undervalued foreign workers if we go down this road. It is not an enormous step for our growing immigrant population to become disillusioned with this country. Given a mixture of poverty, disillusionment and a lack of any sense of participation in our society, ghettoisation, cultural separation and even crime can become rife. Ireland is well placed to avoid the mistakes of the United States, Britain and France in this area. We can avoid ethnic ghettos and a two or three-tier society. However, we can only avoid these pitfalls if we enshrine equality as a basic tenet of our approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">On other points raised by the motion, I fully support the call to properly resource the labour inspectorate and collect better data on the issue. This and many other areas of Irish life suffer from a data deficit that exacerbates the problems. We also fully support the green card system referred to.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Since the publication of the Employment Permits Bill, the Minister has referred to green cards in an effort to suggest his Department has come up with a comprehensive and compassionate answer to the problems faced by the migrant workers who make such a contribution to the economy. The last time I checked, Irish citizens had the right to quit any job they liked and look for another one. However, the Bill does not give immigrants the complete freedom to do that because it does not give the employee rights over his or her employment status. While the Bill makes it easier for migrant labour to move jobs, I am at a loss to know why the Minister did not go all the way and grant the green card to the employee and not the employer. We support the Labour Party motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGerardHanafin" eId="spk_144">
          <from>Mr. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_365">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and second the amendment. The Government has a proud record. Some of the difficulties it has faced had not been experienced by previous Governments, such as dealing with vast numbers of immigrants. This is borne out by the fact that the Opposition constantly berates us for not having the numbers necessary to enforce standards. This issue was raised within social partnership and at the time the numbers were not regarded as a difficulty. This Government is managing growth very well despite what the Opposition may say.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I acknowledge there have been difficulties but nobody had the Government's permission to behave in such a way. The actions taken by Gama and Irish Ferries were unacceptable. The Government wants only the highest and best standards of employment for workers. There is no distinction in employment rights legislation between Irish and migrant workers. For the avoidance of doubt, section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to workers posted to work in Ireland, in line with Directive 96/71/EC of 16 December 1996 of the European Parliament and Council. This directive relates to the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services and applies also to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. All employee legislation applies to migrant workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The general approach adopted by the labour inspectorate to employment rights enforcement is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including payment of any arrears due to employees. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and seek redress for the individual or individuals concerned and a prosecution is initiated if appropriate. Successful prosecution can be dependent on adequate support from witnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Following the Minister's announcement on 12 April 2005, 31 inspector posts have now been sanctioned for the labour inspectorate, representing a doubling of the inspectorate in the past 12 months. This is indicative of a determination to ensure compliance with employment rights legislation. Following a recent selection process the inspectorate now has its full complement of 31 inspectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">When the full complement of officers is fully operational they will concentrate on those employment sectors that have traditionally required considerable attention from the inspectorate, for instance, the service sectors such as hospitality and cleaning and agricultural work which are covered by employment regulation orders. It is notable that many migrant workers are currently employed in these sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Work has been progressing with regard to the discussion document prepared in connection with the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate. The discussion document covers all the issues that impact on the operation of the inspectorate, ranging from the legislative framework to the operational aspects and staff development. The social partners, together with representatives from the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance, are members of the employment rights compliance group, ERCG, which is considering the discussion document. It is anticipated that the ERCG will conclude its business this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The Government is committed to having the minimum wage exempt from tax but it is also committed to sustaining economic growth and keeping the public finances in a healthy condition. Budget 2006 removed the minimum wage from the income tax net. The Government introduced the minimum wage to protect low-paid workers and over the past eight budgets it has removed a record number of 465,000 workers entirely from the tax net. Ireland has one of the highest minimum wage rates in the European Union. Since its introduction in April 2000, the minimum wage has increased by almost 37%, taking account of the latest increase, and this is well ahead of inflation. When the statutory minimum wage came into effect in 2000, less than 64% of the annualised figure of €11,330, or £8,923, was exempt from taxation. In the budget of 2002, 90% of the minimum wage became exempt from tax and in budgets 2003 and 2004 this position was maintained even though the minimum wage was increased in October 2002 and February 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The current entry point to income tax is €14,240 per annum for a single person aged under 65 years. It is estimated that approximately 37,000 income earners will be in an income range which would bring them into the tax net if their annual earnings fully reflected the increase in the national minimum wage. However, this group will, of necessity, include part-time workers earning more than the minimum hourly wage and certain pensioners whose earnings are in the equivalent range. These 37,000 people should therefore be regarded as the upper band for any estimate of the number who may ultimately come into the tax net on a full year basis as a result of the minimum wage increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The Government has a fine record in maintaining employment rights. Where the labour inspectorate has found that people have been mistreated, this mistreatment was not done in our name. This country is still Ireland of the welcomes.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_374">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. As my Labour Party colleagues have stated, the Labour Party recently launched a document entitled, A Fair Place to Work and Live. It deals with the issues raised by this motion. I wish to highlight some of the proposals made in this document. The first proposal relates to the issue of the standards that should be applied and complied with when companies are employed by the State and local authorities. Senator Hanafin referred to the Gama workers and the revelations about their conditions of work and the exploitation to which they were subjected by the company while they were working on contracts for the State and local authorities, including my own local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Gama was contracted by South Dublin County Council to build council houses. As a local public representative I was shocked on learning of the conditions which these workers experienced with regard to their pay and daily living conditions. We must learn from this and ensure it does not happen in the future. The issue has been raised by public representatives and the local authority. Councillors from all sides of the political divide were appalled at the conditions and wanted to ensure this did not happen again. The Government needs to take action, if necessary through legislation, to ensure that the State has the right to insist that contractors working in the public sector are in compliance with basic standards of behaviour, including their treatment of their staff. The Government must introduce the legislation required to provide for this. Perhaps the Minister will comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The public sector, of all sectors, must ensure there are proper conditions. The public sector looks after its own employees, and rights and basic standards have been fought for and secured over the years. However, there is now a system where the State and local authorities can have people working on their projects who do not have the basic rights we have come to expect. What is the Minister's response to this issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Second, the Labour Party proposes the reform of the existing work permit system to provide for a green card system which will not bind workers to a particular employer. This is long-standing Labour Party policy. It is a key part of the policy document issued by the then Labour Party spokesperson on justice, Deputy Howlin, entitled Ending the Chaos, which outlined Labour Party immigration policy. I have put forward this policy many times in this House. We must have a comprehensive immigration policy that is based on a green card system. It would be a positive system.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The Labour Party supports immigration controls. They are necessary for many different reasons. A country must have an immigration and emigration system. One of the reasons it is needed is so people can know where they stand. It will also prevent the racism that results from people having fears about the immigration system and being misinformed. There must be a comprehensive system under which everybody will know their position. I have argued previously in the House that our system is a negative one. People who come to this country for economic reasons are badly treated, unless they arrive under the work permit system. We need a system under which they can apply for a green card. People from many different countries should be allowed to apply for these cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The work permit system bonds employees to an employer. Although the Government has introduced reforms in that regard, it has not gone far enough. The permit still relates to a specific employer and a specific job. There has been a change in the application process but it is still based on a restrictive system. A restrictive system such as ours encourages exploitation. If the employee is not happy in a job, he or she does not have the freedom to seek another job. The system is very restrictive in that regard. A green card system similar to that in the United States would be better. It could be applied on the basis of monitoring the country's labour needs from year to year and adjusting the system accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The United States has a strict immigration system but it is much more positive than ours. It does not criminalise immigrants in the same way our system does and it does not bond immigrants to employers. Unlike Ireland, it also grants citizenship to people on the basis of being born in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">I will now refer to an issue raised in the Dáil by my colleague, Deputy Broughan. It relates to displacement and the position of people who were previously employees and who have — subject to their own agreement, although they felt they had no choice — become self-employed. This arose in a case brought to my attention involving hauliers. They were originally employees of Roadstone but then became owner-drivers. They had an agreement with Roadstone but they have now discovered that Roadstone is directly employing drivers from eastern European countries. The original employees of Roadstone, who are now owner-drivers, are getting less work from Roadstone.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">When we examined this issue we found that the owner-drivers, even though they are members of trade unions, cannot have their trade union negotiate on their behalf with the company. This leaves them at a severe disadvantage. This issue must be addressed because it is another means to abuse workers. It can be used to displace people from their employment. These people have a difficulty asserting their rights, particularly through trade union membership. On the one hand they are allowed to be trade union members but they cannot negotiate with the company as members of that trade union. This must be addressed through legislation. It is a problem we have identified in our policy document.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">When the Labour Party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, raised these issues, the first people to criticise him were economists. The economists concerned spoke about the economy and the importance of growth. Those things are important but they are not the ultimate objective. They are the means to a better society. The economy is there to serve society, whether it is people who have immigrated to this country or natives of this country. That is where our immigration system should be pitched. Obviously, we must encourage growth and improve our economy but the purpose of that is to look after our people properly, be they immigrants or natives, and to provide a good quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">That is how we must think about our system. So far, our system has been focused on the employer and the economy but we are not thinking of those we should be thinking of, that is, people in our society. We should introduce a comprehensive immigration system based on the positive ideas I have proposed. It has been done in other countries, such as the United States. I do not claim their system is perfect but we have much to learn from it. There is no point labelling a work permit system as a green card system. What is needed is a proper green card system and a comprehensive immigration policy.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_385">I support the motion and urge the Government to give the proposals outlined by the Labour Party full and active consideration in the interests of the economic viability of communities throughout the country and the security and wellbeing of individual workers within the system. The continued prosperity of this country and its economic wellbeing and viability are dependent on such a commitment by the Government. Senator Mansergh, on the Order of Business today, pointed to the lack of a row-back by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The system must be seen to be fair and equal, with all areas of the country enjoying equity under employment policy. Longford and Westmeath are getting less than their fair share of State-assisted jobs. It is only approximately 3%. Now a disaster has temporarily destroyed the C&amp;D Foods company, which was the lynchpin of the Longford economy and one of the largest industrial and employment centres in the country. Future employment must be created in the constituency by attracting new industry and giving every possible support to C&amp;D Foods Limited to get its production up and running again in the shortest possible timescale.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The temporary closure of C&amp;D Foods Limited will have a serious impact on the economic life of County Longford and parts of County Westmeath. More than 40 40-foot containers left the factory each week. The spin off of the accident will be far-reaching in the business community in the midlands with up to 50 other companies directly or indirectly affected by the fire. The impact will be felt by every shop, pub, entertainment centre, bank, credit union, taxi and other business within a 30 miles radius of Edgeworthstown. The disaster was a bitter blow for the people of Longford-Westmeath and the Reynolds family. The effects of the fire are far-reaching for the people of the midlands, some of whom had four or five members of their families employed by the plant and whose lives were interlinked with its success over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">While praise is due to the management of the plant, who acted to reinstate 173 workers within a fortnight of the disaster, much needs to be done for the 300 remaining employees who have no realistic hope of resuming their jobs in the immediate future. The company has said that it will be at least 16 months before full production can resume. Following on the financial strains of Christmas, these workers are devastated by this terrible tragedy. I ask the Minister of State to set up a taskforce with the aim of providing support for families with mortgage payments and other commitments to meet with little means to do so. Security of existing jobs in the county is the main concern in the area and I hope the Minister will ensure these jobs are maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The progression of the decentralisation programme will now be more essential than ever to the area. The projected timescale for completion of the move by the Prison Service is September, involving approximately 143 jobs. This will provide a necessary boost to the hard hit population of Longford.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">In recent years we saw the failure of Cardinal Health to open a plant in Longford, with the resultant loss of 1,300 jobs, the failure to follow through on phase 2B of Mullingar Hospital, with the resultant lack of new employment possibilities, the fire at Glennon Sawmills outside Longford town, with a fall-off in employment, and the closure of the Glanbia meat factory in Rooskey on the Longford border, also due to a fire.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_395">With regard to this debate, it is important we ensure that work contracts with local authorities and other public bodies such as the health service, etc., meet minimum labour standards. Recently, a company employer on the power station in Lanesboro treated some of his workers very shabbily. I hope such incidents never happen again and it is up to the Government to ensure they do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I support the temporary workers agency directive. We must also extend equality legislation to cover people in domestic service, particularly home helps who provide valuable support to our sick and elderly. I raised this issue on numerous occasions in our previous session. Home helps looking after our sick and elderly must get status in the workforce. There are no regulations in place for the valuable work they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">We need to reform the existing work permits system so that we have a green card system which does not bind workers to a particular job. It is important we gather better data on labour market conditions in order to measure accurately the extent of displacement and wage degradation. The Government has been negligent in the area of FÁS schemes and has been all talk and no action. It has a stop-go attitude. People are taken on for one or two years and then midway through training they may be let go without any hope of employment. There must be more flexibility in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I compliment the fire services throughout the midlands for the excellent job they did during the crisis at Edgeworthstown. I support this Labour Party motion and hope the Minister takes note of and acts on it.</p>

        <speech by="#MargaretCox" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_399">I am delighted to see the Minister of State here and welcome the opportunity to speak on the amendment to this motion. It is important to speak and put forward the view which reflects the feelings of many small and medium-sized enterprises throughout the country. As the Government knows, indigenous industry is the lifeblood of our economy. The entrepreneurial spirit throughout the country has pulled our economy up by its bootstraps over the past number of years. This has been achieved by the men and women around the country who started small businesses in the service industry and manufacturing sub-supply industry to large multinationals. This all ties in well to the continued growth in employment and in the economy and continued prosperity through which we can provide social welfare services, schemes, training and health services, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The creation of an economy and the sustenance and management of that economy to ensure it maintains the environment necessary to allow our prosperity to continue and survive is one of the key challenges facing the Government. In the context of the forthcoming partnership talks, it is important — not to take away from anybody else's view — to bring an element of reality to our world as it is, a small island country operating in a global economy. This means we have many small and medium-sized organisations, or even a small section of a multinational organisation, that on a daily basis face the competitive challenges of other suppliers providing the same type of service or goods throughout the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I think of one in particular based in the north-western region. It is part of a worldwide multi-billion industry. It provides a service to its global corporation and is singularly the most expensive plant when looked at on a cost per product basis. On a daily basis it is fighting to survive by providing greater added value. Sometimes it does this by reducing costs without reducing the quality of its product and sometimes by taking in people on the minimum wage. In this regard we have introduced a minimum wage we have decided is acceptable. Throughout the country this type of company daily faces the global challenge of lower cost economies in China, India, the Philippines and around the world. Anything we do in terms of ensuring continued employment must include smaller companies. Not only must we look after the large added-value Microsoft and Intel industries, where people do great research and development work for which they get well paid, but we must look after smaller companies, ones that do not have this added value.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">We also have the challenge of ensuring we do not exploit lower paid workers. Whether these workers are from new European Union countries or from outside and working on a permit, we must give them the protection of Irish legislation. We must also ensure that all Departments involved in the management of this issue be given adequate resources so those standards are upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The main idea I want to put on the record is that we can go too far in one direction and therefore need to be careful. If, as a country, we cannot afford what we are trying to provide, we will not be able to survive. Anybody who runs a small business will note, on a daily basis from January onwards, the increasing number of letters from suppliers stating their costs have increased, including the costs of insurance, advertising and wages, such that they will have to charge more. Owners of companies who receive such letters must then send similar letters to the companies to which they are connected stating their costs have increased also and that they cannot employ the people they want at the rates they would like to pay. The global competitiveness of companies in this position is being eroded. It is also being eroded in the national economy because it is possible to buy many of the services we buy locally or nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Members will have read the recent analyses of our economic growth in recent years and the reasons for it. Let me refer to the lack of growth in the export industry. If we do not export more and more product to the extent we were exporting previously, given that we are now exporting less, we will become entirely dependent on the infrastructural projects under way at present. I refer to the many housing developments, the Dublin Port tunnel and the roads to Galway and Cork. If our economy is dependent on this type of growth, we will not be able to sustain our prosperity beyond the next ten to 15 years. Beyond that point we will have a more elderly population and our tax base will decrease. We will have to consider those on social welfare and provide them with pension cover — this is a separate challenge. We need to ensure that the country is in a position to survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Although there is a significant difference in opinion on both sides of the House we must look after people and ensure they are properly protected and paid for the work they do. The challenge is to prevent our creation of an Ireland in which nobody can afford to do business. This is a real challenge for us, including small business owners. I am sure the Minister of State meets the latter on a daily basis. I meet them quite often throughout the country and they say circumstances are becoming increasingly difficult. They refer to increased regulation, erosion of competitiveness and cost increases. They claim these detract from the objective of sustaining our prosperity and economy and ensuring we can live in the type of Ireland in which we want to live — the type of Ireland that looks after the sick, disabled and those who, for whatever reason, need help in looking after themselves. We must create a society of which we are proud, in which we can bring up our children and which we can hand on to the next generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I welcome the amendment. It is good to have these debates in the Seanad. For some reason we do not have them often. I would like to see the Minister of State coming to the House more frequently because one of the challenges we face is deciding on the future direction of the country. We should focus on this as one of the key aspects of sustaining our prosperity.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
          <p eId="para_407">I wish to speak in support of the amendment to the motion proposed by Senator Leyden. In so doing, I am sure the House will agree that no Government has been more committed to the social partnership process than this one and the previous one, led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern. No other Government has been prepared to utilise social partnership to the maximum in seeking to advance the social and economic objectives to which we all aspire.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">I want to show to this House how the Government and the social partners can work together to propose, negotiate and develop practical and achievable improvements in our workplaces, as well as the attainment of a fair and inclusive society. These are challenges which the Government set for itself in its programme for Government. The Government is proud of its achievements and can point to commitments delivered and progress made in the social partnership process.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">This commitment by the Government is well understood and acknowledged by the people, who in recent surveys have shown strong confidence in the capacity of the Government to maintain high employment and to deliver the conditions necessary to maintain the strong economic growth which underpins our social success. This Government is not about reducing the high employment standards we have attained. It is committed to working with the social partners not only to maintain but also to build upon and improve the conditions of those at work.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The social partnership process is accepted by all in this House, and by many countries and commentators overseas, as being a major contributor to the attainment of our societal goals. This is how it should be as it is an inclusive process which gives a voice and role to many constituencies, none more so than the unions and employers, together with the farming sector and the community and the voluntary groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Both employers and unions, through the National Implementation Body, have been clear in strongly recommending that negotiations on a new partnership agreement be commenced urgently, with a view to early agreement. This call has been heard by all parties and the process is under way which I hope will enable negotiations to get under way in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">In issuing its call to the parties, the National Implementation Body made the following recommendations to the social partners and the Government. First, there is a need to review, improve where necessary and promulgate the range of employment protection measures which apply to workers in the Irish economy on the lines of the terms of the Taoiseach's letter to the ICTU and related issues subsequently raised. Second, the process outlined above should comprehend in particular the incentives and disincentives within public policy which might influence decisions to substitute lower paid workers for those currently employed in existing positions. Third, there is a need to ensure that inspection and enforcement systems in respect of mandatory employment standards are effective in providing assurance both to employees and to responsible employers who meet fully their obligations. Fourth, the position of vulnerable workers who have re-located to Ireland from abroad should be the subject of a particular focus in these enforcement issues. Finally, the arrangements which the NIB envisages should arise from the foregoing recommendations to secure an appropriate balance between employment protection and labour market flexibility are best reflected in the terms of an agreement between the social partners and the Government, since such agreement provides the strongest assurance of the widest support and implementation of these measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The scene has been set, as the Taoiseach has already made clear. The Government will not be found wanting in contributing to the negotiations and the attainment of an agreement. As stated in the amendment to the motion, a meaningful package in the area of employment rights, standards, education, promotion, compliance and enforcement is appropriate to support the network of trust and the associated stability which has been developed over successive agreements. It is entirely appropriate that the social partners play an important role in the evolution and development of employment rights. It has been the practice of this Government to deal with legislative proposals, the transposition of EU directives and reviews of legislation or processes against a background of consultation with the social partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The development of employment and workplace entitlements always feature in the social partnership discussions and agreements and have, over recent times, led to legislation, increased entitlements and additional resources towards enforcement. I expect this will be the case in the event that the negotiations get under way in the near future. It is in the capacity of social partnership to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Government has been alert to the necessity of adapting employment rights, compliance and enforcement guidelines to changing circumstances. Following on commitments in the programme for Government and in Sustaining Progress, the Government has taken decisions to address the complexity of legislation in the employment rights area to improve understanding and compliance. It has established the employment rights group, in which the social partners and employment rights bodies participate, to oversee the development of proposals for Government for a simplified body of employment rights legislation. The group also guides and drives the implementation of the Government's decision on the role and functions of the employment rights bodies themselves to ensure user-friendly and simplified compliance, appeal and enforcement procedures are put in place, with all cases being dealt with initially by rights commissioners and only by the Employment Appeals Tribunal on appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The rights of workers from overseas are established by legislation as being equal to those of Irish workers. The vast majority of overseas workers have an entirely satisfactory interaction with the Irish labour market, which interaction is beneficial to all sides and the economy in general. However, there are instances in which overseas workers have not been getting their entitlements in certain sectors and particularly in cases where they may have been relatively isolated. It was for this reason that the Government increased the number of labour inspectors last March to an all-time high of 31. These inspectors are in place, have completed their initial training and are now conducting inspections.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Conscious of the position on employment rights compliance, and in accordance with the commitment in Sustaining Progress, the Government completed a review of the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate. The review, which was not prescriptive, presented the arguments for and against an extensive range of issues impacting on the inspectorate. Having obtained the views of the social partners, the Government established the employment rights compliance group, on which the social partners were represented, to identify a compliance model which was both effective and efficient in enabling people to establish their entitlements and to ensure compliance. Much has been agreed during the course of the review. Final comments from the social partners will be reflected in the report and the remaining issues relating to the compliance model, and the organisational aspects, have been clearly signalled as being matters for consideration in any forthcoming social partnership discussions. The Government has every confidence that agreement will be reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">More needs to be done in regard to the promotion of employment rights entitlements to employers, employees and migrant workers in particular. For approximately five years employment rights literature has been available in nine different languages and is distributed not only through the work permit system but also through embassies in Ireland, as well as through citizen information centres. This has been followed by a pilot scheme currently under way, whereby classes in basic employment rights are given to migrant workers in their own language. In this I must commend ICTU for its initiative and signal that I would endorse this greater support for the social partners for educational and promotional purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Many workers from overseas work in sectors which are covered by the joint labour committee, JLC, system, where their terms and conditions are negotiated and agreed by the social partners within the framework of that system. The resulting agreements become employment regulation orders once cleared by the Labour Court and are enforceable through the labour inspectorate or directly with the employment rights bodies themselves. This is a robust approach which has worked well for many years. As part of Sustaining Progress, the Government undertook a review of the JLC system by outside consultants, following which the Government entered into consultations with the social partners with a view to developing proposals to further refine the system. These proposals will contribute to any forthcoming social partnership negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The Government delivers on its commitments and, in making preparations for a further social partnership agreement, has developed strong and deliverable proposals across a range of areas to meet the issues which Government wishes to address and also to meet the concerns identified by the National Implementation Body. The resulting package for consideration within the social partnership negotiations will cover employment standards, employment rights education and promotion and employment compliance and enforcement, together with a range of issues which are appropriate to the social partnership negotiation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I propose to address a number of discrete issues which are relevant to the motion and the amendment before the House. I will begin with employment rights. The existing very formidable corpus of legislation and associated rights and protection must be borne in mind in a debate of this kind as we are sometimes asked to react as if there were no social and employment protection framework in place in this State. The challenge in a rapidly growing economy is to ensure that there is adequate, timely and effective enforcement of compliance with the statutory and other provisions now in place. I have already referred to recent developments in this regard and I am quite sure that these will be the subject of further consideration in any forthcoming negotiations with the social partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, explained to the House in his opening address on Second Stage of the Employment Permits Bill 2005, on 12 October last, the reasons the Government decided that work permits and green cards for certain highly-skilled and highly-paid employees would be predicated on the offer of a job. Such a system would certainly be more flexible and responsive to the needs of the economy than the green card system being advocated by the Labour Party, which it describes but does not define. International experience has shown that alternative systems such as points or quotas create an undesirable and unnecessary level of bureaucracy, a mismatch between available skills and labour requirements, and entail forecasting future needs, which is difficult to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The Employment Permits Bill also provides a great degree of mobility for holders of work permits or green cards. There will be an automatic right to change employer after 12 months and a right which may be exercised with the agreement of the Minister during the first 12 months of employment. Additionally, in future the permit or green card will be granted to the employee and this document will contain valuable information for the protection of the employee, including the right to be paid at least the national minimum wage, which is the second highest in the EU, the prohibition on the deduction of recruitment expenses and the retention of personal documents by employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Ireland's position as regards the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families is no different from that of any of our EU partners, none of which is party to or has signed the convention. An examination of the EU convention by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs has shown that ratification would require significant and far-reaching changes across a wide range of existing legislation, including legislation addressing the authorisation to stay and to work, education and training, health and medical care and electoral matters. These changes would also have implications for our relations with our EU partners and possibly for the operation of the common travel area between Ireland and the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">With regard to employment and displacement, since EU enlargement in May 2004, the domestic labour market is effectively the 25 member states of the EU. Irish employers are free to hire anybody from any of these member states and Irish workers are free to work in any of these states, either temporarily or permanently. I am aware of concerns expressed that Irish employers are replacing Irish workers with workers from overseas at lower rates of pay or on poorer conditions. However, we have full employment and a very buoyant labour market situation, with low unemployment and with many workers from overseas successfully finding employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">To date, it appears that any degree of displacement is not being reflected in higher unemployment. Nevertheless, the Government will, of course, listen carefully and respond in the course of any social partnership negotiations. The Government is committed to avoiding a race to the bottom and the Taoiseach has made it very clear that the Government does not want to see people building competitive advantage based on poor wages, casualisation of labour, low health and safety standards or other poor compliance standards. This is not a race to the bottom but rather a race to the top as we upskill to strengthen our employment capacity and growth potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">In a modern, competitive economy, where goods and services are freely traded, the concept of job security is changing. The days when an employee might expect to stay with the same employer for a lifetime are largely gone, as are the days when defensive action by a combination of the State and other domestic interests could shelter sectors of the economy from international competition. The benefits of the newly-integrated international economy can be seen in full employment, healthy public finances and improved public services in Ireland. The ready supply of relatively cheap consumer goods has contributed to the rise in living standards of the great mass of Irish people, including those on low incomes. Ireland and the Irish workforce have been major beneficiaries of the growing global economy and part of the public policy challenge is to ensure that we continue to benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The experience of Ireland in recent years may be unique in our history but it is by no means unique in terms of international experience. Other societies have adapted well to new challenges and there is no reason this society cannot forge its own way to a new equilibrium. Part of this process of adaptation involves the identification and promotion of those factors that can contribute to quality work and greater employment security in the circumstances of the new economy. International experience in recent years suggests that, instead of job security being guaranteed by traditional economic structures and State regulation, individual employees can find greater economic security through greater flexibility, underpinned by continuous training and development. This calls not only for a supportive environment being provided by employers and the State but also for a positive and personal commitment from individual workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">As an indication of the forward-looking stance being adopted by the Government in regard to the changing workplace, the Taoiseach last March launched the report of the forum on the workplace of the future, Working to our Advantage: A National Workplace Strategy. If we are to meet the challenges presented by the globalised 21st century market, our workplaces must be geared for constant change and innovation. All involved — employers, employees, policy makers and social partners — need a shared understanding of what needs to be done, particularly at the level of the workplace. This is the basis upon which the national workplace strategy has been developed. This is the first time the workplace is the focus of a national report, and deservedly so. The workplace can be seen as the hub of the Irish economy. It is where employers and employees interact, where productivity happens and where competitiveness is forged. It provides employers, shareholders and employees with the resources to live their lives, and provides the national economy with the factors that make it thrive.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The report presents a vision of the workplace of the future as being agile, customer-centred, knowledge-intensive, responsive to employee needs, networked, highly-productive, involved, participatory, continually learning and increasingly diverse. In identifying the gaps in Irish workplaces, the report focuses on five strategic priorities: commitment to workplace innovation; capacity for change; developing future skills; access to opportunities; and quality of working life. I chair the high-level implementation group which is overseeing the national workplace strategy which will provide a comprehensive framework to assist and support workplaces to meet the challenge of enhancing Ireland's economic competitiveness and performance. The national workplace strategy underlines the need to move forward with an increased emphasis on adaptability, high performance, employee involvement, innovation, learning and skill development.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Change has become a constant feature of economic life. In Ireland and the EU, and across the world, all sectors are affected by change and restructuring. The structure of employment is moving ever further away from traditional sectors to new, rapidly expanding service activities, many of which require different forms of work organisation. There is an increased need for flexibility in the workplace and both business and employees have to be able to adapt to new ways of working. The national workplace strategy highlights the various steps that are required to ensure improved adaptability in Irish workplaces. The State has a significant role in providing a responsive regulatory framework, which ensures that a flexible workforce does not suffer from a lack of social protection. This approach, however, requires a balanced contribution from all players. It cannot work if all the flexibility is demanded from employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">In recent years the Government has sought to link and promote the related concepts of flexibility and security through labour market initiatives involving tax and secondary benefits which have made it easier for unemployed or otherwise economically inactive persons to enter or re-enter the workforce. These have proceeded with significant development in the areas of training and lifelong learning. "Flexicurity" was the theme of last week's Council of Minister's meeting chaired by the Austrian Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The draft directive on services has recently aroused much comment and controversy. The Government considers that a single market in services would be in Ireland's interest in terms of employment prospects, trade opportunities, consumer choice and welfare enhancement. Since the draft directive was tabled over two years ago it has been subject to a largely technical examination in the Council of Ministers. The technical experts have been clarifying the various elements of the proposal ahead of the consideration by the competitiveness council of the main policy issues, including the country of origin principle on which the Council of Ministers has not yet reached any decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Some stakeholders have expressed concerns that the country of origin principle might circumvent our employment law. The Government shared these concerns and successfully sought changes to the text of the original Commission proposal to clarify this issue. The most recent draft of the proposal includes significant improvements in the area of labour law. While this is not a formal new proposal it is a good indication of what the member states can and cannot agree. As a result of the changes, our employment law would apply to all workers posted to this country and to all workers who obtain employment here. I made Ireland's position in this regard very clear in Austria last Friday.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Workers posted to work in Ireland from other EU member states have the protection of all Irish employment legislation in the same way as employees who have an Irish contract of employment. This is covered by section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 which states that all employment legislation which confers rights or entitlements on an employee applies to a posted worker in the same way that it applies to any other employee. As the Industrial Relations Act 1946 applies to posted workers, all collective agreements registered under that Act also apply to posted workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">There are approximately 60 binding registered employment agreements to protect employment standards, many of which cover the services sector. They cover statutory minimum rates of pay and other conditions of work and would continue in force if the services directive were adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Much work remains to be done on the draft directive before it is agreed by the Council of Ministers. The Commission will come forward with new proposals in the next few months, especially on the country of origin aspect. Let us wait and see what it proposes, then we will continue to avail of every opportunity to protect our interests under the directive. We will go through a consultative process with the stakeholders, including the social partners. This process has been totally open and transparent, and has been open for all to follow on my Department's website. In light of those consultations we will formulate a position which is in the best interests of Ireland and Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The Commission's amended proposal for the draft directive on temporary agency workers of November 2002 was the subject of detailed consideration by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on many occasions between 2002 and the end of 2004. No agreement, however, could be reached on compromise proposals tabled by presidencies over that period. The differences between member states have, if anything, widened as the new member states adopted positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The directive is stalled. Should the Austrian Presidency re-open discussions on the proposal Ireland will be willing to participate in a compromise that meets its requirement of ensuring that temporary work can continue to provide a firm path to full-time employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">It is anticipated that some of the issues under consideration here today will also be addressed in the context of the Green Paper on the evolution of labour law, in preparation in the Commission. This will consider the implications for maintaining standards as workers become increasingly mobile. Ireland will take a close interest in this work this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Turning closer to home, the question of employees being classified as sub-contractors, particularly in the construction sector, is a matter of concern. There has been a substantial increase in the level of Revenue activities around the construction industry in 2005, enhanced by several new special compliance initiatives. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners recently informed the Committee of Public Accounts that for 2006, Revenue would devote 25% of its audit resource to policing building-related sectors. As part of this national project, the issue of misclassification of building operatives as self-employed will be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">In the context of so-called bogus self-employment in the construction industry, the Labour Court recently made a significant decision on the registered employment agreement, REA, in this area. In this case, the employer maintained that two workers were employed as self-employed sub-contractors and accordingly not covered by the construction industry REA. The court concluded, however, that the workers were covered by the REA. The Labour Court was guided by a 2005 High Court case which found that the definition of a "worker" in the 1990 Industrial Relations Act is wide enough to include an individual sub-contractor.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Thus, a worker in one of the designated occupations covered by the REA who is engaged by a building or civil engineering firm is entitled to all the benefits of the agreement and an employer may not avoid liability under the agreement by seeking to designate the worker as an independent contractor. This decision of the Labour Court will inform discussions at any social partnership negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Under the current conditions of contract for Departments and local authorities there is a requirement that contractors pay rates of wages and observe hours of labour and conditions of employment in public procurement not less favourable than those laid down by the national joint industrial council for the construction industry. I hope this contract-based approach to compliance can be extended.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">On the issue of a joint labour committee for domestic workers, the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004 cover all employees in domestic service regardless of race or gender. The scope of the Acts is comprehensive and covers discrimination in respect of access to employment, conditions of employment, equal pay for work of equal value, training, promotion and work experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">While not specifically relevant to the issue of amending equality legislation, the suggestion of establishing a joint labour committee for domestic workers has recently been raised. I have asked the Department to consult with the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission on the practicalities of establishing a new joint labour committee for domestic workers. The critical issue here is that under the Industrial Relations Act 1946, a joint labour committee can be established only on the basis of an approach made to the Labour Court by a trade union or any organisation or group of persons claiming to be representative of relevant workers or of relevant employers. I also have a role but the issue revolves around representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The range of issues I have mentioned is not comprehensive but it gives this House a sense of the capacity of social partnership to engage and contribute. It is a valuable process and the outcomes achieved reflect the commitment of all parties to the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Government delivers on its commitments in social partnership, be they pay increases, improvements in redundancy payments, development and enactment of legislation or improvements across the whole range of employment rights and entitlements. Many issues need to be addressed in any forthcoming social partnership negotiation in which all parties will have to contribute and compromise. I am confident, however, on the basis of the trust and proven commitment of all parties, that the outcome will contribute to our shared vision of a successful society. The Government is committed to, has delivered on and will contribute to, and continue to deliver on, social partnership.</p>

It is a pity he was not here for the Order of Business today because my colleague, Senator Ross, raised an important point about the transfer of powers extra-democratically to this unelected and not entirely representative body. I agree with the Minister of State that social partnership and such discussions have laid the foundation for much of our economic and social progress, whose results I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">There is, however, to use a cliché, a democratic deficit. Members on both sides of the House this morning suggested that representatives of the social partners come into the House to engage in an information and question session. This would be very useful because it would bring this type of negotiation back into the democratic process. I hope the Minister of State will support that call and assist us in responding to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">I regret the fact that there is an amendment to the motion. What is the point of it? The motion is concerned with the protection of workers, developing registered employment agreements, devoting increased resources to the labour inspectorate, and ensuring enforcement and Revenue inspection. We all know that is right. The Minister of State could not possibly quibble with any single item in the motion, yet we get this stupid, knee-jerk reaction all the time, which is demeaning politics. It is a case of the Government side saying "White" if the Opposition says "Black". If an Opposition motion states anything, the Government amends it by deleting everything in the text and saying "We commend the Government for its wonderful work". The public is not fooled by this and it is a waste of time. If only we could get together and agree a central ground in the interests not of our parties but of the workers of this country, we would be much better off.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The Gama construction workers are mentioned in the motion. It is a shame and a reproach on every party in this House that it took Deputy Joe Higgins, the Independent Socialist Member in the other House, to unearth this scandal which had been concealed. All the matters which have been correctly mentioned by the Labour Party were found not to have been operated properly. It was only the investigative action of Deputy Joe Higgins that managed to bring this matter to the surface and rescue the situation for Gama workers. That is a great pity.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The fact that these abysmal conditions exist can be ascertained by putting a human face to them. I wish to cite some quotations that were issued from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. A chef from Romania stated, "I moved to Ireland in 2001 on a work permit. Since then I've had five or six jobs. In my last job I started on €2 an hour". I pay my cleaning lady €20 an hour. What is the minimum wage, it is €9 or €10 per hour?</p>

          <p eId="para_464">Well, €2 is less than a third of that. Sarah, a domestic worker from Sri Lanka, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_465">The December 2004 tsunami destroyed my family's land. My father and uncles have no work. I have to stay here so I can send money to them. One day, my employer threw a wet, dirty cloth in my face and told me to clean the floors. Her children sat at the kitchen table laughing at me. I cried and went to my room. I am regularly used as target practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Akim, an asylum seeker from Nigeria, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_467">My employer, who is a farmer, paid me just over €2 an hour to pick fruit and stones and do other general work. I work long hours. I worked until my hands bled.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">That is slavery. Apart from anything else, nobody will pay a blind bit of notice to this debate. It is over the critical time period and we will never get this onto "Oireachtas Report" or anywhere else. Therefore, instead of fighting for a mean-minded and stupid advantage, why do we not do the decent thing, unite and accept that we need to assist people in these critical situations. I applaud the Labour Party for tabling this motion which I intend to support.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I welcome the call in the motion for reform of the existing work permit system to allow for a green card. Last night, I had a meal with a friend who is from outside this country. He is a decent lad who regularly attends a gym. He was complaining because he pays his taxes and is legally resident here. He does very good work for this country. The gym he attends is full of Polish, Latvian and other workers who are employed by builders. I know that those in the construction industry are good friends of the present Government, but sometimes one must look at one's friends. Those workers in the gym were being paid €50 or €100 a day in cash. In Britain, when Irish labourers were treated like this it was called the lump. They used to go off and spend all their money on drink. As we speak, however, we have that situation in this country. Of the 20 people from various eastern European countries to whom my friend spoke in the gym last week, not one of them paid a cent in tax, although they were earning reasonably good money. My pal is not a mean-minded person. Quite reasonably, however, he said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_470">I pay my taxes. These people are making large amounts of money. The entrepreneur is doing well out of it, but what happens when one of them gets sick? We'll all have to pay out of our taxes to keep them in hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">In equity, therefore, we need to examine both ends of the scale — people who are illegally kept in slavery, and foolish workers who, like many Irish people in the past, take cash wages, do not register for income tax and then expect the State to support them. This is a great pity.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I welcome the green card proposal, but I do not think it goes far enough. I accept the response of ICTU which described it as a bad and defective law that needed a good deal of amendment. I will instance a couple of matters to which the Minister of State referred in his speech. One is the question of work permits. There is a real problem in that people are dependent on their employers for the permits. The green card proposal is supposed to get around that difficulty but it does not because the ownership of the work permit does not transfer. It should be in the possession of the worker. Why can workers not be allowed to have such permits legally? Currently, it is up to a new employer to obtain a new work permit, which is a mistake. There should be a transferable work permit attaching to the worker and his or her talents. This is a serious and important point because if such workers want to change jobs, the prospective employer must obtain a new permit. That is wrong in my opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The Minister of State has indicated that under the proposed legislation, green card holders will be allowed to bring their spouses to Ireland. That is true up to a certain point, but I would like to hear a full articulation of the Government's policy regarding the reunification of families. That has not happened and it is not exclusively the prerogative of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Another problem is a domestic Irish one which fits into this debate. It is a scandalous situation concerning Irish Actors Equity. I will declare my interest here because I am a member of three trade unions. Earlier today, Senator Ross claimed he was a member of a trade union, but I am member of three — the Irish Federation of University Teachers, the National Union of Journalists, and Irish Actors Equity. We had an extraordinary situation in Irish Actors Equity whereby the Competition Authority, mar dhea, coerced it into signing an agreement whereby it would not represent freelance actors. It signed an agreement that it would not even provide or share with any self-employed actor undertakings or information relating to minimum fees to be paid to other self-employed actors. What is going on here? It cannot publish a fees guide for freelance photographers or reporters either. In addition, where named musicians are being engaged, the Musicians Union is prohibited from telling its members what is the going rate. That is farcical. The Minister of State should get stuck in and resolve the situation. These rights were enjoyed by Irish workers since 1901, yet the Competition Authority has seen fit to try to take them away.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">This shames all of us because we are supposed to be a cultured country and we have contributed enormously not only to the culture of Europe but also of the world. However, the average overall payment for performing artists in specialised areas is €7,200 a year. Income from all theatre work is €10,000, while the rate for performing artists is €5,000. The Minister of State can read the figures in the report for himself. People are earning this pittance but it is nonsense to have the Competition Authority, which is a statutory body, stating that these poor devils cannot be told the going rate for a job. The Government should examine the matter.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_476">I am delighted that this debate is taking place because I have just returned from Latvia which is currently sending us many workers. While I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been in discussion with his Latvian counterpart, who opened the conference I attended, I would like to read some extracts from this month's <i>Baltic Guide</i>, which is widely distributed in Latvia in English and, I presume, in other languages as well. The heading of the article is “Not very funny mushrooms”. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_477">Thousands of Latvians have headed for other European Union countries, especially Ireland. They earn their former daily salary in an hour, picking mushrooms, milking cows, working in factories and doing other menial tasks the Irish no longer want to do. Since Latvia joined the EU last May, the UK and Sweden have given Latvian citizens the right to work without a work permit. About 150,000 new workers — mostly Poles, Lithuanians and Latvians — have officially registered in Ireland, although the actual figure may be much higher.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_478">Help wanted ads in Irish papers appear in Russian and Latvian to help the new immigrants find jobs. Many say they hope to return to Latvia and buy a home or farm, and hope they will one day be able to prosper in their homeland. In Ireland they often work gruelling hours, living a dozen to a house or in a factory trailer, all in the name of money.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_479">The mass emigration is also causing a new sad trend, so called "mushroom orphans", or children left behind in Latvia with neighbours or relatives as their parents go off to pick mushrooms. Another side effect: husbands leaving with the intention of working for a few months to raise money, then abandoning their Latvian family and creating a new one abroad.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_480">Ireland, at least, views the new immigrants positively and officials say the influx of Latvians has been good for the economy. Balts work hard and are willing to take low-level jobs that upwardly mobile Irish avoid. Indeed, more than 400,000 trade unionists protested in Dublin in early December when the Irish Ferries company began introducing Latvian labourers, who were willing to work for lower wages.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_481">The Latvian Government hopes the migrants will come back, armed with new skills and languages. Migration studies, however, suggest that two-thirds will never return.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I felt rather sad when I read that article, since I did not feel that this was the picture of working in Ireland that I wanted presented. Another article on the Irish Ferries dispute stated the following.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_483">Many Irish citizens feel that if the restructuring plan goes ahead, other Irish companies will carry out similar restructuring programmes. Any such trend will no doubt suit many Latvian immigrant workers in the short-term, but it is sure to foster further resentment and racism towards Latvians living in Ireland. Furthermore, it must be hoped that Latvian salaries will rapidly catch up with the EU average or the country will suffer from a "people drain" to add to the brain drain already occurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Those were on pages 3 and 4 of a widely distributed journal, and I was very sorry to readthem.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Perhaps I might comment on one other group, which I am glad was addressed in the Minister of State's speech, namely, the situation regarding domestic workers. I also found that a source of concern, and I admit that I was with female parliamentarians from the Baltic area who took a particular interest in what work their young women might become involved in when they went abroad. There was great concern that, because of what is described as the growth in our adult entertainment industry, some young women who come to work here in domestic service and find that they are incredibly badly paid and cannot survive will be tempted to join the ranks of those dancing naked in the new clubs which have now been permitted. Naturally, it is much easier for a stranger to the country to appear naked or very scantily clad in these joints than for Irishwomen, who might fear seeing their neighbours from down the road, no matter how enthusiastic they may be about dancing.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">We must take a special interest in social aspects of workers' lives here. When I returned on the aeroplane from Latvia, I saw that those coming over were incredibly young — I would have thought that the majority were between 20 and 25. One is very vulnerable when one is in a strange country at that age, and I suggest that we must address not simply the economic aspects of the issue but the social ones too. When people are living in a strange country, they are far more vulnerable to being exploited than in their own home place with the backup of family and so forth. I hope that the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, will also consider that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The tone of these articles is very sad, pointing out the disparity in wages and also what Irish people are apparently content to offer workers who come here. Someone is going back and telling these stories to reporters in Latvia. From what other speakers have said, there seems no evidence to suggest that those stories are in any way untrue. I know the Minister of State to be a good-hearted person, and I sincerely hope that in addressing this issue, he will not simply address the economics but also the social issues. I do not wish to see the Crisis Pregnancy Agency making a special effort to help those who have come from abroad. I hope that this side of employment in this country will also be addressed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_491">The Government had our support in allowing free access to this country for citizens of the accession states. However, we did not support it when it decided to load the dice against them by telling them that they would have no access to social assistance until they had been here for two years, therefore putting them in a non-negotiating position with employers. Happily, and not for the first time, the EU has now forced the Government to accord those recently arrived and very welcome guests some rights if treated badly by an Irish employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I apologise to the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, that I was not here for his speech. Unfortunately, I had two meetings to attend simultaneously. However, I read his script carefully. I have great regard for the Minister of State, who is the nicest of men, but I am tired of the Government's hand-wringing woe regarding the exploitation of workers. It is not that hard to do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">It is worth pointing out that it was the last national agreement that proposed an increase in the number of inspectors. It is now January 2006, a time when we are beginning to negotiate the next one, and the Minister of State has only now said that it will happen, because someone in Government sat on the proposal for years. One cannot believe that the delay happened because it was forgotten about. It was because the Government did not want to expand the numbers of inspectors, since it did not want the resulting greater number of inspections.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">We have that over and over. It took a series of dreadful tragedies in the building industry to get the Health and Safety Authority off its behind and start enforcing the law. We were also tired of the authority turning up to investigate after the event. I remember how Mr. Justice Kelly wondered how it had taken it so long before it took a case to court regarding lack of safety and closed down an entire Zoe Developments site because of its appalling safety practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">We now have the beginnings of serious efforts at safe practice in the building industry, but it took years. Will we now go through the same process again regarding every issue that we raised today? Nowhere in the Minister of State's script can I find any commitment to examining whether the stories that we are all hearing of individuals here, there and everywhere being treated badly, manipulated and abused are simply isolated incidents. Why do they not find out what is happening by asking and looking? They do not want to find out the truth. I should have known from the very beginning that if the Progressive Democrats were keen on having a vast number of workers enter this country from the EU, it would be to look after their friends in business rather than the immigrants. We must be very careful here.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The issue Senator Norris raised is extremely threatening for people because if the Competition Authority is right that competition law precludes people who are nominally self-employed from joining a trade union and using a trade union to negotiate a collective position for them, the 70,000 so-called self-employed in the building industry will not be allowed to have a trade union represent them, even if the Labour Court rules, as the Minister told us, that they have the right to the same standards as those in the building industry. They will not be allowed even to talk to each other. That is what the Competition Authority forced SIPTU to do in the case of actors. It will apply similarly to other people who are self-employed. The Government is the only body that can change that by changing the industrial relations legislation and ensuring that the Competition Authority butts out of this area and deals with those who are ripping off the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I was intrigued by Senator Cox's constructive and thoughtful contribution. She was wrong, however, because there is no conflict between good-quality, well-paid employment, with good social protection, and success in the world economy. If we want evidence of that, and nobody wants to do this, we should look to Germany. In spite of its domestic market problems, Germany is the world's most successful exporter in terms of innovation, technology and its capacity to compete. It does not do that by ripping off workers but by creating a genuine social partnership, which this country has never really got into because a genuine social partnership means that the burdens and the benefits are shared. As far as I am concerned, it is more and more the case that social partnership in Ireland means workers sharing the burdens and big business holding on to most of the benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">It is a great pity that the Government decided to amend what was an innocuous enough motion calling for measures on which I thought everybody in this country was agreed.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_172">
            <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
            <p eId="para_544">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue and the Minister of State for coming to the House. We have a considerable amount of water schemes in County Galway and I estimate the county has the greatest number of water schemes in the country. I am slightly disappointed that both group water schemes and public water schemes have not progressed recently as much as I would have wished. Allegations have been made that Galway County Council has not spent all of the money allocated for group water schemes. From conversations I have had with some councillors they would contest this claim. A considerable amount of money has been spent on water schemes, a trend which should continue for both group water schemes and public water schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_545">The amount spent on sewerage schemes under construction amounts to €26 million, and €68 million will be spent on water and sewerage schemes in County Galway this year. It is disappointing that many of the smaller schemes listed in 2002 and 2003, and possibly earlier than this, appear to have been put on the 2007 list. Twelve of the schemes on the 2007 list cost less than €5 million. The smaller schemes, which make up the majority of the schemes in question, should be dealt with before 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_546">Some schemes were completed in the past under the reed bed system. The scheme in Williamstown in County Galway is an example of such a scheme. The cost of these schemes was less than 50% of the cost of a traditional scheme. Many towns have inadequate sewerage schemes and improvements to such schemes are included in the programme for 2006 and 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_547">"Design build operate" is a phrase used in connection with the construction of schemes. The scheme in Milltown in north Galway was once a standalone scheme but is now included in a group, as are schemes in Dunmore and Kilkerran. The schemes in the latter two locations are treated in conjunction with Leenane in west Galway. While I always believed it would be a good idea to use the design build operate model, I am concerned about schemes which were standalone but are now being included in bundled schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_548">I was pleased to hear the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government say before Christmas that schemes costing less than €5 million could be fast-tracked and that local authorities would not be forced to send every scheme to the Department. This is a very good idea. Allowing the county council to deal with schemes would be very welcome in a county like Galway, which has a considerable number of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_549">I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the progress of a scheme. A particular scheme looks like a very good idea, is drawn up, approved by the council and goes out to consultants. The next thing we hear is that the scheme must be enlarged, for example, it must be enlarged by a quarter of a mile on one road or half a mile on another road. The matter then returns to the Department because the scheme must be costed again, which causes significant delay. The estimated cost of schemes scheduled to start in 2007 is €256 million. I would like to have seen these schemes started this year. Progress on the 12 schemes that cost less than €5 million, such as those in Milltown and Kinvara, would be welcome. The Kinvara scheme has been raised in the Seanad by Senator Ulick Burke, in Galway County Council and in the European Parliament with regard to pollution and the threat to the environment. The Minister should eliminate some of the red tape and then we would have a great opportunity to give every small town and village a sewerage scheme and progress with the water schemes which need much more investment.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. B. O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_550">I thank Senator Kitt for raising an important national issue. I hope the information I am now going to provide will satisfy him that we are making real progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">Providing modern water services infrastructure to support social and economic objectives has been a major focus of Government spending over the past number of years. There has been unprecedented investment by my Department under the national development plan on water and sewerage schemes and this has made a key contribution to the economic growth that has benefited every part of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_552">My Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-07, published last month, includes some 60 major water and sewerage schemes, with a value of over €451 million, for Galway. Many areas of the county, such as Carna-Kilkieran, Tuam and Headford will benefit from improved water supplies. Also included are new regional water supply schemes for Costelloe, Gort, Ballinasloe, Clifden, Loughrea, Dunmore-Glenamaddy and Portumna. All these schemes will play a major role in the development of the residential, tourism and commercial sectors of these areas. In addition, towns and villages such as Athenry, Ballinasloe, Barna, Carraroe, Clifden, Glenamaddy, Headford, Milltown, Oughterard and Tuam can also look forward to new or upgraded sewerage schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_553">I am as anxious as the Senator to see all these schemes get to construction and completion as quickly as possible and my Department is doing everything it can to ensure this happens. However, the Senator will appreciate that multi-million euro schemes that are being funded by the taxpayer must go through detailed planning and development processes to ensure they meet their intended objectives, are designed and constructed in an economical manner and produce drinking water or treated waste water to a standard that meets national and EU requirements. Moreover, the acquisition of land or completion of statutory planning procedures such as environmental impact assessments cannot be achieved overnight but must be completed before tenders can be invited for the construction of any scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">Over the years my Department has consistently delegated more and more responsibilities to local authorities to speed up the procurement of new water services infrastructure. For example, once the preliminary report for a project costing up to €2.5 million is approved under my Department's water services investment programme, the local authority can generally proceed to construction without further reference to the Department. I want to extend this devolution of functions further and I have recently announced that for every project in the water services investment programme valued under €5 million — there are 291 of them — local authorities will henceforth be entitled, after they receive preliminary approval, to proceed right through to construction without further reference to my Department. This will give local authorities unprecedented authority to advance individual schemes with a minimum of Departmental involvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_555">I hope the result will be a significant speeding up of hundreds of individual schemes from drawing board through to completion. It will also mean that my Department's expertise can be concentrated on advancing bigger and more costly projects. The Senator will also be glad to learn that, as a particular measure to help Galway, my Department agreed last year to fund the costs of two additional engineering posts in Galway County Council's water services section. Much of the function will now fall on the local councillors to ensure their local authorities will expedite projects costing under €5 million because the responsibility has now been devolved to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_556">On the rural water side, I am particularly pleased to acknowledge the great efforts being made by all the rural water stakeholders in County Galway to address the pressing problem of quality-deficient group water schemes. Approximately 15,000 rural households are dependent on group water schemes in County Galway. I am determined that funding will not be a constraint on the task of bringing over 100 quality-deficient group water schemes in the county up to standard. Spending nationally on rural water has increased dramatically, from around €15 million in 1997 to €119 million in 2005. This is real progress by any yardstick.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">As the Senator is aware, responsibility for the administration of the devolved rural water programme rests with the county councils. It is a matter for each county council to determine and implement its annual programme of work. Over the three-year period 2002 to 2004, Galway County Council underspent its block grant allocation for rural water by over €8 million. This included an amount of €1.133 million earmarked for small public water and sewerage schemes. There is a lesson to be learned there. We must be far more energetic locally to ensure the council officials meet the demands and spend the money given to them during the year in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_558">I am pleased that Galway County Council is now giving the upgrading of rural water schemes the priority and attention it deserves. In 2005 the council looked for funding for an ambitious programme of work that focussed on the provision of new, stand-alone water treatment plants for up 60 group water schemes with poor quality private sources. In response to the council's ambitious plans a record capital allocation of over €14 million was provided last year for rural water plus a further €410,000 to meet the council's administration and technical costs. I understand that construction is currently under way on the provision of 17 group scheme treatment plants that together will serve around 3,500 Galway households. Planning is well advanced on further contracts to provide fully treated water for up to 40 more group schemes serving over 6,000 households. Good progress is also being made on connecting quality-deficient group schemes to the county's expanding regional water scheme network.</p>
            <p eId="para_559">The 2005 programme targets set by the council for 2005 were fully realised and the €14 million allocation was drawn down in its entirety. Galway County Council has submitted another ambitious programme of rural water activities for 2006. I am at present examining all the local authorities' proposals and I will be announcing the 2006 allocations shortly. There is already an unbroken eight-year record of increased rural water spending and I intend for this year's allocation to ensure that record is more than maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_563">When he comes one of the first things he will see is the fine castle. This is a fine example of a circular keep, is in good order and is a symbol of the town. It is located in the town near the church, the courthouse, the jail and other buildings of significance and heritage. It has been the dream of many people in Nenagh that the castle and its environs would be developed as a tourism project. It is urgent that this happens because Nenagh does not have any natural tourist draw and this project could be that draw. Many people have worked hard for this and Shannon Development — when it was allowed to develop regional tourism — was very supportive as well. The political forces in the town have supported this project, including Nenagh Town Council. The council put its money where its mouth was and purchased two buildings on Pearse Street in order to allow an access on to the street. The permission was not granted for the demolition of the two buildings so we are now in a different scenario.</p>
            <p eId="para_564">In recent times, I and other public representatives were asked by Nenagh Town Council to contact the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding this issue. The council would like to obtain legal control of the property around the castle so that it can carry out works. At the moment, there is also some anti-social activity in the area and it is gathering litter. If the town council had legal control over it, the area could be developed into a public park and a nice amenity. The town council asked for a meeting with the Minister but did not receive a reply until recently. In November, I received a reply from the Minister on this issue. In it, he requested me to ask the OPW to carry out yet another report on the project. Rather than proceeding as the OPW proposed, the Minister has now asked the OPW to go back to square one. This means that more time will elapse before anything happens. In his letter, the Minister states that he has requested the OPW to carry out a further study in accordance with details outlined in the letter. This would result in a scaled down project. It is my concern that the Minister is planning to scale down the project and do less than the community wants to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_565">Effectively, the clock could go backwards on this project, which is very important to the town. The Minister may know that representatives from his own party gave many commitments on this issue in the past. It is vital for the tourism potential of Nenagh, which is simply not being realised. However, if the castle project could be developed, much more would follow, such as a heritage centre in the jail. The OPW is currently finishing what looks like a magnificent job on the courthouse, just across the road from the castle. There is the potential for the development of a number of fine buildings, most of them heritage buildings. I appeal to the Minister to speed up this project and to communicate with Nenagh Town Council. There will be no solid progress on this issue without that level of communication and drive from the Department.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_178" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Mr. B. O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_566">I am pleased to update the House on the Nenagh castle project and I thank the Senator for bringing it to the attention of the Seanad. The Nenagh Tourism and Development Committee purchased 35-36 Pearse Street, Nenagh, including outbuildings, with the intention of demolishing them to open up a vista to Nenagh Castle from the Dublin Road approach to the castle. It was intended that opening up the vista would give the castle more visual prominence in the town and bring it back to being a focal point of the town.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">However, permission to demolish the two properties on Pearse Street was refused on appeal in 1997. Following this, consultant architects were appointed in 2000 to examine the options for the properties and the castle, in advance of public consultation regarding the future plans. They proposed an extensive scheme including visitor facilities with an estimated cost in 2002 of €1.3 million. Running costs were estimated at €130,000 to €150,000 per annum. The intention was that the facility would be run by the OPW. The castle is in State ownership and the Pearse Street properties were also transferred to State ownership in 2004. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must ensure the best value use of the resources available for our built heritage. In the present case, it is important that all stakeholders — the Nenagh community, Nenagh Town Council and the State authorities — be involved in advancing an attainable project for the castle. For example, the county manager has said that there are advanced plans to develop tourist trails both in Nenagh itself and in the north Tipperary area and that Nenagh Castle would be integral to these plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">Therefore, having regard to all the circumstances, it was considered the best solution was to ask the OPW to make recommendations for a suitable development at this site, less ambitious than that identified in the consultant architects' report, and having regard to the other issues, which have emerged concerning the castle and castle field. This has been done. I look forward to seeing the outcome of this review at an early date and I believe that the opportune time to meet with Nenagh Town Council will be when there has been an opportunity to study that review. The Minister would be open to a meeting at that stage because there would be great merit in such a meeting when we have the outcome of the review.</p>

            <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
            <p eId="para_571">I wish to ask the Minister of State to respond immediately to the many wind farmers who are unable to gain access to the national grid because of the current management and monopoly of the ESB and to clarify his responsibilities in this area. The Minister, in a parliamentary reply in the Dáil, denied responsibility for it and said it was a question for the regulator. My understanding, however, is that the regulator is a civil servant and, as such, he is responsible for the implementation of Government policy. In 2005, when the Minister was addressing the Wind Energy Association in Dundalk, he clearly indicated his involvement in Government policy and his wish to expedite such policy in the area of wind energy connections to the national grid.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">On numerous occasions over the past year many Members of this House expressed concern over continuing unexplained issues as regards access to the national grid for renewable energy, in particular wind energy. The Minister knows the considerable moneys and time that have been expended by many groups and private individuals as regards monitoring the suitability of particular planning for wind energy and also in the planning process. For many groups both of these initiatives have proven to be very expensive. All of this development took place in response to clear and unambiguous Government policy in support of wind energy. Having gained sight of the finishing line, many of the wind energy developers now find their planning permissions are running out, while those responsible for access to the grid are sitting on their hands and doing nothing to progress matters. At present approximately 2,000 MW of electricity are waiting to be connected.</p>
            <p eId="para_573">It is important to be truthful. The suspicion among many of those proposed promoters is that the ESB and its subsidiaries, which already have access to the national grid, are being given first preference. The Minister of State will be aware of the situation from Donegal down to Galway and into Kerry and west Cork that there are proposals there ahead of projects beside lines that could provide access to the national grid. In other words, the capacity is there and many promoters are looking at a national grid that is capable of taking their capacities if they were allowed to go. Other projects, however, particularly in Kerry and west Cork, that are far removed from the national grid are, nonetheless, ahead of them in terms of access. This means the others will have to wait for up to ten years for access. There is a clear indication from this that something is seriously wrong. It is very important that the Minister now takes responsibility for the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">We know that up to 90% of the electricity generated in this country is based on fossil fuels imported from outside. Some 50% of that is gas. Only a few weeks ago, because of the disruption in the Russian supply of gas through the Ukraine, there was growing fear in many of the industrialised countries that use this source of energy over what might happen in the future. Ireland depends on Britain for gas, which comes from Scotland through the pipeline, for up to 50% of its generating capacity. All of these countries were fearful as to what might happen as regards energy. There was talk in England about "dimming the lights" in homes and in Germany some classified the impending crisis as the "war of the 21st century". At the same time officials in the Department as well as in Bord Gáis were dismissing the crisis as was the regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">However, Professor John Simmie of NUI, Galway, clearly indicated his concern. He failed to understand why a country like this, so dependent on fossil fuel and particularly gas imported from Britain, could make so light of such a serious crisis. All of this is a warning sign that in the future we need to get real about access and developing wind energy, especially where it is readily available. The excess capacity is available but it is not being allowed. People are suspicious as regards the regulator because of his past association with the ESB. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the situation in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">My other request is that we prioritise connections for those proposals that are ready to go, which have ready access to the national grid nearby. It is also vitally important to consider the complete separation of the ESB from the national grid. That will allay the fears and suspicions felt by so many people.</p>

          <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_182">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_577">I thank Senator Ulick Burke for raising this issue. He asked at the outset for clarification on the position with regard to the Minister and I will do that. First, I will clarify for the House where actual responsibilities lie as regards access by wind farmers to the electricity, distribution and transmission systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">In accordance with Part V of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, on access to transmission and distribution systems, responsibility for access to the national grid, together with the subsequent costs pertaining to same, rests solely with the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. The Minister has no function in the matter. The CER gives directions to the transmission system operator, TSO, and distribution system operator, DSO, as regards grid codes, matters to be specified in the code and the terms for the connection to, and use of, the transmission and distribution networks. These are all solely matters for the CER, with the Minister having no function or power to intervene. Having stated that, I take this opportunity to advise the House on the background to the issue raised by Senator Ulick Burke and current developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">On 3 December 2003, the CER decided as an interim measure that the electricity network operators ESB and ESB Networks were not required to offer new binding connection offers for windfarms before the end of 2003. In making this decision the CER was exercising, as I have already pointed out, its exclusive competence under section 34 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. The commission was responding to concerns on the part of the grid operator about system stability and reliability if all proposed windfarms were connected. The House should be aware that the CER also has statutory responsibility for security of supply. After the moratorium announcement was made the CER established a working group representing itself, the network operators, Sustainable Energy Ireland and the Irish Wind Energy Association to address the issues and concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">In July 2004 the CER published a direction, which appeared to lift the moratorium. However, the Minister is advised by CER that a number of technical issues were unresolved which meant, in effect, that no new connection offers issued before end 2004. Following progress on the outstanding technical issues the CER issued a further direction to the system operators in December 2004. This direction mandated the operators to give immediate priority to issue connection offers to those 34 applications — referred to as "gate 1" applications — which were deemed complete by 3 December 2003, the date of the moratorium. The total capacity involved amounted to 371 MW.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">Subsequent to this the CER has been developing, in co-operation with the system operators, proposals for those grid applications still within the application process. These are termed as "gate 2" applications. The Minister is advised by the Commission for Energy Regulation that a draft decision regarding its criteria for entry to gate 2 will issue from the commission within the next fortnight. The Government is firmly committed to progressing the contribution of renewable energy sources to national electricity generating capacity. We are on track to meet our EU target of just over 13% by 2010. The private sector is playing no small part in the meeting of that target by making significant investments in wind energy and in other types of energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">In order to ensure delivery of the required new renewable energy capacity, the Minister will shortly launch a new support programme which will feature a fixed price feed-in tariff mechanism. Further prospects for the renewable energy sector as well as the institutional arrangements and market structures for the Irish electricity sector, are part of the comprehensive strategy review by Deloitte &amp; Touche. This review has just been completed and submitted to the Minister. It is currently being considered by the Department in the context of the finalisation of an energy policy consultation paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_583">Senator Ulick Burke questioned the impartiality of the commission. Both the Minister and I are satisfied there is no question of a lack of impartiality. The Commission for Energy Regulation acts in a totally impartial manner. Its only concern is to ensure that Ireland can strive to meet or hopefully surpass its EU target by 2013.</p>
