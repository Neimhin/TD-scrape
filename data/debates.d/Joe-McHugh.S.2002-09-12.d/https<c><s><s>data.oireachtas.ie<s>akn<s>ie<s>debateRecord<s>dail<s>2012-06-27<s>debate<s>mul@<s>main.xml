          <p eId="para_1">The Government established a special Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears. We have had the Keane report. There has been much soul-searching as part of the attempt to provide answers to the 118,000 people who are in significant mortgage arrears of over 90 days. The <i>Irish Examiner</i> summed up yesterday's rushed press conference very well when it referred to it as a "newsless news conference". Another columnist described it as "a very moving waste of time".</p>

          <p eId="para_5">This serious issue affects people in mortgage arrears. I would like to mention something that was not announced yesterday. It did not merit a Government press release or press conference. Last week, the Minister, Deputy Burton, commenced a statutory instrument and laid it before the House. It was buried in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. Essentially, it begins the phasing out and cutting of mortgage interest supplement, which is the most practical scheme that helps low-income families to avail of State support to keep the banks at bay and stay in their houses. Where is the social solidarity? The broken promise of burning the bondholders will get its final burial this week, when €1 billion is paid by the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">It is likely to jump again. The low-income families that have been able to avail of this scheme will no longer be in a position to do so. They will have to deal with the banks first. They will have to make payments for 12 months before they will be considered for the mortgage interest supplement scheme. The Taoiseach briefed the banks yesterday, but he would not brief this House or the public on the details of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">I want Deputy Martin to understand that the mortgage arrears sub-committee has met six times in the last six or eight weeks to push this through to a conclusion. The legislation will be published and the details will be provided on Friday. I want to make it perfectly clear that this is not about people who cannot pay - it is about people who will not pay. The lenders do not have to wait for the legislation to be implemented before they start to sit down with their customers and borrowers to work out solutions. If the banks respond to the Keane report by actually pushing through the options and facilities that will be made available to them, the need for the personal insolvency legislation to be used will be greatly diminished. The statutory instrument mentioned by Deputy Martin arises from people entering into the mortgage arrears process within the Keane report. It is for that reason that the Minister initiated the statutory instrument. That will proceed.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">The Taoiseach has another European crisis summit. In his interview in <i>The Irish Times </i>today he spent most of his time explaining why the issues affecting this State will not be raised by him. That has been his constant mantra before and after every summit he has attended. Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach if he would bring a jobs stimulus plan to this summit; the answer was "No". I asked if he had concrete proposals about how the EU structural funds should work; the answer was "No". I asked if he had explored how funds from the European Investment Bank could be used in conjunction with the National Pensions Reserve Fund to stimulate growth and jobs; the answer was "No". He stated his position: "It is not Ireland that is in focus at this time." That is his explanation for not raising these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> He also welcomed the Van Rompuy report which sets out a charter for closer EU integration on a banking, fiscal and political union. The Taoiseach must know this means more co-ordination on tax policy, even more dilution of Irish sovereignty and stronger EU involvement in State budgets. Is that not the real reason he is not bringing forward his own proposals for growth that would get our people back to work? Is it not because he supports these federal EU propositions?</p>

          <p eId="para_87">-----for the need for growth, jobs and a stimulus to drive and encourage movement in the European economies. The meetings on Thursday and Friday will deal with an increase in funding that is available from the European Investment Bank which, in turn, will leverage further moneys but it has to be made available to countries that are in vulnerable positions or those such as Ireland that are in a programme. That is the first answer, a "Yes", which Ireland will articulate very strongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Second, I refer to the approval of project bonds. This is an opportunity for flexibility to be shown by Europe in respect of these bonds which have only applied to huge intercontinental infrastructural developments such as motorways, autobahns or railroads. Project bonds would be useful for smaller countries but flexibility must be shown in that regard. That is an issue I will articulate, along with a number of other smaller countries, namely, that as part of the growth and jobs stimulus project bonds should be flexible enough to cater for smaller countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> Third, I refer to creative ways of using structural funds that remain unspent in countries. This country has spent all the structural funds that were allocated to it. Greece, for example, was allocated €16 billion which it cannot spend because of the requirement to put up moneys from a national perspective. In an overall sense, significant amounts of structural funds will not be spent. The political challenge is to find a creative way of not withdrawing money from envelopes allocated to individual countries but finding a facility whereby when money is not spent over a range of countries a creative way can be found to use it.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">Romania, for example, cannot draw down all its structural funds and there are a number of other problems in that regard. In those three areas, in respect of the growth and jobs agenda, Ireland will be very strong in articulating what is in both our interest and the interest of the eurozone. The problem, however, is the banking crisis and that is the issue for Friday's meeting. The problem we face here is that if one accepts the principle of European decision-making and sharing of liability, the corollary is also true. In Ireland's case what happened was that the direction was given from Europe and the Government lay down in front of it and accepted that the Irish people should shoulder all of that liability. That is where there needs to be change. That is the design flaw that applies within the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> As I stated in that interview, the eurozone banking crisis is holding back this and every other country. As an exporting nation we need other European economies to be thriving and getting stronger so that they will buy our goods. Europe as a whole buys from other countries around the world; it is a global situation. The real opportunity on Friday is for political leadership. Speculators and those who write and comment can say what they like. This must be a political process with a political decision that will set clarity of structure and strategy in which markets and investors can have confidence and understand the strength of and the future of the euro and the eurozone. That is a political problem that must be dealt with by political leaders. We - and I - will articulate this. I will articulate that argument very strongly on behalf of the Irish Government and the people. What was accepted in the past is the cause of the problem. The principle of acceptance of European decision making and sharing of liability was not applied in the case of this country - to our cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">I have made it clear before that we share the public's dismay at the cost of honouring the banking debts, considering the role of the banks in the economic crisis. When the Government was appointed we raised this with the ECB and with the various authorities at European level. The fact is the vast majority of Anglo Irish Bank debts were paid off by our predecessors in office. Some €15.7 billion was paid out in senior unsecured bonds since the Government of the day issued a blanket guarantee back in September 2008 and €160 million remains to be paid after this week. If one allows Anglo Irish Bank to default clearly that would create doubt over future funding being made available by the European Central Bank to Irish banks at very low interest levels and we would see a renewed flight of funds and ever tighter credit conditions being placed on potential Irish job creators. We cannot and will not have that.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> As I said to Deputy Adams on many occasions, we are not going to default, especially as we have rebuilt the reputation, trust and the confidence of this country. What we need now at political level is a political decision to deal with the eurozone banking crisis. The changes being made by Government are challenging and great credit is due to the people in accepting those changes and for the clarity of their decision, not least in the Deputy's constituency, in respect of the fiscal stability treaty. The crisis of the moment is the banking crisis within the eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> The Van Rompuy paper, referred to by Deputy Adams, is a strategy and a roadmap where growth and opportunity can be created but for me and for the other leaders, the question is what political decisions can be made on Friday in regard to the immediate crisis in the banking situation within the eurozone and to set out that pathway and strategy where confidence, trust and stability can be restored. It is important for investment into the eurozone, investment here, purchases of goods and dealing in the euro. All of those areas require political decisions and that process has to start on Friday.</p>

It is expected that Second Stage will be taken probably next week. It is not a fact that the banks must wait for the Bill to be enacted before they start dealing with their customers and their borrowers. The very fact that the legislation is being produced and published and is going through the process, is an opportunity for banks and lenders to sit down and work it through with their customers. The Bill will be published on Friday and all the details of the technicalities will be available on Friday. The Whips will make arrangements for the Second Stage to be taken probably next week. I expect a lot of interest in this Bill. We will accommodate the House by making as much time as possible available for the Second Stage debate, given the proposal for a summer recess. However, I want to see Second Stage concluded after everyone has had an opportunity to participate in the debate.</p>

Obviously arrangements must be made in respect of training and appointing personnel for the advisory service that must be provided. That is part of the process that must take place as the legislation proceeds. Parallel with that, banks and lenders now know the legislation will be published on Friday and that it will become a reality.

          <p eId="para_353">I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on the Bill the primary purpose of which is designed to close an existing loophole in our current law, but it is much more than that. What we are hoping to do will bring us all one step closer to protecting the children of Ireland. We cannot undo the harm of the past but we must put safeguards in place for future vulnerable citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> This Bill is one element of a series of legislative measures to protect children and vulnerable persons to whom our Government is committed. It has been drafted to complement the operation of both the Children First Bill and the national vetting Bill. These initiatives represent a significant development in the legislative framework governing child protection in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> Reports such as the Ryan report, the Murphy report and, more recently, the Cloyne report have given this country a litany of shocking revelations, stories and images none of us can forget. There is, therefore, a compelling argument for closing the current loophole in the law. In doing so, the Bill aims to better protect children and vulnerable adults from serious offences including sexual offences. There is no question that this Bill has big boots to fill, high expectations to meet and vulnerable citizens to protect. In short, we need to get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> There has been much comment in recent years on the horrors of institutional and clerical abuse. While I support the Bill and its intentions, I am concerned that it might criminalise families. We cannot escape the awful fact that most abuse<b>
						</b>here occurs within families. It must be recognised also that families may and do act in a self protecting way by not disclosing abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> Some truths are hard to acknowledge, but they must be all the same. Every citizen has a moral duty to report child abuse. People did not do so in the past partly due to a motivation to protect the family, and the <i>bone fide</i> interests of the family. The Bill requires the parent or guardian to act in the best <i>bone fide</i> interests of the child or vulnerable person. If we are to get that right it is crucial that this legislation clearly defines what is in the best <i>bone fide</i> interests of the child because my interpretation of it as a mother and somebody else's interpretation of it as a parent or neighbour might be entirely different. It is crucial that we clearly define it.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> In the midst of the rush to report, the interests of the child - the victim - must still be paramount. In the Bill, children under the age of 14 will have no rights in the reporting of their abuse. These children are already victims and we should not make them victims all over again. That child will have a family, and it is not in isolation that all of this must be taken into consideration when preparing the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The family could be left ostracised and stigmatised. These are issues we must confront and we must have measures in place which support rather than divide families already in a dire situation. The repercussions of reporting abuse are huge and cannot be underestimated. We need to have adequate systems and supports in place for families which may well be torn apart in the process of reporting abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> The introduction of mandatory reporting requirements within a jurisdiction tends to increase the community's awareness of child abuse. This is a good thing. However, if there are inadequate resources available, it may result in services being overwhelmed. We all have a duty to inform, but as I have already said, public opinion has been influenced by revelations of abuse and subsequent cover-ups by the likes of the Catholic Church. Understandably, this has led to a preoccupation with the matter of reporting. Whether legislating for reporting is the most sensible approach to enhancing child protection services is open to question, particularly as it has been well established in other jurisdictions that criminalising the failure to report has led to unintended outcomes. Among these is the disproportionate level of funding required to manage the intake of reports, with consequent reduction in the resources available to provide services for vulnerable children.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> There is an over-arching, positive obligation on the State to protect children from abuse, including when this abuse is carried out by private individuals. Putting in place an effective system to achieve this end requires a wide range of measures. The Office of the Ombudsman for Children has welcomed the Bill, but the Ombudsman has also made substantial recommendations with which I agree. These include that all necessary resources be put in place to ensure that social work departments can respond effectively to any increase in reporting consequent upon the general scheme; that an effective system of monitoring, for example, by the social health services inspectorate, SSI, or HIQA, is put in place to monitor the effects of the general scheme; and that an independent review of the effects on child protection practice is required to be undertaken no later than three years after implementation. This should be informed by inspection by HIQA or the SSI.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> This Bill will only be useful if it makes our children safer. An independent review would measure whether this has been achieved. It is worth noting that following the experience of its</p>
          <p eId="para_363">implementation in New South Wales, it was recently decided to remove criminal sanction for breach of the duty to report.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">At a recent seminar in Trinity College, Professor Leah Bromfield, deputy director of the Australian Centre for Child Protection at the University of South Australia, warned that Ireland should think carefully about introducing mandatory reporting. In her jurisdiction, within several years the rate of reporting had risen sixfold, overwhelming the child protection system. Fearful of being prosecuted, citizens were overloading the system with reports of suspected abuse or neglect. While only an eighth of reports were confirmed as abuse, resources were swallowed up trying to cope with the reports, at the cost of less formal social work, such as family support, that could help children. Two recommendations of the Wood inquiry in Australia were to limit the legislative reporting duty to cases of suspected significant harm and to implement a greater focus on the referral of more minor cases to community-based services.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> Such protective measures should, as appropriate, include effective procedures for the establishment of social programmes to provide necessary support for the child and for those who have the care of the child, as well as for other forms of prevention and for identification, reporting, referral, investigation, treatment and follow-up of instances of child maltreatment. The best way to streamline reporting of suspected child abuse is to restore confidence in the system by implementation of a sound management structure and investment in professional development, alongside measures to promote the notion of child protection as everyone's business.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> This Bill and the Children First guidelines are two serious steps on the way to further ensuring the protection of children in Ireland and I am sure the Oireachtas and the people of Ireland will be support them wholeheartedly. However, I would like to urge a little caution, because there is so much at stake. It is very important that we do not destroy the family in our efforts to protect the child.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanFarrell" eId="spk_333">
          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_368">As parents, our primary instinct is to protect our children, yet as a society, we fail in this time and again. I would like to acknowledge the hard work that has been put into the drafting of this Bill in order to make it fit for purpose. There is no doubt that through this legislation, along with the referendum and the collective legislation to copper fasten the protection of children that is to follow from Minister Fitzgerald, this matter has been given the unprecedented attention it so justly deserves. As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I have witnessed the extraordinary dedication that voluntary organisations such as the Rape Crisis Centre, One in Four and the ISPCC, to name but a few, give to representing in full the victims they are trying to protect. Their insight has been invaluable to the construction of this Bill. I acknowledge my respect for the work that they do and the courage of those victims who have been willing to share their story with the aim of helping others.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> We have poor historical record when it comes to protecting our children. The disbelief and anger surrounding revelations of institutional abuse is not just about the actions that took place, but about the covering up and turning a blind eye. Last week we saw a damning report of 112 children dying of unnatural causes, in tragic and lonely circumstances, during one of the wealthiest and progressive periods of our history. The Catholic Church may not have the same institutional power as formerly, but the days of turning a blind eye are not yet behind us by any means. In the past we may have underestimated the disincentives to blowing the whistle on criminal or neglectful behaviour. We now are learning - the hard way - the power of fear, uncertainty and loyalty when it comes to reporting crime in areas such as corruption, banking practice and even something as sinister as child abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> According to ISPCC research, 57% of people would be reluctant to report a crime. This gets more complicated when we delve into the reality of sexual abuse. Statistically in Ireland, it is the people that are closest to the victim, such as family, friends or the people placed in positions of moral guardianship, who are the perpetrators. Ultimately, these are also the silent accommodators of child abuse. These are the people we trust the most with our children, family, friends, and professionals. These are the people most difficult to suspect or even question. Some 80% of abuse takes place within the close family and friend circle of the child. The aim of this Bill is to identify the obligation for those who may be struggling with the concept of reporting or of identifying a loved one as a victim. This Bill ensures that it is a crime not to. This is the only way to ensure that the welfare of the child or vulnerable person, and other children who may be subject to abuse by the offender, is put first and foremost.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> Children and vulnerable persons do not have the means to report a crime on their own and must rely on others. Their only hope is to be saved or protected by a suspecting adult who will step forward and report the abuse. While one may argue that turning someone into a criminal for not reporting someone, due to fear, confusion or loyalty may be a step too far, the child must come first and there is no alternative or excuse. This Bill clearly acknowledges the power of authority,the institution and self-protection as barriers to doing the right thing. It creates an incentive that goes beyond the moral incentive. There will now be a legal duty on each and every person in society, not just the professionals, to ensure that the facilitation of abuse will not be tolerated. It will no longer be someone else's problem. It will be their problem and our problem. Looking the other way will no longer be the easy option. Failure to report will now be a criminal offence. </p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_39">One of the main findings of the justice committee was that there was much comment on institutional abuse whereas much abuse is inter-familial. For this reason we recommended that the legislation should strike a balance between confidentiality and the risk to children and vulnerable adults, in other words, we should tread carefully. I acknowledge that there has been debate about the legislation in respect of reasonable excuse and the choice of the victim not to report. In an ideal world all excuses would be outlined before the Bill is published.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_40"> I echo Deputy Regina Doherty's call on the Minister to continually review the impact of the Bill with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and to continue dialogue with organisations such as One in Four, on which we rely to give real insight into the incidence and reality of abuse of children and vulnerable adults. We must be vigilant in the implementation and review of this legislation to ensure that, along with the upcoming children's rights Bill, the vetting Bill and the children's referendum, it serves its vital purpose, that is, to protect our most vulnerable.</summary>
        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_334">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_372">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. A society can progress only if it is prepared to learn from past mistakes. One of our society's gravest mistakes was the creation and maintenance of a culture of secrecy and undue deference. This contributed to the shameful abuse and exploitation of thousands of young and vulnerable citizens in communities and residential institutions. The abuse and exploitation was brought to light by some survivors who spoke out courageously against the prevailing silence. Their bravery led to the statutory inquiries which culminated in the Ryan and Murphy reports. Although long overdue, these reports have firmly recorded the shameful secrets of our country's past. Only last week we heard of certain failures in our recent past. Anyway, these reports must be accompanied by positive action.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> The Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill is one element of the positive action needed. I welcome the provisions, which will enhance the protection of children in Ireland. The preparation of the Bill has included public consultation and a call for submissions from public and civil society organisations. Civil society organisations can provide invaluable assistance and insight into a range of areas to an extent simply not possible by public representatives because of other duties and tasks. Without doubt the Bill is richer and more comprehensive in outlining and achieving its objectives because of the contributions made by the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, Barnardos, One in Four, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> The regulatory impact analysis was important as well. It recommended independently that we need stand-alone statutory provisions to ensure a greater focus on effective protection of children and other vulnerable persons from serious crime. The Bill recognises the responsibility of communities to safeguard children. It does so by placing a duty on all citizens to report to An Garda Síochána any case of actual knowledge or a strong belief of an arrestable offence. Arrestable offences are listed in detail in the Bill. The distinction between actual knowledge or belief of an offence as opposed to mere suspicion or rumour is crucial because the reporting of false accusations can have detrimental effects on a person wrongly accused. I cannot think of a worse situation than for an innocent person to be wrongly accused of the crimes with which this Bill deals. The legislation lists in detail the defences on which a person may rely for not disclosing information. These defences are clear and straightforward. They respect the wishes of a victim of serious crimes provided he or she possess the capacity to make informed decisions. Special provision exists for designated professionals, including medical practitioners and social workers, as well as for parents and guardians. These provisions contain the important qualification that all decisions must be taken with the interests and welfare of the vulnerable person or child.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> The former chairman of One in Four and current executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, Colm O’Gorman, who is a survivor of abuse, has recalled how the trauma he experienced was exacerbated by the realisation that people in the community knew of the abuse and even joked about it, but failed utterly to act responsibly and compassionately by reporting their knowledge to An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> It is regrettable that the debate on the Bill has concentrated on the Catholic sacrament of confession and whether confessional privilege should apply. It is a complex matter of a personal and moral nature and one on which many views can be held. It should be accepted by all citizens, however, of all religions and none that this legislation is first and foremost about protecting children. This is not about singling out a particular religion and it shameful that some commentators have ignored the substantial provisions and focused instead on a populist, inaccurate angle.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> It is worthwhile to consider the important work of the Rape Crisis Network Ireland. It has shown that almost 80% of childhood abuse victims have been abused by someone known to them. The State cannot and will not permit a situation whereby adults, especially those in positions of responsibility, are aware of criminal acts, in particular those of a sexual nature or those against children or vulnerable people, but choose to do nothing. Such an eventuality makes manifest the essence of the remark attributed to Irishman, Edmund Burke: "All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_378">I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, on introducing the Bill. The Bill is important and my party supports it. It will help to ensure proper protection in the State for children and vulnerable adults. It is being introduced along with the children first Bill, which puts the Children First guidelines on a statutory footing. The thrust of both Bills will enhance our child protection system.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> I commend the Minister on the process by which the Bill was taken before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. Oireachtas Members and committee members have been able to scrutinise the details. Organisations with an interest and a contribution to make have been afforded the opportunity to present their views on where they believe the legislation should be altered or tweaked to ensure that when it is ultimately passed by the Houses, it will ensure the best possible outcomes and safeguards, it will ensure children and vulnerable people are protected and it will ensure that the public is clear on the onus to come forward with any information they may have relating to serious offences and that it is simply not acceptable for someone not to do so. Such inaction is punishable if a person fails in his duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> The similar process taken at the Joint Committee on Health and Children of scrutinising the Children First Bill has been useful and productive. It will lead to that legislation being much improved when it comes before the House. This Bill deals with arrestable and prosecutable offences and any information relating specifically to offences of this nature. The children first Bill deals with a wider range of issues, especially those affecting the well-being of children. In particular it deals with the necessity for those in positions of responsibility, either in a professional or voluntary capacity and who are in contact with children and responsible for safeguarding them, to pass on any concerns they may have in respect of the well-being of a child where they believe the welfare of that child may not be secure.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> Following the committee discussions, the Minister introduced a reasonable defence clause. Ultimately, this will be for the courts to decide. This provision was the result of contributions made earlier. The reasonable defence clause relates to serious offences. Although this has been taken on board in the Bill it is something which arises only in the most grave and exceptional of circumstances and when someone does not report something as serious as one of the offences listed.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The Bill deals with that as best it can. Whether in respect of information on serious offences or child protection and welfare issues, appropriate action must be taken in the interest of the child. We cannot return to the situation of the past whereby too many people believed it was not their responsibility to play a part in ensuring children's well-being was protected by those who were looking after them. This Bill and the Children First Bill 2012, the heads of which are being considered by the Joint Committee on Health and Children, will bolster the child protection and welfare services of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> However, in conjunction with ensuring issues are reported to the appropriate authorities, we must also properly equip the agencies of the State to deal with vulnerable children in their care. The report on the deaths of children while in the care of the State produced by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon and Ms Norah Gibbons of Barnardos found that 112 of the 196 deaths which occurred between 2000 and 2010 were from unnatural causes. The report further found that many of the children who died of natural causes were not being provided with an adequate level of protection and care. That was a failure on the part of the State which was not related to the reporting of issues or of the children coming to its attention. All of these children were known to the State and were either in care or interacting with the HSE. In many instances the level of service and effort provided was insufficient to address the needs of these particularly vulnerable children.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> By the time a child enters the care of the State he or she will already experienced extreme difficulties. In many cases they have high levels of need and they require a wide range of services in order to undo the damage they have suffered and to give them a viable pathway to adult life or a second chance at a happy childhood. In addressing the Bill before us and, more particularly, the children first Bill, we must ensure State services meet the needs of children who are brought to the attention of the HSE or the new child and family support agency by reports from professionals and members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> People who deal with children should take a level of responsibility that is appropriate to their position so that issues are not escalated prematurely or in a way that is not in the best interest of the child concerned. We should be careful in introducing the criminal sanction aspects of the children first Bill to ensure that all cases where children do not receive adequate care are reported without creating an excessive burden on services. When reports are escalated at a very early stage it can allow people to avoid their own responsibilities. The Joint Committee on Health and Children has heard from a number of organisations on this subject. At our meeting yesterday representatives of the teaching unions expressed concern that criminal sanctions in the absence of adequate training could lead to a situation in which everything is immediately reported to the HSE. That would create the danger of drawing resources into the HSE to the detriment of providing services for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> In many cases the social worker has the primary responsibility for dealing with calls and reports. Social worker numbers have come under significant pressure and since the start of last year the number of children in the care of the State with assigned workers has decreased from 94% to 91.9%. This points to the need for the Government to recruit additional social workers and adequately resource our child protection system. It is critical that every child in the care of the State is given a written care plan and assigned a social worker who can act as a contact point. We are not yet at that stage, however. </p>
          <p eId="para_387"> It is important that the views expressed by the organisations who discussed the Children First Bill with the Joint Committee on Health and Children are taken into account if we are to ensure children are protected and that reports are passed onto the State. No child should be endangered by a lack of legislation or guidance on how the public and the State should react to child protection and welfare issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">We must ensure that, along with legislation, we put in place the resources so that children get the treatment and services they deserve when they come to the attention of the State. I urge the Minister and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to reinstate the exemption for social workers from the Civil Service recruitment embargo. The exemption was in place until recently. Responsibility has been devolved to HSE, which makes calls as it sees appropriate. We need to ring-fence all social work positions in child and family services and allow no slippage from that number. We should also increase the number. The Government has devolved responsibility to the HSE and has not taken the position that we must ring-fence the number of positions and replace staff. Maternity and temporary positions are not being filled, which has led to slippage with regard to the number of children in State care with an assigned social worker. It is important that the number of social workers is increased. It goes hand-in-hand with reforming our child protection and welfare service.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> We will need to see that, through the establishment of the new child and family support agency at the start of next year, weaknesses in the system highlighted by several reports have been learned from so that this is a new departure. The new agency should have responsibility for services for children so that it becomes a child and family welfare and support agency rather than a child protection agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> I assure the Minister of my party's support. Since the Bill was announced, coverage has focused on the narrow issue of sacerdotal privilege. The Minister noted the media obsession on this point and the genesis of the coverage goes back to the initial presentation of the Bill and the publication of the proposals for the Bill. This is a balanced and important Bill. It is important legislation in combination with the children first legislation. I forward to making a contribution to the children first legislation to ensure we have a child protection and welfare service in this country that looks after our children and ensures those who need support and services from the State receive them. This will ensure that we do not fail them, as happened in too many cases in the past.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_391">I propose to share time with Deputy Buttimer. This is very important legislation and I welcome the priority given to it by the Minister for Justice and Equality. I specifically welcome the manner in which the Minister has framed the legislation. The Bill has been the subject of a regulatory impact analysis. The draft scheme of the legislation was discussed at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. The hearings at the joint committee included oral presentations from One in Four, the rape crisis centre and the CARI Foundation, together with written presentations. It is most encouraging that the Bill includes provisions to take account of the issues raised by the joint committee during the course of its deliberations. The Minister chose to introduce the Bill in the Seanad last May and, having read the transcript of the initial debate on its content, this was a worthy exercise as the legislation moves through the relevant processes. We are often criticised for not introducing reforms. The way the Minister presented this Bill in the Oireachtas shows a different approach and will lead to better legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> The Bill criminalises the withholding of information on certain arrestable offences against children and vulnerable adults. It aims to protect children and vulnerable adults from serious offences including sexual offences. This Bill, together with the children first Bill and the national vetting bureau Bill, will strengthen child protective legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> The central point of the Bill is to place a duty on people - not just health professionals or others working with children - to report certain specified arrestable offences to the Garda Síochána. It has been broadly welcomed by a cross-section of organisations working with children. The external debate during the framing and initial presentation of the legislation wrongly centred exclusively on the seal of the confession. When we deal with this subject as law makers, there is the potential to miss more important core issues and nuances when the entire discussion zones in on a specific aspect of the proposed legislation. I am happy the Minister dealt with that specific issue in how he outlined the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> Before the publication last week of the State's role in protecting children in its care, media attention and the general debate on child abuse focused on abuse by the clergy. National statistics from the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI, show that nearly 80% of childhood sexual abuse victims were abused by someone known to them, such as immediate family members, relatives or family friends. Some 12% were abused by those in authority, such as teachers, coaches or priests. We have a shameful past in Ireland with regard to the abuse of children and, like the vast majority of Irish people, I am instinctively in favour of mandatory reporting. That is not to say this legislation will be a panacea.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> I welcome the sections of the Bill dealing with vulnerable adults. In recent times shock revelations have emerged about abuse of the elderly in a number of nursing homes. Many victims of abuse are severely traumatised by the abuse. While prevention of abuse to others is important, it is also critically important that we do not criminalise victims. The Minister outlined the fact that this legislation closes a loophole in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, whereby it was deemed an offence to withhold information in respect of a serious criminal offence. However, that provision of the 1998 Act specifically excluded sexual offences. I understand the urgency of the 1998 Act following the Omagh atrocity. The offence of withholding information was effectively abolished in Irish law when the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours was abolished by section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> A general duty to inform no longer existed in Irish law. Oireachtas debates from this time show an awareness that the abolition of this offence would mean it would no longer be a crime to fail to report child abuse. However, it appears from the debates in 1996 that it was expected that some form of mandatory reporting of child abuse would be put on a statutory footing in the near future. It has taken 16 years for this to happen, which is a terrible indictment of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> However, this legislation is a step in the right direction. The Bills digest produced by the Oireachtas Library includes in its appendix recommendations from the report by the Garda Inspectorate entitled Responding to Child Sexual Abuse. These 29 recommendations offer a criminal offence perspective and neatly encompass the current shortcomings in the system and the difficulties that may arise in the future. If properly implemented, they will help to ensure better outcomes. This Bill and the Children First Bill will facilitate an enhanced appreciation by society at large of the deep problems of child abuse. These and other initiatives will allow us to begin to move away from our shameful past.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_337">
          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_398">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, to the House and compliment him and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on their ongoing efforts to safeguard children and other vulnerable individuals in our society. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, indicated in his opening statement that the primary purpose of this Bill is to close an existing loophole in the law. There is something in the Irish psyche that tends to embrace loopholes and seek to obfuscate and abdicate responsibility in certain areas. I am glad we now have a Minister for Justice and Equality and a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs who are committed to ensuring that we do as we have said we will do, namely, safeguard the well-being and welfare of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> As other speakers observed, we have had a litany of reports in recent years illustrating a legacy in the area of care for children and vulnerable adults of shameful neglect, abdication of responsibility, betrayal and a failure of accountability on the part of the State, the church and individuals. The publication last week of the report on the deaths of children in care highlighted the State's failure to protect these most vulnerable of children. This Bill is not about a particular setting or institution but encompasses institutional abuse, clerical abuse and abuse within the family. As other speakers have pointed out, the majority of abuse takes place in the home. It is vital that we have a joined-up approach to child protection. This Bill joins the Children First Bill and the legislation on vetting and will be followed, hopefully in October or November, by a referendum on children's rights. That referendum is about protecting those most in need of our protection. The 1916 Proclamation pledged to cherish all of the children of the nation equally. As Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, one of the authors of last week's report, observed, the Constitution must not be a barrier to State intervention to protect children. Rather, it should include an obligation on the State to aid and assist those children and vulnerable adults most in need of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> This debate should not be confined to this Chamber but must also take place across the wider society, in the living rooms, kitchens and dining rooms of every house in the country. If the Minister, Deputy Shatter, leaves office without achieving anything other than his work in the area of child welfare and protection, he will have done a very good day's work. As Deputy Joe Carey observed, for 16 years or more we have had a complete abdication of responsibility. In the Chamber this morning the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party reminded us once again of his own failure to act when in government. We must, as a society, look back in order fully to understand the deficiencies in the system, while also looking forward with a determination to put in place systems that adequately protect children and vulnerable adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> In 1996, the then Government undertook to place the mandatory reporting of child abuse on a statutory footing. It is only now, in 2012, that the necessary actions are being taken to ensure that level of protection is in place. As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I have been overseeing the scrutiny of the draft heads of the Children First Bill for the past two months. I pay tribute to the delegates who have attended committee meetings, the agencies who have offered submissions, both oral and written, and the committee members for their work in analysing all of the information. Our report on these hearings will be published tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> The Bill before us today creates a criminal offence of withholding information in regard to serious offences committed against children and vulnerable adults. It places an obligation on persons who have knowledge of or belief that such a crime has been committed to report it to the Garda. The Bill does not, however, require a person to report or submit a suspicion - there must be knowledge or belief. I welcome the defences contained in the Bill to protect those who act in the best interests of children and vulnerable adults. Those of us involved in the care and education of children and vulnerable adults are well aware that one size does not fit all. In this regard, I welcome the provision that where a victim of abuse is over the age of 14 and has sufficient capacity, deference must be given to his or her request that information is not passed on to the Garda. I also welcome the inclusion of a defence where a parent, guardian or designated professional does not disclose information in the belied that he or she was acting in the interest of the health and well-being of the child or vulnerable person.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> As part of my preparations for the committee's scrutiny of the heads of the Children First Bill, I have spoken at length to representatives of the Samaritans. They make a number of interesting observations regarding their work, not least of which is that most of their interactions take place by way of their 24-hour telephone helpline. I understand this amounted to some 1,069 listening hours per week for 2011, with similar volumes of calls expected this year. The vast majority of these contacts are anonymous. I urge the Minister to take on board the views expressed by the Samaritans. The confidential helpline affords callers a safe space in which to express their fears and concerns. As such, the value of reporting certain conversations may be outweighed by the support counsellors can offer to the caller. It is vital that the provisions of this Bill do not impinge in any negative way on the work of the Samaritans. I hope that will not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> The Government, led by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is delivering on its reform agenda in regard to the welfare and safety of children. This Bill is part of a suite of measures that will culminate in the referendum on children's rights. That referendum should be held in the autumn and must be a standalone ballot. In the lead-up to the vote, there will undoubtedly be some who seek to enter into side debates on other issues. We must get the message out that this is about protecting children, first, second and last. That is the task we have been given as Members of this House, of all parties and none.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> The Government is taking a three-pronged approach to put in place a child protection system that delivers for children, families and society. In its approach to this Bill and the Children First Bill, the Government has been very open in encouraging consultation and debate. The Children First proposals have been scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, while the heads of the Bill we are discussing today were debated by the Joint Committee on Health and Children. That process has allowed for a strong level of public consultation and engagement, with findings being fed back to the relevant Ministers. As I said, the health committee concluded its public deliberations on the heads of the Children First Bill yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">In addition, we received many written submissions from interested parties. Those submissions were wide-ranging, in-depth, interesting, thought-provoking and challenging. They came from people who wanted to participate and express their viewpoints. That demonstrates that this legislation places a value on the role of the child in society. It also shows that we are all equal, from the vulnerable most in need of the State's help to those who charged with the responsibility of care. If we learned nothing else last week, it was that there can be no further reneguing on responsibility and accountability. </p>
          <p eId="para_407"> The new child and family support agency heralds a new beginning with a new code of ethics, responsibility and morality regarding the care of children. In developing this legislation we have listened and are open to suggestions. We must ensure that we are consistent in our approach and definitions. Having different definitions of vulnerable people in various pieces of legislation can lead to confusion. Where possible, therefore, we should try to use the same definition and language, although I accept that it may not always be possible to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The Bill defines a vulnerable person as someone suffering from a disorder of the mind, who has an intellectual disability, or is suffering from an enduring physical impairment or injury which is of such a nature or degree as to severely restrict the capacity of a child to guard himself or herself against serious exploitation or abuse. The Bill touches on the issue of capacity, which is a complex area where our laws still rely on outdated and arcane rules. Comprehensive reform of our capacity legislation is required, which will benefit the most vulnerable people as well as their families and those who care for them. We should have a scheme which acknowledges that there are varying degrees of capacity, in order to facilitate people in making their own decisions, while recognising that in some instances people need support in taking decisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I am pleased to have had an opportunity to speak on this Bill. As I mentioned earlier, I chaired the Committee on Health and Children that dealt with the heads of the Children First legislation. This Bill is significant and I hope it will attract cross-party support, thus showing that we all take seriously our responsibilities regarding the protection of children.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_338">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_410">I wish to join with my Sinn Féin colleagues in welcoming this Bill. The legislation before us, together with the Children’s Bill and the National Vetting Bureau Bill, shows a shift in attitude towards the protection of children and other vulnerable citizens. I heartily welcome that, but I would like to restate my colleague Deputy Jonathan O’Brien’s concerns that these pieces of legislation must complement one another. All legislation enacted to protect affected vulnerable adults must be in line with the provisions of new mental capacity legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_411"> It is important to state outright that mandatory reporting is a good thing. Concerns regarding resources are not a sufficient excuse for turning a blind eye to situations where children and vulnerable adults are being harmed or are in danger of harm. The State must ensure that children are protected and that anybody who knows a child is being abused has a responsibility, under the terms of the legislation, to make a report. While the sheer scale of historical institutional abuse may never happen again, our goal must be to put in place every measure necessary to protect all of our children in every situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Legislation is important but it will not of itself protect children and vulnerable adults without vigorous support services being in place. This is where my uncertainty creeps in. To be frank, I simply do not have confidence in the Government’s ability to properly resource support services. Any family who has endured the tragic experience of having to support a child through the legal quagmire of an abuse case - particularly one taken by the State - will tell of the delays in obtaining those necessary supports. Children can often wait months to receive the necessary counselling and physiological support. Parents or guardians trying to cope with such a revelation - as well as dealing with gardaí and the DPP's office, while struggling with their own heartache - receive no counselling at all. The gardaí dealing with their case are often the only support that families receive. It can take up to two years for a straightforward case to reach the courts. Once families get to court, there are little or no supports, bar the great work done by voluntary services. A case can take up to a week in the criminal court. I am sure any Deputy who has supported a family through such a case from beginning to end will say it is a truly traumatic experience for young victims and their families, most of whom have never seen the inside of a courtroom before.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> Robust legislation is unquestionably the foundation of child protection, but the necessary support services are the scaffolding upon which real protection is built and sustained. This legislation is an acknowledgement by the State that the decades of horrific abuse experienced by our children will not be tolerated again. It is a clear line in the sand. It is a marker that states the culture of silence that colluded with those who ran State institutions, overseeing violent abuse of our children, is no longer acceptable in Irish society. We are all responsible for our country’s children who must be protected and cherished at every turn. I support Deputy Buttimer's remarks that the referendum on the rights of the child must go ahead in the autumn. It should be a stand-alone item and the wording of that referendum must be comprehensive and robust.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> We cannot talk about the future protection of children and vulnerable adults without highlighting the failure of the Government to redress the wrongs of the past. The Government has been<i> in situ</i> for 16 months. For years in opposition, they correctly berated Fianna Fáil-led governments for failing to provide redress to the surviving women and children of the Magdalene laundries and Bethany Home. Fine Gael and Labour Party Deputies, some of whom now sit at the Cabinet table, were in no doubt about State involvement in both institutions. They were unequivocal in their demand for an apology and redress for these survivors whose lives were forever framed by the abuse of those who were entrusted with their care. Yet, now that they are in Government and perfectly placed to right this wrong, the very same public representatives sit on their hands. They have hidden behind an unnecessary committee charged with investigating what we already know and can prove. They refuse to acknowledge the survivors of the Bethany Home and Magdalene laundries.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> The men and women who survived do not have time on their side. They are elderly and many of them have serious health problems. They need closure. They need the State, through the Government, to step up and acknowledge its wrongdoing. They need the people of Ireland to know that their incarceration in these institutions was not their fault. Survivors must have all of this but, critically, they need support. The State still continues to refuse pension supports due to the Magdalene women after many years of work in those laundries. It is a sad irony that Government Departments of the past used these laundries.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Yet, Departments today refuse to pay pensions due to these women. Survivors need urgent access to health care. Many of them suffer serious illnesses directly attributable to the abuse they endured in these institutions. Some 219 children, who died in Bethany Home between 1922 and 1949, lie in an unmarked grave in Mount Jerome Cemetery in Harold's Cross.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> In 1939, the Government's Deputy Chief Medical Officer refuted damning public and health inspectorate concerns in regard to the standards of care at Bethany Home on the basis of a barbaric belief that it was normal for children of unmarried mothers to suffer from starvation. While no action was taken by the Government to protect the children in Bethany Home, which was a Protestant run home, the State did force the home to cease admitting Catholic mothers and babies. What does that say about the State, its orientation and actions?</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Let us not forget the State has already accepted that there was abuse in the Magdalene laundries. This abuse is starkly documented in the Ryan report published in 2009 and in the heartbreaking detail of survivor testimonies collected by the Justice for Magdalene Group. The Ryan report and these testimonies recount that women's labour in the Magdalene laundries was forced and wholly unpaid, working conditions were harsh and women were completely deprived of their liberty, many of them of their children, and suffered physical and horrendous emotional abuse. Yet, this Government, like the previous Government, refuses to accept its and our responsibility for this abuse. Ministers continue to deny their responsibility to the women and children of Bethany Home and the Magdalene laundries. This refusal cannot and must not continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> I believe the Government wishes to the right things in respect of child protection. Sinn Féin will support it every step of the way, when the right things are being done. In addressing the welfare and protection of our children now and into the future, we must make amends to those children and women, many of them young at the time, who were so deprived, brutalised and wronged by our State and who, by they Catholic or Protestant, now need an acknowledgement and apology from this State which had a duty care to each and every one of them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ciara Conway<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_420">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on this important legislation. On Deputy McDonald's point in regard to the Magdalene Laundries, I do not believe anybody denies the truth in terms of the horrific stories we have heard of the conditions endured by the women and children involved. However, we await publication of Senator McAleese's report on this matter. I have worked and continue to work, along with Ms Sally Mulready, who is based in London and was recently appointed to the Council of State by President Higgins, with these women. Ms Mulready has also referred to how time is not on their sides and how beneficial the process with Senator McAleese, whom I know met with them in London some weeks ago, is to them. </p>
          <p eId="para_421"> This Bill places a duty on all people and not only health professionals, as was the case in the past, who are working with children to report certain specified arrestable offences to the Garda Síochána. Child protection is everybody's concern. It has been easy in the past to scapegoat particular organisations or individuals in this regard. We are now for the first time taking a cross-departmental approach to the issue of child protection. Deputy Buttimer, Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, referred to the prolonged period of interaction that has taken place with various stakeholders on the heads of the Children First Bill. For the first time ever an interdepartmental group appeared before that committee to report progress in Departments in terms of the steps being taken to ensure child protection is being adequately and efficiently dealt with. While this should have been done in the past, we were bereft of legislation in this area in respect of which we had only empty promises and rhetoric from previous Administrations.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> This Government has been in office for 16 months now. There is now a stand-alone Ministry with its own budget in this area; three significant pieces of legislation, including the Garda Vetting Bill, the heads of the Children First Bill and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable People) Bill 2012, have come before us; for the first time since the foundation of this State a handbook for social workers in terms of practice has been published and HIQA has published standards on child protection services. These are services which people would have assumed were in place but were not, leading to us being presented with a plethora of reports on child abuse, including the Murphy, Ryan and Cloyne reports, all of which were shocking and sickening and which detailed horrific abuse of children, something none of us in this House wishes to see happen ever again.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> As I stated, these reports focused heavily on abuse committed by members of the clergy. This is a key area of concern although, as others have said, we know abuse can occur anywhere. The focus of the debate on this legislation has been around the confessional seal, which disturbs me. How many disclosures were made in the kitchens of bishops palaces or in the sculleries of the parish priest's house where no confessional seal was in place yet they failed to take action or to take responsibility for or to support and protect young people and children in our State against whom some of the most horrific crimes had been committed? In my view, this legislation will address that issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_424"> People speak about the need for the voice of the child to be provided for in legislation and policy yet, we hear adults speak of their discomfort about having to make a disclosure or report. What about the child's discomfort? Where is the child's horrific experience to be voiced if adults will not step forward and take up their responsibility to protect children and vulnerable people? </p>
          <p eId="para_425"> There has been much focus on child protection. It should not be forgotten that there are 370 and 4,000 residential beds in this country for children and adults, respectively, with intellectual disability yet we have no method of monitoring what goes on in these institutions. If history has taught us anything it is, unfortunately, that people who seek to abuse others focus on areas where vulnerable people are present. I welcome this legislation and all the other legislation on the protection of children which has been brought before this House. However, there are still loopholes in our law in this regard. We have much work to do in terms of protecting vulnerable people. We must put in place criteria and standards for residential institutions to which people with intellectual and physical disability often go for respite or full time care. It is incumbent on us to pursue this.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> This is the first occasion I have had an opportunity to speak in the House since publication of the death of children in care report.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I worked as a social worker on the front line in the period from 2000 to 2010 and I have experience of being that social worker who fought for expenses to send flowers to a child's funeral. I hope now more than ever that we will see child protection services taken away from what we know to be a very dysfunctional HSE system. I have great confidence in the Minister's vision for the new child protection and family agency. I was pleased to see an additional subhead in the budget to ensure the agency will be appropriately staffed and will be able to implement and do the type of work we need it to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Atrocities happen when good people fail to act. The legislation will bring this to the fore in people's minds. We know people out there know what is going on, but for some reason they feel they cannot come forward. The Bill will compel people to do this and we do not have to make any apology for implementing such badly needed legislation. The onus will be put on people who have knowledge of a crime to voice their suspicions and make known their concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> The motto of Barnardos is that every childhood lasts a lifetime, and this is very true. We can see the early childhood experience of those children who suffered abuse in the past in State care or who were resident in Magdalen laundries followed them through their lives. It is also reflected in those we see in Mountjoy. It is no coincidence that a high proportion of those in care end up homeless and, because of the cruel and distressing life people lead on the street, turn to crime and end up in prison. Much analysis and research has shown the experience of children from birth to the age of five has a lifelong and lasting impact on their social, emotional and physical development.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> I welcome that the Minister has brought forward this legislation and that he is working with his Cabinet colleagues, in particular the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, to ensure we have a proactive approach from now on with regard to intervening with children who come to the attention of social services at the earliest possible stage. We know this is in the best interests of the child, the family and the parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> With regard to the referendum on children's rights there is much discussion about what day of the week a referendum is held. If we are to have the fullest participation on such an important matter, and to ensure the participation of young people who may be away at college or university or attending training, we should hold this referendum on a Saturday. I have asked the Minister about this previously and I hope he will bring it back to his Cabinet colleagues. Let us show people how serious we are about ensuring everybody has their say on such an important issue. We should consider this. It would also signify the importance we place on the rights of children. We should stop the rhetoric on the voice of the child and give an opportunity to engage on this issue to those close to childhood, at the age of 18, who are the most likely to be away from home.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The rights of the child and the protection of our children and vulnerable must take precedent. By protecting people who are vulnerable or who may have an intellectual or physical disability we are responding to the duty of care incumbent on all of us and supporting what can only be described as a basic human right. By protecting our children we protect all our futures.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill which is a welcome addition to the Statute Book. I am fortunate that on my travels throughout my constituency comprising Louth and east Meath the issue of sexual offences against children arose on very few occasions. This is despite the fact that Louth boasts two large urban population centres, in Dundalk and Drogheda.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> The purpose of the legislation is to close an existing loophole in the law. Under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 it is an offence to withhold information in respect of a serious criminal offence. However, this provision of the 1998 Act specifically excludes sexual offences. Therefore, the Minister is bringing forward the Bill to ensure there is an obligation on persons who have knowledge of all serious offences, including sexual offences against children or vulnerable adults, to inform the Garda Síochána. I think it is fair to assume that all Members would support such a motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> Recent reports such as Cloyne, Murphy and Ryan highlighted a litany of revelations concerning the sexual abuse of children and failure to respond to this abuse. It is clear from these revelations and the various published reports, that if those who had knowledge in the past of sexual offences committed against children had informed the Garda, many children who subsequently became the victims of abuse may have been protected from clerical sexual predators. Therefore, a compelling argument exists for closing the current loophole in the law and I reiterate that all right-minded people should support such a motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> As Members are aware, the problem is not confined to offences against children, with a number of equally serious cases of vulnerable adults in institutional care being subject to serious sexual and physical abuse. These incidents should not be tolerated. It is very important that the Government produces legislation that affords protection from abuse to children or vulnerable persons in any scenario or location. This is what this Bill is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> Under the provisions of the Bill it will be an offence to fail to disclose to the Garda Síochána, without reasonable excuse, information concerning certain serious criminal offences where such offences are committed against a child or vulnerable adult. These serious offences are listed in the Schedules to the Bill and all carry a penalty of imprisonment lasting five years or more. They include most sexual offences and offences such as assault causing harm or serious harm, cruelty to a child, the abduction of a child, manslaughter and murder. The Bill also establishes some limited defences for those charged under the Bill for persons such as a parent, guardian or medical professional acting in the interests of the health and well-being of the child or vulnerable person.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> Members are aware the Bill is one element of a series of legislative measures to protect children and vulnerable persons to which the Government is committed. The Bill has been drafted to compliment the operation of the upcoming Children First Bill and the national vetting bureau Bill. The Bill addresses the role of the Garda Síochána. It requires that any person who has evidence that a person has committed a serious offence against a child or vulnerable person must provide the Garda with that information so the Garda can investigate the alleged crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> I welcome the Bill. It strengthens the current legislation and closes a loophole that has existed for far too long. It is good legislation and should help to ensure that abuses are always reported to the appropriate authorities. I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">The frequency and source of the denials associated with child abuse in Ireland, as we have all said, is nothing short of a national shame. The Bill is long overdue. It is a small start to ensuring what happened will not happen again. It is a pity the law cannot be made retrospective with regard to those who withheld information concerning sexual offences in the past, particularly in the wake of the Ferns, Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports and the systematic abuse of thousands of vulnerable children in State and Church run institutions. The legislation is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> I also welcome the assurances given by the Minister that there will be no ambiguity when it comes to the seal of the confessional. Sacerdotal privilege has quite an uncertain status in contemporary Irish law and there must be no instance in any attempted criminal prosecution where a member of the clergy can use this privilege as a defence for failing to disclose the information in question. Some have already indicated, as the Minister is well aware, that they may very well do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">We have to send and copperfasten a clear message in this Bill to the effect that it will not be allowed to happen. Any measures aimed at strengthening child protection in this country are to be applauded. Many voluntary and sporting organisations throughout the country are working hard to implement the Children First guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I find it a little disingenuous on the part of the Government that it is pushing ahead with child protection legislation at a time when hundreds of highly vulnerable children throughout the country do not receive call-backs from front-line child protection agencies because they have heavy caseloads and are under-staffed as a result of unofficial recruitment bans. The case of a child in my constituency who was abused between the ages of 13 and 17 made the headlines last week. The case was brought to the attention of the Garda Síochána and the health services. I spoke to gardaí about the matter. It is appalling and unacceptable that as of last week, the child had yet to be contacted by the health authority. As I said earlier when I welcomed this Bill, it will be of no value if we do not strengthen the services associated with child abuse to make sure every child in the State who is abused receives an immediate, quick and efficient response from the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> The HSE has acknowledged that there are glaring gaps in child protection services. I am concerned that as a result of this legislation, social work teams will be overwhelmed with cases of potential abuse that will be referred to them from the Garda and will not have the resources to deal with them. It is beyond me to understand how the current system, which is already allowing vulnerable children to slip through the cracks, as in the case in my constituency that I mentioned, can be expected to cope with what will happen in the future. I have spoken to many gardaí who are having to act as social workers by doing call-backs to vulnerable children who are tormented as a result of physical and sexual abuse. Many such children are not being contacted by our social services. I appeal to the Minister to think carefully about that. I am not being critical of him.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> I welcome this Bill and I am pleased it is being passed. We will support it. I know I am kicking at an open door when I say, as I have said three times already, that we need to deal with cases like that of the child in Waterford who up to last week had not been contacted by the social services. I am keen to reiterate this point on the record. It has been acknowledged by gardaí that what is said to have happened to this child actually happened. The child's family are aware of it too. It is appalling that such cases are allowed to happen. In welcoming the Bill, I emphasise that we need to make sure children who have been abused in the past, who are being abused at present or who will be abused in the future are contacted by the health services immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> The latest official figures indicate there is a high level of inaccuracy in the reporting of child abuse cases. Up to half of the 20,000 to 30,000 cases of suspected child abuse that are reported in a single year tend to be reclassified as child welfare cases that do not require statutory intervention. That needs to be examined because it adds a level of vagueness to the system. When one speaks to front-line workers in this area, as I have done, one learns they do not think the system of classifying child abuse is unacceptable. They find it very difficult to deal with. Significant international evidence suggests that the introduction of mandatory reporting requirements in a jurisdiction results in a substantial increase in the number of reports made to that jurisdiction's child protection services. I will conclude by complimenting the Minister on the introduction of this worthwhile legislation, while reminding him that it will be completely undermined if it is not matched with substantial additional resources for certain aspects of our social services and the Garda Síochána.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_343">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_448">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I am pleased that the Government and Deputies on all sides of the House have made it clear in recent weeks and months that there is an urgent need to do something about this issue. In light of the horrific revelations that have emanated from the Ferns, Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports in recent years - and most recently the report on the deaths of children who were in contact with the social services - it is long overdue for a way of protecting children from such horrors and abuses to be put in place. This Bill, which compels people to report arrestable offences to the Garda Síochána, is to be welcomed in that context. Essentially, it will criminalise the withholding of information on offences that have been committed against children or vulnerable people. While that is to be welcomed, we need to do a little more than simply making it a crime not to report knowledge or suspicion of such offences. There needs to be a link between our efforts in this regard and the whole question of the welfare of the child. The HSE website states that a person who is aware of a case of child abuse or neglect needs to report it to the HSE's child and family services. If this Bill is passed, will such a person be required to make that report to the Garda Síochána? Such a report would not be enough because it would focus on penalising the offender without doing anything to uphold the obligation on the social services of the State to take action to protect the child in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> It is clear that offenders need to be reported but the stated aim of this Bill is to protect children and vulnerable adults from serious offences. The reporting of perpetrators really only does half of that job. Where is the Children First Bill? The initial Children First guidelines were published in 1999. We need legislation to be passed to ensure the very good recommendations in Children First are put on a statutory footing. That should lead to the real implementation of the Children First guidelines. It is crucial that our efforts to protect children have this sort of legislative back-up. The big question is what will be done when a problem is reported. How will children or vulnerable people who are at risk, or who are victims of abuse be assisted? If resources are not available to offer real support to vulnerable or abused children, all the legislation in the world will not really solve the problem. That brings us to the issue of cutbacks in front line services like social work, psychiatry and psychological assessment. All sorts of cuts are affecting the provision of such services. In that context, it is important to note what the Children First guidelines have to say on the issue of neglect:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_450">Neglect can be defined in terms of an omission, where the child suffers significant harm or impairment of development by being deprived of food, clothing, warmth, hygiene, intellectual stimulation, supervision and safety, attachment to and affection from adults, and/or medical care.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Carers, family members and even individuals can be guilty of neglect. Surely, by that definition, this Government is guilty of such neglect. The imposing of caps on special needs assistants, their removal from many schools throughout the country, leaving some of our most vulnerable without the necessary support, is surely an instance of neglect, whereby the State should be-----</p>

          <p eId="para_452">The Deputy obviously does not know there are more special needs assistants now than at any stage in the history of the State.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_345">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T13:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_453">I am well aware of that but the problem is we also have more children than at any time in the history of the State. There are 10,000 extra children entering the primary school system every year. In absolute terms, the question is not about how many SNAs we have; it is about the ratio of SNAs to the number of children in the education system, specifically to the number of children with special needs, a number that is increasing. The fact is, by imposing caps the Government is reducing the level of support provided to the most vulnerable children. That is neglect, and if we are serious about protecting children that level of neglect should be criminalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Similarly, there is the removal or threatened removal of measures such as the domiciliary care allowance, again for parents of children with special needs, disabilities and so on. This is an instance of State neglect. Is the Government going to held legally responsible for that level of neglect, which is being inflicted on some of our most vulnerable children? There are the cuts imposed on disadvantaged schools and the cutbacks to front-line services. Some child mental health services are seeing only emergency cases and are turning away everything else. Waiting lists for speech and language therapy are extremely long; the availability of psychologists to do assessments is woefully inadequate. One of the parents involved in the DCA Warriors protest outside the Dáil the other day told me there are now no psychologists in County Cavan to provide assessments for children with special needs. That sort of situation is being replicated all over the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> As I pointed out to the Tánaiste in the Dáil the other day, if we are serious when we talk about protection for children and preventing neglect and abuse, the most obvious obligation the State has is to provide housing, a roof to go over the heads of children that is of decent quality and secure. The State is failing abysmally in that. I do not know whether studies have been done on it but I would bet my bottom dollar that if one looks at the most vulnerable children, the victims of abuse and neglect, who have ended up in various institutions, there will be a correlation between that and coming from poor and inadequate housing conditions, housing insecurity, and so on. That is blatantly obvious. Yet the way in which the State is failing in its obligation to provide housing for some of the least well-off families and their children is getting worse by the day. Every week the cuts in rent caps are forcing dozens of families with young children into homelessness. Is that not neglect on the part of the State? Is it not a recipe to ensure that in certain cases those families will break down and the children involved will end up in very vulnerable situations where they could be victims of neglect and abuse? </p>
          <p eId="para_456"> That is a major failure of the State. I want to know whether, if this Bill is passed, the State will be guilty of a crime if it fails to provide the necessary supports, protections, resources and services for all our children, but particularly for our most vulnerable children, those with special needs, disabilities and from poor backgrounds. The State should be liable for those sorts of failures. Will it be a crime for us in this House, or for members of the public, not to report the Government for its criminal negligence when it comes to the protection of our children? One must wonder whether the raft of legislation coming through, all, on the face of it, formally and nominally good, all heading in the right direction and well-intentioned, is not just window dressing if we do not actually provide the resources and services required. The policy in regard to the provision of those resources and services, housing, psychological assessment, all the things that would protect children, is that they are being systematically cut and will be cut again in the budget of December and the one after it.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> I ask the Minister and the Government to be consistent. This Bill is fine, as far as it goes. I would like to see the Children First Bill introduced as well but it will mean very little unless it is backed up with the resources and services our children, our most vulnerable citizens, require in order to be genuinely protected.</p>

          <p eId="para_468">-----giving us the same story, not to pay this one, not to pay that one. The reality is he has never given a common sense way of raising that money and that is a fact. It is time to do things and I agree with the Deputy these are all needed but let us come up with an honest and constructive way of doing this. It is as simple as that and I will wait for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> As the Minister and many others have stated, the purpose of the Criminal Justice Bill 2012 is to close an existing loophole in the law. Under the current legislation it is an offence to withhold information in respect of a serious criminal offence. However, this excludes sexual offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">For that reason the Government has brought forward this Bill to ensure that all serious offences, including those of a sexual nature, must be reported to the Garda. I hope and expect that this will make some difference in the protection of children and vulnerable adults in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> We can all agree that the stories and revelations contained in the Ryan, Murphy, and Cloyne reports were shocking to say the least. It is sad that reports like those were needed to shock this House into action, and some of the responsibility for the abuse suffered must fall on the State, but lessons have been learned and the introduction of this Bill is proof of that. What is clear from the statements made by victims is that if those who had knowledge of sexual offences committed against children in the past had informed gardaí, many subsequent crimes could have been prevented. There is no stronger argument for this Bill than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> Many of those reports refer to clerical and institutional abuse but the fact remains that most abuse occurs within families. This was something we in the justice committee raised at the time and I know the Minister has also acknowledged that fact. We cannot ignore the fact that many families will still refuse to disclose abuse in an effort to protect themselves and although this Bill will make that an offence, there is still a great deal of work to be done to reduce and eliminate abuse taking place in the home. Anybody who withholds information on the abuse of children or vulnerable adults should and will be punished severely under this Bill. Where information is not disclosed, without reasonable cause, offenders can face penalties of up to ten years imprisonment. Given the lifetime of damage that can be done to a victim, I welcome the type of penalties included in this Bill for those who fail to protect them from further or repeated abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> I also want to address a related issue, which has come up regularly in my constituency of Tipperary South, that of religious privilege and the nature of confidentiality between a priest and his congregation. This Bill will not change the use of that privilege. As it stands, religious privilege has been relied on in cases dealing with civil matters. However, dealing with criminal cases is a different matter and it is up to the courts to decide when this privilege can or cannot be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> It is important to note that this Bill does not deal entirely with the issue of sexual abuse in the State. The children first Bill, although separate, will address the issues in the HSE concerning the protection of children and vulnerable adults. The Garda can only do so much in this area. While they may be able to investigate a criminal offence against a child or adult, it is the role of the HSE to provide the necessary supports and monitoring of children at risk. I hope to see the children first Bill before the House as soon as possible. It is badly needed if we are to properly address the problems in our health service. It will require that the relevant persons in a position to assess children at risk must provide the HSE with the necessary information to monitor the children in question. It will also require the HSE to provide the right supports to a child who may have been abused. This was a real problem in the past and I hope it will be addressed in that Bill once and for all. It is important that the HSE would only be allowed to operate in conjunction with the Garda on any case with which they may be dealing and I would like some allowances to be made for that in the upcoming Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> I want to reassure my constituents that this Bill applies to everyone in the State, and it does not target a particular group or organisation. It is a logical step in the effort to further protect our children from sexual abuse, an issue on which we can all agree. I want to mention the people who have been at the heart of this campaign to protect our young and vulnerable people. In particular, I want to thank the victims and survivors of abuse who have spoken out and made their voices heard on this matter. I know personally that some people in south Tipperary have spoken out about their own experiences and I say well done to them for that. They may have been let down in the past but I want them to know that they have made a real difference to the safety and security of our children in the future. </p>
          <p eId="para_476"> I commend the Minister on bringing this Bill before the Cabinet and the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Kenny<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_477">The primary purpose of this Bill is to close an existing loophole in the law. Under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, it is an offence to withhold information in respect of a serious criminal offence. However, that provision of the 1998 Act specifically excludes sexual offences. This Bill is before the House in order to ensure that there is an obligation on persons who have knowledge of all serious offences, including sexual offences against children or vulnerable adults, to inform the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> I am certain all Members of the House agree that the content of published documents such as the Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports all provide what can only be described as a litany of profoundly shocking revelations that concern the sexual abuse of children. It is also particularly relevant to this Bill that these reports also contain shocking revelations regarding the utterly disgraceful failure to report abuse to the authorities. The fact of all of these matters is that if those who had knowledge in the past of sexual offences committed against children had informed gardaí, many children who subsequently became victims of abuse may have been protected from clerical sexual predators.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> What of the revelations contained in the Report of the Independent Child Death Review Group? It is clear that crimes against children are not confined to the church - it is obvious that the State also has failed children and vulnerable persons. We can also see cases - very serious cases - of vulnerable adults in institutional care being subject to awful sexual and physical abuse. As political representatives, we have not, as a group, done enough to prevent these things from happening during the past decades and it is time now that we did. Closing this loophole would be a start. All the revelations to which I have just referred make it a compelling case that this loophole be closed. There should be no arguments here, and I would like to see all sides of the House vote in support of this legislation, regardless of party affiliation. </p>
          <p eId="para_480"> This Bill must also take into account a further unpleasant truth - the fact that the balance of evidence suggests that the majority of abuse of children,or vulnerable adults takes place in the person's own home. Despite the awful damage done to children and vulnerable persons at the hands of clerics, the State and institutions, it is important to re-affirm that we are not just concerned with issues of sexual abuse by persons in these entities. It is important to state that the Bill applies to all persons and all organisations in all sectors of society. It is very important that legislation is produced that affords protection from abuse to children or vulnerable persons in any scenario and in any location. </p>
          <p eId="para_481"> Under the provisions of this Bill, it will be an offence to fail to disclose to the Garda Síochána, without reasonable excuse, information concerning certain serious criminal offences where such offences are committed against a child or a vulnerable adult. These "serious offences" are listed in the Schedules to the Bill. They will carry a penalty of imprisonment of five years or more. They include most sexual offences and offences such as assault causing harm, causing serious harm, cruelty to a child, abduction of a child, manslaughter and murder. The Bill also establishes some limited defences for persons charged under the Bill for persons such as a parent or guardian or a medical professional who is acting in the interests of the health and well-being of the child or vulnerable person.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> Section 2 creates the offence of withholding information on serious offences against children, and there are a number of provisions in this section. First, it is only an offence to withhold information where the person knows or believes that an offence has been committed and the person has information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of the offender. This means that a person is not under any obligation to inform the Garda regarding any kind of vague rumours, innuendo or suspicions. They only commit an offence if they have substantive information regarding an offence and fail, without reasonable excuse, to disclose that information to the Garda. </p>
          <p eId="para_483">Subsection 2(2) of the Bill provides that the Bill will only apply to information that a person receives or becomes aware of after the Bill becomes law. I understand that this was decided after consultation with the Attorney General, who came to the decision that it would not be feasible to make it an offence to withhold information where that information had been received before the Bill was enacted. While I can understand the point of view that anyone with any information should disclose it, no matter how old that information might be, in my view the Bill would be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge if there were to be a retrospective element to it. Making the law retrospective and applicable to information received by a family member, or to a person who provided support to a victim many years ago, would in many instances be unjust. This is where there would be a risk of the Bill becoming vulnerable under the Constitution. It would potentially criminalise individuals who had in good faith decided that it was not appropriate to report an offence to the Garda Síochána at the time that they became aware of it, but who would not be able to show that their decision meets the revised standard now required in this Bill. However, I welcome the fact that the new law will therefore apply to non-disclosure of information received after the Bill is passed, although it may relate to something that happened before enactment. This ensures that in regard to future actions, behaviours and responsibilities there is certainty and clarity in the law. </p>
          <p eId="para_484"> Section 2 of the Bill also provides that the victim cannot be guilty of any offence if he or she chooses not to disclose the offence against them. This exclusion was welcomed during the consideration of the Bill by the joint committee. Subsection (3) of section 2 confirms that the victim of any offence covered by the Bill cannot be guilty of the offence of withholding information where he or she does not report the offence to the Garda Síochána. Subsection (4) of section 2 also provides that the Bill is without prejudice to any right or privilege that is recognised in law. In that regard, this provision is simply to allow the courts to use their normal discretion in considering issues of privilege. There has been much media comment suggesting that this Bill has an effect on the seal of confession or sacerdotal privilege. As is the position with regard to the 1998 Act, there are no defences in this legislation which would specially apply to information received in the confessional nor is there any specific provision with regard to the confessional. It will continue to be a matter for any court before which a person is prosecuted to determine whether any particular privilege exists or applies in the circumstances of any particular case. It also must be borne in mind that existing provisions in the criminal law for the protection of children continue to apply. This includes section 176 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which makes it an offence for a person with authority or control over a child or abuser to intentionally or recklessly endanger a child by causing or permitting a child to be placed or left in a situation which creates a substantial risk to the child of being a victim of serious harm or sexual abuse. It is also an offence to fail to take reasonable steps to protect a child from such risk while knowing that a child is in such a situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> It is worth stating that the issue of sacerdotal privilege has never arisen with regard to the offences prescribed by the 2006 Act nor in relation to the offences in this Bill which are currently covered by the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. It should be borne in mind that the issue of confession does not arise in regard to the many cases of criminal offences identified in the Ryan, Murphy or Cloyne reports. These reports all relate to complaints of abuse made to the church authorities by the victims or by family members or by members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> Nothing in the Bill will impede any victim or any other person at any time going to the Garda Síochána to report an offence. The defences in the Bill solely relate to circumstances where the victim chooses not to do this, or does not have the capacity to do it. The defences are also necessary to take account of the fact that many children or vulnerable persons who are victims of sexual abuse are at a very young age and are often too traumatised by what has happened to them to be able to make an immediate report to the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> In submissions to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, reference was made to the issue regarding victims of abuse being without the capacity to report offences against them owing to their age or some other vulnerability. Such victims should be able to rely on another person to act on their behalf. The Bill provides that where the victim does not have the capacity to form a view as to whether the commission of the offence should be disclosed to the Garda, and the offender is not a family member, then the parent or guardian can make known, on behalf of the victim, that the victim does not want the offence to be reported to the Garda. An important safeguard in this circumstance is that the parent or guardian concerned must have reasonable grounds for acting on behalf of the child or vulnerable adult and must show that in so doing, he or she is acting in the best interest of the child. They must also show that they had regards to the wishes of the child. These provisions are set out in subsections (2) to (7) of section 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> There is a presumption in subsection (2) of section 4 that a child under 14 years of age does not have the capacity to decide themselves whether to report an offence. A child of any age may, if they wish, choose to report an offence and nothing in the Bill prevents this. The law would be inconsistent if it allows a person of 14 years or over, to give evidence under oath, but does not recognise them as having capacity to determine whether information in relation to an offence against them should be disclosed.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> In making these provisions, the intent is to ensure that the Bill will not discourage a victim from seeking appropriate treatment at a time when he or she is too traumatised by what has happened to go through the additional trauma of making a report to the Garda. It is therefore necessary that in cases where the victim is very severely traumatised that a treating medical professional can decide that it is not in the interests of the victim's health and welfare to report the offence at that time. It is important to note that the medical professional will still be under an obligation to notify the HSE of any abuse of a child under the Children First guidelines which are to be placed on a statutory footing by the Children First Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> This Bill is one element of a suite of legislation to protect children and vulnerable persons to which the Government is committed. This Bill has been drafted to complement the operation of the upcoming Children First Bill and the National Vetting Bureau Bill. I appeal to all sides of the House to support this crucial Bill. </p>

          <p eId="para_491">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation and also his colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald who deals with this area. This legislation, together with other legislation such as the Children First Bill, the National Vetting Bureau Bill, the new child protection and welfare proposals and the proposed referendum, represents a shift in attitude on the part of the State which is very welcome. Many reports have been issued in the past, going back as far as the Kilkenny incest report, dealing with matters relating to children and the abuse of children and vulnerable adults. We were aware of the situation but unfortunately, little or no action was taking arising from those reports. Even at this stage in 2012, we are only now beginning to put in place the architecture of legislation necessary as a first step.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> The culture of silence held sway over many years and it is not acceptable; it is not good enough nor was it ever good enough and it should never have been tolerated. There needs to be a complete cultural change, not just by organisations working in the area of child protection but also among the general public. I refer to recent surveys such as that carried out by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.</p>

            <p eId="para_495">I am very conscious that the cost of textbooks is a considerable burden on families. I have met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks and to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily. The association agreed a voluntary code of practice among their members, which commits them to limiting the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions in print unchanged for at least six years. The publishers also gave assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at substantial discounts so schools can purchase in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> If the Deputy has information that suggests that publishers are not abiding by the code, I invite him to provide me with it and I will take it up with the Irish Educational Publishers' Association.</p>

            <p eId="para_497">I share the Minister's concerns about the substantial costs for households. It is an issue that arises at this time of the year. I welcome the fact that last October the Minister received a commitment from the book publishers that they would sign up to a code of practice in regard to revised editions. There have been complaints, some of which have been aired in the national media, that a new edition of the home economics book, <i>Lifewise</i>, has been published. The publishers say the book concerned was published six months prior to the adoption of the code of practice. Whether it was outside the time from when the code of practice was implemented, they should have abided by the spirit of the agreement that was made with the Minister and his Department. I hope the Minister will pursue this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_498"> Another issue brought to my attention is the fact that a new edition of the English poetry book is published each year. I do not know if that is the case, but those complaints have been made to me and this is the proper forum to air these concerns.</p>

            <p eId="para_499">I thank the Deputy for bringing this matter before the House. With regard to the home economics curriculum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, last changed it in 1994. The first edition of <i>Lifewise</i> was published in 2006 and a second edition is being published in 2012. The code of practice provides for no revisions to existing textbooks for four years unless changes are required by the curriculum or due to examination changes. There has been a six year gap in this case between revisions. The first edition is still available to purchase online, as at 25 June last. The code of practice states that old editions will be kept in print for two years unless annual sales fall below 500 copies. It appears that this part of the code of practice is being complied with. It is valid to ask why schools are opting for the new book when there is no compulsion to do so. Schools must take leadership on this issue as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_500"> As regards the second matter raised by the Deputy, I do not have information to hand. If he has further information on it, I will be happy to receive it.</p>

            <p eId="para_501">The Minister has correctly spoken about the value of the book rental schemes. The more of those that are in use and the more leadership given by schools on this issue, the better.</p>
            <p eId="para_502"> There is another practical problem. It is difficult for parents or pupils to sell on books. In many cases, compact discs, CDs, are provided along with the language books and in many instances workbooks are part of the textbook. From a practical point of view, it is not possible to sell such books. That is a matter that could be addressed as well because it is a matter of concern. A number of parents, who have a number of children who have gone through second level, raised it with me.</p>

            <p eId="para_503">I agree with the Deputy on the last matter. Where a workbook and a textbook are integrated into a single document it should not be beyond the boundaries of imagination to construct a disposable workbook alongside the textbook. The textbook would remain valid and each year a cheaper, castaway workbook could be run in tandem with it. It is, in effect, built-in obsolescence to have a workbook which, if read by a student for one year, is considered to be interfered with and cannot be readily used by anybody else.</p>

[31185/12]</p>

            <p eId="para_505">My Department undertook a comprehensive consultation process on the proposed fund. Press advertisements invited views, which could be forwarded by post, e-mail or by a freefone service, which was operated by Barnardos. Officials also met with groups representing survivors of residential institutional abuse, the congregations and a number of other interested parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> Under existing legislation, it was not open to my Department to use the database as outlined in the question. The current Bill empowers the redress board to provide awardees' names, addresses and dates of birth to the statutory fund. This will enable the fund to verify applicants' entitlements to apply. That is the only purpose for which the information can be used. The Attorney General's office has advised that any direct unsolicited communication with survivors could be open to challenge as it might encroach on their right to privacy under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_507">This is one of the suggestions put forward by the Munster survivors group which I considered to be practical. It is a pity the legislation cannot be used in that way. One of the major criticisms of some of the groups about the redress process up to now is about how to get the message out. They are saying the same about this scheme. It is probably a smaller cohort but one of my major concerns is that it will compound the hurt if people who went through the courts or the redress process will not be informed. We know from experience that part of the difficulty is that many of the survivors of these horrible places have literacy problems, and the issue is to get around that. I considered this a practical way of doing it. If it cannot be done, we will have to consider legislation on it in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_508"> People are also saying that they feel sidelined by the process. I accept that the Minister met with a number of groups. Who were the groups the Minister's officials met? Many of the people who went through this process are not involved in groups and part of the problem is how to take their views on board. We need some form of outreach in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_509">I appreciate what the Deputy is saying. I met with groups before I was Minister and when I was education spokesperson for the Labour Party. I also met constituents who were victims but who did not want me to write to their home address. They had concealed it from the rest of their family and wanted to preserve their privacy. Then there were individuals who did not wish to be associated with any group. There are a number of groups and they do not necessarily all have the same opinions and views on general matters of policy. We are doing our best. This matter has been ongoing for a long time. The Committee Stage of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Bill is being taken on Thursday by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Sherlock, and some of these matters will arise in detail then.</p>

            <p eId="para_510">The difficulty is to try to get the information across. I accept there will be detailed discussion on this on Thursday but I would like to be convinced that everybody who is entitled to access this fund will be made aware of it. The issue is to fill that gap and ensure we do not compound the hurt. Can the Minister assure us that every effort will be made? Aside from advertisements and so forth, we must think outside the box on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_511">Some people suggested using YouTube or using embassy staff in terms of people abroad but we must ensure that everyone who is entitled to these supports under the statutory fund have access to them.</p>

I can tell him that 258 individual responses from the public were received and they broke down as follows: 135 telephone communications, 103 written or e-mail submissions from individuals and 20 written submissions from different organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_513"> The report on the consultation process within the Department is available on the Department's website but if the type of persons the Deputy is talking about have literacy problems they may experience difficulties getting access to the Internet. After so many years and with so many support groups having been in place, anybody could, and some have, gone to a solicitor seeking help from the original fund. There have been different avenues but we will continue to do all that we can to try to highlight this to ensure that nobody is left behind simply because they did not hear of it.</p>

Donnelly</b> asked the <b>Minister for Education and Skills</b> the plans or additional revenue streams, if any, he is pursuing, in order to reverse the current planned cuts to third level education, which over the next four years will amount to a cut of approximately 30% per student in real terms assuming the 6% cut in absolute funding in Budget 2012, 2% inflation per year and 18% more students; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_515">The reality of the economic situation and the public expenditure corrections which must be made in the coming years present challenges across all areas of public expenditure, including higher education. </p>
            <p eId="para_516"> At my request the Higher Education Authority, HEA, completed an initial study late last year on sustainability of the current funding system for higher education. The report outlines the scale of recent reductions in funding and growth in student numbers, and provides some evidence on the possible impacts of this on quality of provision. However, the HEA has emphasised that the report is preliminary only and that substantial additional work now needs to be undertaken before comprehensive proposals as to how we can sustainably fund higher education into the future can be developed. The HEA is continuing its work in this area and further advice is expected later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_517">I look forward to the report. As the Minister is aware, the position is that we are looking at a 30% per student drop in our third level system in the next four years. Last year, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, stated that between 2008 and 2011 there had been an 18% drop. Between 2008 and 2015, therefore, we are looking at approximately a 50% drop in funding per student. That will destroy our third level system.</p>
            <p eId="para_518"> I spoke to the head of human resources of one of the largest multinational companies in the country and he said that Irish graduates were becoming unemployable. He was talking about the decline in standard in the past ten to 15 years. He said that when the company is hiring at Masters and PhD level in Ireland it no longer advertises the jobs here. He felt that for that company's needs the quality of our Masters and PhD graduates relative to European, United States and Canadian graduates had become so unequal that they do not even advertise the jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_520">Yes. I know the Minister is aware of this but I put it to him that a 50% drop will wipe out our system for the next ten, 20 or 30 years. Will the Minister consider reintroducing student fees? I know that is a very personal issue for him. The report from the Geary Institute in UCD suggests that measure has not done what I believe the Minister intended it to do, which was to improve the quality of access. My concern is that if we do not reintroduce fees, and it must be backed by zero or low interest long-term loans, as is the model in other countries, our students will be left in nominally free education in institutions that are falling in standards. I do not ask for that easily. It is not a pleasant political message for anybody in this Chamber to send. My concern is that without something like that our students will be left in second rate institutions. Will the Minister conduct a cost benefit analysis of that and perhaps consider introducing fees in one or two institutions to determine how the students, and the institutions, react?</p>

            <p eId="para_521">I agree with the Deputy on a number of different levels but I am not satisfied yet that we have got the right economies within the higher level education system. I will give him one example. In the area of the provision of initial teacher education for teachers at primary and secondary level, the state of Singapore has one institution that provides the lot for primary and secondary. We have 22, and there are 43 courses between the five teacher training colleges on the one hand and various colleges that provide different forms of educational qualifications for secondary school teachers. This is a small country. We have invested millions of euro in the roads system and the transportation system, whether it is train or bus. The landscape in the 1970s when the regional technical colleges, RTCs, as they were, were established has shrunk enormously in that time. I want to make sure that as taxpayers we are getting very good value for money from within the existing system. I am not satisfied that we are getting that, but the full report from the HEA will help us to formulate policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_522"> I remind the Deputy that students at undergraduate level now pay a student contribution. It is not called a fee but it is <i>de facto</i> a fee. This year it will go up by €250 from €2,000 and in the next four years, including this year, it will go from €2,000 to €3,000. That is the contribution, and that is a higher <i>de facto</i> fee than many fee charging colleges. In the Netherlands, for example, there is a €1,700 fee per annum. We have crossed that particular Rubicon. Of the undergraduate students, 42% of them are on a grant of one kind or another that ensures they have the fee paid and also get a maintenance grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_523"> Regarding the Deputy's observation, the socio-economic spread of participation in higher level education has been transformed, and part of that transformation was due to better outcomes at second level, aspirations among young people to go to college, and the removal of the barrier that was the original fees.</p>

            <p eId="para_524">I agree entirely. On the socio-economic strata, the Geary Institute report suggests that the lower socio-economic percentage has remained constant but I defer to the Minister's expertise in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_525"> I agree entirely with the Minister. For example, in teacher training, if the figures I have seen are correct, 70% of new hires have come from Hibernia College, which is essentially zero cost to the State-----</p>

I agree that the first thing to do is find all of these inefficiencies quickly and ruthlessly. Nonetheless, if we take Buffalo University in the United States, which is a mid-ranking US university, its total funding is 30% more than our entire university system. That is what we are competing with. I know this is a difficult issue for the Minister and that promises were made before the election. I know he brought in this measure. I benefited from it as a student, and I appreciate that, but I ask the Minister to re-examine it with the back-stop of zero or very low interest loans that only kick in through when the graduate salary hits a certain amount.</p>

            <p eId="para_531"> Overall, 9,950 posts will be provided for resource teaching and learning support for this coming academic year. That is the same number as that provided for last year and is an increase of 350 over that provided for in 2010. </p>
            <p eId="para_532"> Some 5,500 of these posts are available to the NCSE for allocation for pupils with more complex special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> Due to an increase in demand in schools it has been necessary for the NCSE to make an allocation of 85% of approved resource teaching hours to each school to ensure that every child who needs support can access support and are treated the same. This will ensure that there are a sufficient number of posts retained to make allocations for late or emergency applications, while staying within the European-imposed employment control framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_534">I thank the Minister for his reply. Since the late 1990s huge advances have been made in putting in place a strong system of support for pupils with special educational needs. We must continue to support young people with special needs in our schools and protect the most vulnerable.</p>

            <p eId="para_538">I acknowledge the wisdom and prudence in retaining 15% for allocation as the year progresses. I remember a question raised here previously with regard to special needs allocations and a substantial number of positions had still not been allocated as we approached the end of the school year. Does the Minister have a pattern for how the 15% is allocated over the year? Is it possible to allocate more of those posts earlier in the year? If the evidence from last year shows it is and if that is the pattern emerging, we should be more adventurous in upping the allocation above 85%.</p>

            <p eId="para_539">I agree with the Deputy. With regard to SNAs, last year was the first time we held back a 10% quota for emergency cases and late applications. This year we announced on the same day, both the SNA allocation and the resource and special teaching support systems. The practice and the experience from last year is informing us and it is probable we will be able to release more posts in the first round allocations than previously. We did not want a situation to arise whereby we would have no reserves left to fill a bona fide application and the person would be left without an allocation. I am informed by the director general of the NCSE that the incidence of special need, <i>vis-à-vis</i> either SNAs or resource teachers, is levelling off. Therefore, we can do the job effectively with the numbers we have.</p>

            <p eId="para_540">I thank the Minister for that clarification. The start of the school year is always an anxious time for parents with regard to the provision being made for children with special needs. We are aware of those concerns from what happened prior to the start of the school year last August. I suggest that if sufficient prudence was exercised so as to allow for a larger allocation of posts to be made initially, that would ease and alleviate some of the fears of parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_541">That is what we will try to do. With regard to the reduction in the allocation in terms of time and the breakdown of the minutes, a schedule of how the hour should be allocated was drawn up in 1993 and is now being revisited to see if it is an appropriate allocation of different kinds of subvention and support systems for people with learning difficulties. Last year, the reduction of 10% accounted for six minutes from one hour and this year there is a further 5% reduction. Therefore, the 15% amounts to nine minutes. We have sent guidelines to the schools suggesting how, through different ways of teaching, such as grouping some learners with difficulties together, we can maintain the same kind of productivity, notwithstanding the notional and nominal 15% reduction in the time allocation.</p>

            <p eId="para_543">I can confirm to the Deputy that in 2011 my Department purchased a site, subject to the granting of planning permission, to construct a new school building for the school in question. My officials have consulted with the planning authority and are currently preparing a planning application for a 16-classroom school.</p>
            <p eId="para_544"> In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects to meet demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The five-year programme is focused on meeting those demographic needs. The area in which the school is located has not been identified as an area of significant demographic growth. In that context, it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently. </p>
            <p eId="para_545"> All school building projects, including the project for the school in question, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time within the context of the funding available.

            <p eId="para_546">I thank the Minister for his response, although it is disappointing. Gaelscoil Chluain Meala was established in September 1994. It has approximately 216 students and 11 teachers and provides education through Irish to the highest standards. However, the building from which it operates is very old, substandard and unfit for purpose. The school does its best to ensure it is maintained properly, but it is unfit for purpose. It has taken 18 years to get to the point where it now has a site and in view of this I urge the Minister to ensure the construction of the new school is expedited, irrespective of other matters. The delay in getting to construction is completely unacceptable.</p>

Such permission has a shelf life or validity of five years. I will get back to the Deputy on the issue, but what should happen is that the process of applying for planning permission should proceed, notwithstanding the fact we do not have the additional funding available at this time. However, should such funding become available, they should then be ready to go on site immediately. The process of getting ready to go on site should continue.

The reports published by the NCCA in the past couple of weeks are important and support the development of a new language curriculum at primary level.

            <p eId="para_556">I share the concerns expressed by the Deputy. The crisis in literacy and numeracy in the primary school system and the results that emerged from the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, demanded a national response. I published that national response in June 2011. Over time, the cost of that response, including the additional year of teaching for primary school teachers from three to four years of study and from one to two years for secondary school teachers, will amount to approximately €19 million. From memory, the language initiative cost of the order of €3 million. I used that money in the following way: by closing down that initiative. The NCCA recommended this although approximately 550 schools participated and got good results relatively speaking. We heard the same presentation. The NCCA, by which I must be guided, did not recommend making it mainstream throughout all schools. A new examination of this under way from Professor Cummins and Professor O'Dwyer. We will see what they recommend. They are considering a different way of approaching continental language learning in primary schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_557">Did the council state why it did not recommend the expansion of the programme throughout all schools? The Minister said it does not compare to the British model and what is taking place there but other models exist throughout Europe. There is reference to a knowledge-based society and the importance of having a second or third language for skills and so on. All the literature and research has shown that the younger a child starts to learn a language, the better it works. We are lagging behind and this view is shared by many of the people involved in this initiative. The Minister should make clear whether it is a matter of money that is holding this back and, if it is simply money alone, perhaps we should consider other areas of expenditure.</p>

            <p eId="para_558">Money is a significant factor but it is not simply money alone. English speaking countries, principally Ireland and Britain, are far behind other countries in languages for a host of reasons. This applies not only within schools. A young person spends only 15% of his or her time in school. The remainder of the time is spent at home or outside at play or whatever. In some countries, Finland, for example, there is an explicit policy of using subtitles in all television and film shows such that one can watch programmes in English with subtitles. Young people and adults in Finland learn English while reading the Finnish subtitles. There are various ways in which the acquisition of language is made easier. Popular music is mostly in English now but that was not the case 20 or 30 years ago. In a sense we are at a disadvantage because we are not getting the same cultural cross-references. People are probably learning more Irish now from TG4 programmes with subtitles than was the case previously. I await the new report from the two academics and I hope we will get a sense of how we can improve our linguistic skills, which are behind those of other countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_560">Project Maths is currently being phased in at post-primary schools. The textbook is one of many tools a teachers uses to support the delivery of the curriculum. Project Maths emphasises a range of skills that are beyond the scope of any textbook. Successful implementation depends on the skills and pedagogical knowledge of teachers which are developed through continuing professional development, CPD, peer learning and exchanges of best practice. Continuing professional development has been and continues to be made available to every mathematics teacher in the country. There is also an extensive range of resources for teachers and students available at<i> projectmaths.ie</i>. From this September, a post-graduate diploma funded by the Department will be made available to out-of-field teachers of mathematics. Textbooks for Project Maths are available on the market. Publishers have been making available supplements to their textbooks to reflect the evolving syllabus.</p>

            <p eId="para_561">I thank the Minister for his reply. The person who was in contact with me subsequent to my tabling of the parliamentary question indicated that the problem was somewhat different, that textbooks were being introduced each year and that this added to the difficulty. Project Maths was rolled out originally in 2008 and it became a leaving certificate subject in 2010 in 24 schools, which was welcome. Ongoing professional development is important and the network of education centres, especially the education department in the University of Limerick, carry out important work for teachers. The initial information I received was contrary to what was indicated to me subsequently. The message from some in the educational community is that they hope a time will come when there will be a set textbook available rather than changes every year.</p>

            <p eId="para_565">I welcome the Minister's reply. I have raised this matter with the Minister previously but let us take a step back from Project Maths to before the child gets to that stage. The Minster has probably heard of the concern among primary teachers that the fundamentals of mathematics are being eroded all the time. Will the Minister consider the issue of the use of calculators in primary school sector in consultation with the NCCA? This is all before the child gets to the Project Maths stage. There is a temptation at primary level to take the lazy route if one has a calculator in one's hand. One may not understand what one is doing or one may not understand the fundamentals of the calculations one is expected to perform.</p>
            <p eId="para_566"> I echo the comments of Deputy Smith on the chopping and changing of text books. The sooner the publishers are brought in by the Department, the better, given the fact that families are struggling to try to put bread on the table. Textbooks are changing year in, year out and sometimes only one page and the front cover are being changed. This is of great concern to all of us.</p>

            <p eId="para_568">In regard to Deputy O'Donovan's question, I met the publishers and they have entered into a voluntary code of practice. They will not change textbooks that are less than four years old and will maintain a supply after that point to avoid the chopping and changing to which the Deputy referred. I remind him, however, that schools and individual teachers decide on the books and this is why I have encouraged schools to introduce book rental schemes. If a maths teacher wants to change a textbook for a second year course, 60 books may be required if there are two streams in the school. The book rental scheme would act as a deterrent to chopping and changing. I have seen examples of the same book being presented with different illustrations or other cosmetic changes. We are trying to deal with the matter but we have no responsibility as such for the textbooks and it is a matter for the teachers themselves to change them.</p>
            <p eId="para_569"> I am not clear on the position regarding the difficulty in sourcing Project Maths material as Gaeilge. As Deputy Crowe will possibly be aware, I have a very good working relationship with my counterpart, the Minister for Education in Northern Ireland, John O'Dowd, MLA. I will make contact with him to find out whether he is experiencing similar difficulties and if we can devise a joint response.</p>

            <p eId="para_575">The SOLAS implementation group has primarily been working to create a roadmap for the amalgamation of the education and training boards and the further education and training functions of FÁS. We have established two pilot programmes, in Cork and Dublin, to carry out a paper exercise of assessing the challenges and issues that might arise as a result of the amalgamation. We are trying to establish the issues and work out solutions at this stage so that we can address them when they arise. We are putting in place the circuitry of SOLAS so that when the legislation is introduced we can throw the switch to allow the amalgamation to be completed speedily.</p>
            <p eId="para_576"> The amalgamation of 33 VECs into 16 education and training boards and the process of amalgamating the boards with FÁS are difficult challenges by themselves. We are trying to complete both tasks concurrently while also ensuring continued provision for the many unemployed people who deserve excellent opportunities in terms of further education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_577"> We are working hard to ensure that SOLAS comes into being as speedily as possible.

It is hoped that the amalgamation process will be completed by the end of 2013.</p>

All of us have met people in our clinics who have asked about SOLAS and whether it provides courses. Some are not yet fully aware that FÁS continues to deliver training services.

I spoke privately with the Minister while we were campaigning in the recent referendum about my shock at the number of people from outside this jurisdiction who were working in a certain enterprise because of a lack of people with specific skills here. At a recent party meeting a young person who is pursuing postdoctoral studies expressed concern about the drop in the number of Irish graduates undertaking postgraduate courses and, specifically, PhD courses in the sciences. She indicated that there was a visible decrease in the number of new Irish PhD students in postgraduate labs and pointed out that most people who achieve that level of education are guaranteed employment. She was concerned that these opportunities are being taken up by non-Irish postgraduate students. From her experience as a young person, she feared those who came to college a few years after her would not get the same opportunities to avail of the grant system, with fees paid and adequate maintenance.</p>

            <p eId="para_585">Science Foundation Ireland was a very good initiative established by a Minister in the Fianna Fáil-led Administration in the late 1990s and has put an enormous amount of money into science and science-related research. It has benefited in the main, but not exclusively, science graduates who want to do postgraduate work, including doctoral and postdoctoral studies. Substantial funding remains in that area. There was a difficulty in attracting people into the STEM areas and into science subjects at undergraduate level. My predecessor, Mary Coughlan, was instrumental in persuading the universities application system to award an extra 25 points for higher level mathematics, which is the gateway into science-related subjects such as physics, chemistry and engineering. If Deputy Smith's party member has specific evidence of declines in particular areas, I am happy to seek a detailed explanation. My impression is that there is no shortage, relative to the space available, of people to do postgraduate work in Ireland. However, there is an internationalisation of the third level sector at postdoctoral level. That is a good thing because Irish people move to other universities and people come to ours.</p>

            <p eId="para_589">In response to Deputy Lawlor's question, the problem is that financial institutions in the private sector are making loans available but, in many cases, parents or family relatives must go guarantor.

This is particularly true in the institutes of technology sector, where the needs of business and enterprise in the general scientific research and applied research areas can be met. I saw very good examples of that in Athlone over nine months ago. In implementing the Hunt report, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has asked institutes and universities to reply by the end of this month on their intentions regarding strategic alliances and collaboration as part of the review and reform of the HEA area.</p>

This commitment was given in the context of redeployment and comprehends teachers employed on contracts of indefinite duration who are covered by the teachers' redeployment scheme.

            <p eId="para_595">I understand the difficulty. The problem in getting good, permanent employment in secondary schools is that teachers tend to be teachers of subjects. Getting the number of hours required to teach a couple of subjects can be problematic, particularly in smaller schools. It is a topic I will discuss with the employment and management bodies in the area. The same problem does not exist in the primary school sector because the teacher is employed to teach a specific class, not a specific subject. It is unsatisfactory and the situation to which Deputy Crowe refers can arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_596">In this example, the person is in the job for five years. At this stage, the person should be moving towards a full-time contract. Lo and behold, once a teacher is redeployed, the teacher has been reduced to five hours and 20 minutes and has lost the support she received from the school. Are there many such cases? With the pressure in the system, we will get more and more of these cases. Can the Minister outline the number of cases this affects?</p>

            <p eId="para_597">I will take note of the specific request and provide information on it. Across the employment spectrum in education, the good news for teachers at primary and secondary level is that in the next six years we will have 45,000 extra primary school pupils and 25,000 post-primary pupils. Dividing this by the pupil teacher ratio, approximately 30, gives an indication of the number of teachers required. Redeployment out of the system, even including schools that will lose a teacher because of size and pupil teacher ratios, will not account for this. Demand for teachers is strong and will continue until 2024.</p>

            <p eId="para_599">I have previously put on the record of this House my support for any measures that can reduce uniform costs for parents, including measures such as the use of generic type uniforms or the use of sew-on crests or school badges. I have raised this matter informally with the National Parents Council at primary level and I recommend that the primary and post primary National Parents Councils mobilise parents' associations and schools' associations to raise this issue with school authorities.  I have since discussed the matter again with the National Parents Council and a further meeting on this matter will take place in early September. However, any arrangements in this regard will have to be made between school authorities and parents. It is important that schools are sensitive to the financial pressures on parents in making decisions, not just about school uniforms but about any matter that has cost implications for parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_602">Yes, it is lost or damaged. The same jumper could be bought online for €15 instead of €75. Clearly, somebody is making a huge profit off the requirement for jumpers to have a badge or crest.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> Are the Minister's hands tied on this issue? Is it a matter for each school to decide its own uniform policy? I understand that in some cases, the school itself receives part of the profit, which seems somewhat odd. The cost of uniforms is out of control and must be tackled. This is probably the last opportunity to raise the issue before the same problems arise with the start of the new school year in September. We all support the Minister's initiative, but nothing is happening locally. Can he indicate which, if any, schools have taken up the initiative? Unless action is taken, the current situation will continue and more parents will struggle to cope.</p>

            <p eId="para_604">This is an issue that arises at the same time every year. I am personally aware of the costs involved as I have a young son and grandchildren. The most appropriate solution is for a school to opt for a generic colour for its uniform, which could be delivered by the large retail units. As it is, uniforms are often not manufactured in this country, so it is not a question of disrupting local employment. The school would then arrange for the clothing to be customised with a badge or crest. That was the option advised to me by people in the garment trade. The production of the badge may be outsourced but is conceived and delivered locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_605"> However, it is not within my remit to oblige schools to take this approach. Rather, it is a matter for the board of management and patron of each school, and there is a large number of players in that particular chain of decision making. All I can do is recommend that schools explore this option. All I can say to the National Parents Councils at both primary and secondary level is that they should seek to mobilise parents on this issue. I understand there are some 1,600 parents' associations affiliated to the national council at primary level, which is where the intervention must take place. The Department cannot, under any statutory instrument or legislation, compel a school to do X or Y in the area of uniforms.</p>

            <p eId="para_613">There has been some public commentary to the effect that this issue has gone to conciliation at one of the arms of the State's industrial relations machinery. Given that we are talking about only 15 people, there should be no delay in finalising these matters. The Minister has huge experience in government, including in the area of labour affairs. He should use his skills to finalise these appointments. In my constituency, the two chief executive officers are excellent public servants who work way beyond the call of duty. I know very few other CEOs, but I am sure most of them want to have their new designation finalised. The earlier these very important foundations blocks are put in place the better. Before we know it, August will be over and the new school year will be beginning. Instead of depending on the industrial relations machinery of the State to resolve an issue among little more than a dozen people, the Department should bring it to a head as soon as possible in the best interests of the new education and training boards and the personnel involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_614">I acknowledge the concern and frustration the Deputy has expressed. Nothing is worse than uncertainty in any aspect of one's life, let alone one's employment. The people involved were all permanent CEOs, with the associated entitlements, and they have co-operated with the Department in regard to the reconfiguration which, as the Deputy observed earlier, amounts to a massive national reform measure. I am hopeful that by the end of July or the beginning of August we will know who are the designated people. They will be working with the acting CEOs until the legislation is enacted and commenced. Once identified, the CEOs designate will immediately commence work with two acting CEOs or, as the case may be, one permanent CEO and an acting CEO, in which case the permanent CEO would have less seniority than the designated person who is coming in as the super-CEO.</p>
            <p eId="para_615"> I hope this initiative will bring certainty for the staff delivering the services. The VEC schools and colleges of further education and their client groups, that is, the pupils and learners, will not necessarily be affected by any of this. However, the delivery, management and administration of the system is already being affected. The sooner we know the identity of the CEOs designate, the sequence of appointments and so on, the sooner they can get to work in restoring the confidence and momentum that have been lost.</p>

            <p eId="para_624"> However, this month, my Department has made an advance payment of an estimated reimbursement to the European Commission in respect of the SR Technics programme.

Debit notes in respect of 90% of the value of the EGF portion of unused programme funds for the Dell and Waterford Crystal programmes, in the amount of €5,380,480.17 and €506,332.35 respectively, were received by the Department on 25 June and are being duly processed. </p>

Upon my appointment as Minister of State, I acknowledged that perhaps the performance of my Department in the past had not been stellar in this area. I immediately initiated a review of the EGF application process. We had extensive and ongoing discussions and meetings with worker representatives from the three entities mentioned by the Deputy. We learned a lot from that process, which was used when we prepared for and lodged the TalkTalk application. I am confident that the outcome of the process that has been undergone in interacting meaningfully with the workers in Waterford, trying to establish as best we can - although it is a very difficult thing to do - what their training and further education needs are, will be a far more positive one than we have experienced in the past.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">The debacle at Ulster Bank continues. This morning we heard from the managing director of branch banking at Ulster Bank, Mr. Jim Ryan, who admitted that despite earlier assurances, customers will continue to experience disruption into next week. More than 150,000 people have now been affected by this failure, which is causing enormous difficulties for families, individuals and businesses. We are almost a week into it, yet key questions remain unanswered. I ask the Minister of State to try to answer them today.</p>
            <p eId="para_635"> First, how did a relatively minor software upgrade lead to such widespread disruption of the bank's payments system? Second, where was the bank's disaster recovery safety net? Experts say the bank should have had a second mainframe operating at a different location, which should have kicked into action when the initial fault arose. </p>
            <p eId="para_636"> Third, what is to say that this kind of problem will not occur in other banks operating in this State in future? We know that in 2010, the Bank of Ireland experienced problems with its IT system. How do we know that similar system failures being experienced at Ulster Bank are not unique to that bank? Ulster Bank has not answered the questions adequately.</p>
            <p eId="para_637"> There also seems to have been a very slow response from the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Government in getting answers to these questions. The Government, the regulator and the Ulster Bank management need to answer these questions before an Oireachtas committee. Hopefully, the Minister of State can shed some light on this matter for us and, more importantly, for the 150,000 people who have been affected by this problem so far. There are hundreds of thousands of customers with other banks in this State who are worried it could potentially affect them also.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_638">I also welcome the opportunity to raise this issue. One of the most disappointing aspects for customers who have been affected is that the goalposts seem to keep changing as to when this crisis will be resolved. It was initially meant to be Monday this week, then it was to be fully resolved by the beginning of next week, yet there seems to have been a change in that position as well. We are now being told that the majority of accounts will be updated by next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> It is disturbing, to say the least, that the disaster recovery plan the bank is obliged to have in place, as all banks are, clearly did not work in this case. It raises some fundamental issues. The Central Bank was asleep for the first few days of this crisis. This first emerged on Tuesday evening last week but there was no statement from the Central Bank until Sunday. The Cental Bank then updated its statement on Monday of this week. We have not heard enough from the Central Bank and do not know exactly what it is doing. </p>
            <p eId="para_640"> The absolute priority is, of course, for Ulster Bank to get its systems up to date and for normal services to resume for its customers. I acknowledge and praise the work of ordinary branch staff around the country who are accommodating customers under very difficult circumstances. </p>
            <p eId="para_641">What we need is a comprehensive investigation by the Central Bank into what happened, how it is being handled and the systems in place at Ulster Bank. Also, the Central Bank should rigorously test the contingency plans of all banks providing services to Irish customers. This needs to be done. It is not enough for the Central Bank to ask the banks to review their systems. The Central Bank, as the regulator and consumer watchdog, needs to rigorously test all of the systems in the banks here. We cannot afford something like this happening again.</p>

            <from>Deputy Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine  Shane McEntee<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_642">Deputies Doherty and Michael McGrath have made relevant points. I always believed something like this would happen. Banks no longer provider a personal service: everything has been computerised. As stated by the Deputies, there is no doubt but that this could happen again. I agree with them that we should call in the relevant people to explain what happened and that many people are under pressure owing to the slowness of the bank to address the problem. While I cannot respond to all of the Deputies' questions now, I will ensure they are responded to in a written reply. This was bound to happen at some stage. Perhaps now the banks will return to employing counter staff rather than relying on computers.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> This issue has been ongoing since last week and must be resolved as a matter of priority. Ulster Bank, as part of the RBS group, last week experienced severe technical problems triggered by a software update late on Tuesday 19 June, which caused the RBS group's computer system to fail. As a result, payments going into and out of accounts overnight were not processed, causing a huge backlog across RBS and NatWest branches and subsidiaries, including Ulster Bank. The outage also created some technical instability in the system which exacerbated the problem and caused further delays. An initial attempt to provide a "patch" to the system last Thursday, 21 June failed. This amplified the backlog issue and led to further delays across the Ulster Bank system.</p>
            <p eId="para_644"> The EMC met separately with Ulster Bank to discuss its current problems. Ulster Bank's chief executive assured the EMC that resolution of this problem is its top priority. He also set out the measures that the bank is taking to assist customers, including the extension of bank opening hours to assist customers to transact their business; the addition of 100 staff to their telephone assistance lines; increased discretion of branch managers to pay out funds to customers so as to ensure they have access to pay and social welfare and the transfer of temporary additional staff from RBS Group in the UK to Ireland to assist in clearing the backlog.</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> The Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank are receiving regular status updates from Ulster Bank. Management at Ulster Bank have stated that no customer, including customers of other banks, will be out of pocket as a result of this issue. We know that they will keep to their word and ensure that this will be the case for all Irish customers. We will hold them to that. Once its systems are up and running, the bank will commence the process of refunding customers any interest, fees or charges that have occurred as a result of this incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> The Minister, Deputy Burton, has obtained assurances from Ulster Bank that it is taking measures to minimise the impact on customers who have been experiencing delays in receiving their social welfare and other payments from the bank. We expect Ulster Bank to ensure that the impact of delays for elderly or more vulnerable customers is addressed and that flexible arrangements are guaranteed by it during this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_647"> The basic systems failure has now being rectified. However, there is still a considerable backlog which the Ulster Bank needs to remedy. We have been told this work will continue around the clock until this weekend. Ulster Bank, as part of the RBS group, operates on a commercial basis, at arm's length from the State but where systemic failures occur there are steps that need to be taken by the institution to ensure they are not repeated. Obviously, there are issues around its IT infrastructure. I note that the Governor of the Bank of England, Mr. Mervyn King, has suggested that the FSA should investigate the cause of the system failure at RBS.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> For members of the public specifically, the technical problems led to what the Ulster Bank management have accepted as "unacceptable delays" in relation to three core functions, namely, payroll processing, branch batch payments and payment of direct debits and credits. Ulster Bank intends to have the payroll processing rectified by today and has secured support from AIB on batch processing. The bank will continue its work on the issue of direct debits and credits throughout the next few days. Ulster Bank ATMs remain available for use. We expect the backlogs to be cleared as soon as possible to ensure that Ulster Bank customers and other affected customers have correct balances in their accounts. Other Irish banks have sought to provide technical support to Ulster Bank while it works through this process to minimise the effects across the Irish banking system. We are glad that this has largely been achieved. The Central Bank is in constant touch with Ulster Bank. Management at Ulster Bank have been told to ensure that there are sufficient levels of information and constant communication with their customers and the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_649"> We sympathise with the disruption to Ulster Bank customers and appreciate the efforts of staff at the bank in terms of trying to support customers. However, we expect a rapid rectification of this situation and an assurance that the IT issues will be comprehensively addressed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_650">I welcome that the Minister of State has undertaken to ensure we receive a written response to any of the questions he cannot respond to today. The Minister of State referred in his reply to the call by the Governor of the Bank of England for an investigation into this matter. There has been no call by our Financial Regulator, which regulates Ulster Bank in this State, for any investigation. Where a problem occurs in a bank, be it hiding of losses in terms of its capital or an IT failure, it is already too late. We have structures in place to ensure this does not happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> Is the Minister of State satisfied that the Financial Regulator was robust enough in terms of ensuring emergency contingency plans were in place at Ulster bank? Is he satisfied that other banks in this State, of which the majority of people in this state are customers, have contingency plans in place? Ulster Bank assurances aside, what does the Government propose to do in this regard? The Minister of State said he hoped the banks would return to employing counter staff rather than relying on IT systems. That, unfortunately, is not what is going to happen. We all know that the banks will soon lay off thousands of people. IT managers in the banks are working overtime to devise automated systems. This is an issue of huge importance in terms of customer relations into the future and confidence in our banking system.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_448">
            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_652">The Minister of State alluded in his remarks to the thousands of Ulster Bank customers whose social welfare payments and monthly salaries are due to be paid into their accounts this week. It is critical these people are reassured that they will have access to their money. Not everyone has the benefit of an Ulster Bank branch around the corner from them. This affair has caused enormous distress and inconvenience for many people. It is not sufficient to say that people will not be out of pocket. We need an assurance that there will be no black mark recorded on the credit history of people whose mortgage or loan repayments were missed through no fault of theirs. People in the UK are already having difficulty having their record corrected. We need to ensure there is no such consequence here.</p>
            <p eId="para_653"> I again call on the Central Bank to undertake a thorough investigation into this matter. While it may have originated in the RBS Group and outside of our jurisdiction it is affecting Irish customers and Irish banks. The Central Bank needs to thoroughly investigate this matter and to rigorously stress test the contingency plans in place in all Irish banks. This could happen again.</p>

            <p eId="para_654">As stated, this could happen in any bank. It has happened once and could happen again. It is crucial that the relevant bodies are brought before us to explain what went wrong. If this were to happen again the whole country could be brought to a standstill. Deputy Michael McGrath referred to the person who may apply for a car loan in six or 12 months time only to find a black mark recorded against him or her. We must call in the relevant people from the Central Bank and other banks to ensure this does not happen. This matter will be forgotten about in six months time. It is important then that this matter is addressed prior to the recess. This could happen in any bank. I always knew it would happen at some stage. In my view, technology has gone too far. This is a warning, at great cost to many people. I agree with Deputies' comments on the matter, including that a person who applies for a car loan in six months time may be refused it because of this, which refusal will be communicated to the local branch manager who no longer has any say in that regard.</p>

          <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_450">
            <from>Deputy Dan Neville<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_655">I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue and thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to do so. I wish to discuss the role of Irish overseas aid in education because it is an area that can be marginalised during times of international recession. It is ten years since the international community including Ireland adopted the millennium development goal of education for all in the Third World. The millennium development goals recognise explicitly the interdependence between growth, poverty reduction and sustainable development. The millennium development goals commit to the achievement of universal primary education and underpins education for all in the Third World.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> Education is the key to breaking the poverty cycle in the Third World. A child born to a literate mother is 50% more likely to survive past the age of five years. A single year of primary school increases the wages people earn later in life by 5% to 15% for boys and even more for girls. No country has ever achieved continuous and rapid economic growth without first having at least 40% of its adults able to read and write. Gains in women's education made the most significant difference in reducing malnutrition, outperforming a simple increase in the availability of food. Women with six or more years of education are more likely to seek prenatal care, assisted childbirth and postnatal care, reducing the risk of maternal and child mortality and illness in the Third World.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> It is easy to lose sight of what is at stake with regard to education. Ultimately, the world economy will recover from the global recession we are experiencing, but the crisis could create a lost generation of children in the world's poorest countries, whose life chances will have been jeopardised by a failure to protect their right to education. Ireland can and must play its part in averting this imminent lost generation. Our international aid policy must place education as the cohesive core behind all our aid priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> Our aid policy should reflect a number core principles, which I will now outline. Education is a fundamental human right with each state being the primary provider of education and it should be supported to provide quality education for all in the Third World. Education must be comprehensive and the education for all goals must be promoted as a holistic education policy. The focus on achieving universal primary education must be complemented by an approach which supports education for all across the age spectrum. Civil society is crucial to educational progress and it must be supported to promote democratic institutions and to hold governments to account for policy decisions, including the financing of education and the formulation of education policy. I saw the difficulties civil society has in influencing the situation in Africa during my recent visit to Ethiopia with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade. Education for all must mean "all". Discrimination against girls and women in education continues to persist in the Third World. Children with disabilities constitute one third of all out-of-school children.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> Ireland must ensure its aid policy reflects the core importance of education to achieving all other development goals. In particular, education is the key to poverty reduction. Ireland must meet its revised commitment of 0.7% of GDP by 2015 and, in particular, must commit at least 8% of overseas development aid to basic education. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, comment on the Government's position on these targets? Irish Aid must provide clear and transparent figures to show annual funding of the education for all goals and what percentage this is of the larger overseas development aid budget.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe Costello)<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_660">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I welcome this opportunity to address the vital role education plays in the Government's overseas aid programme. We in Ireland know the central role education plays in unlocking potential and enabling economic and social development. We have brought these lessons to bear on our approach to working with developing countries to empower them to drive their own development.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> According to the latest figures from UNESCO more 61 million children of school going age remain out of school today. On top of this grim statistic, approximately 200 million children in school are not able to read a simple sentence because the quality of education they receive is of such poor quality. Nevertheless, real progress has been achieved in recent years. Many countries have made significant progress towards achieving universal primary education during the past decade. From 1999 to 2008 an additional 52 million children enrolled in primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> Education is central to the Irish Aid programme because it helps eradicate poverty and hunger and builds the knowledge and skills people require to build better lives. The 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid recognised education as a fundamental human right. Building on this, Irish Aid's education policy has a strong focus on building sustainable education systems to deliver good quality education. Through Irish Aid, we have provided a total of €48.7 million on education programmes in developing countries in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> Our education policy is implemented through a number of different channels. At global level Ireland is a significant contributor to the Global Partnership for Education, GPE, and we will provide approximately €4 million this year. The GPE supports the implementation of education plans in more than 45 countries, many of them emerging from conflicts or natural disasters and in great need of assistance. Another key part of the work of the GPE is getting more girls into school.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> We also work directly with education sectors in four of our nine priority countries. Working with partner governments to build the infrastructure, skills and systems is a key priority. For example in 2010, some €26 million was provided to Uganda, Mozambique, Lesotho and Zambia. In these countries good partnerships have been developed between the education sectors and Irish Aid country teams. They are working to ensure the quality of education continues to improve and greater equity in access to education services is achieved. In addition to working with governments, Irish Aid provides assistance to civil society partners such as Concern and Plan Ireland for education projects in fragile states and for improving access to education for disabled children.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> As the House is aware, we are reviewing the White Paper on Irish Aid and have been consulting widely. One of the key messages from the public consultation is that there is strong public support for our focus on education, and a view that it reflects our values and our experiences as a people. I am committed to ensuring that education will continue to be a priority area for the Government's aid programme in the years ahead.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dan Neville<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_666">I thank the Minister of State for his response. We should acknowledge that earlier this year Irish Aid was recognised as being second best in the field of international aid after the World Bank, which is an enormous compliment. Will the Minister of State ensure we use our influence to support the new global fund for education for all? Ireland must use its influence in multilateral organisations such as the IMF and the World Bank to ensure their policies and practices are aligned to the achievement of the education for all goals.</p>
            <p eId="para_667"> We must ensure Irish overseas development aid does not focus on numbers enrolled to the detriment of education quality. The key to quality education is properly trained teachers whose conditions and levels of remuneration ensure their retention. Ireland must emphasise education quality and ensure we address teacher recruitment, training and development in the Third World, and the need to recruit and retain female teachers, teachers with disabilities and teachers from other marginalised groups to provide role models for excluded children in the Third World. This group includes girls, children and adults with disabilities, child labourers and children and adults affected or displaced by conflict or climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">Ireland must commit to demand-side strategies, such as the abolition of school fees, and push for a similar commitment among partner governments and other donors. Such strategies would help vulnerable groups to access quality education. Internationally, Ireland must commit to the educational inclusion of everyone of everyone in the Third World. It is a key part of the future development of the Third World. As someone who came through the Irish educational system at a time when this country was on the verge of Third World status, I am aware of the part it played in ensuring Ireland is a First World country today. Education is one of the keys to saving the Third World.</p>

            <p eId="para_669">I agree with everything the Deputy has said. Anyone who was born and raised in Ireland will recognise the importance of education in the progress this country has made. Irish parents, like the country as a whole, have always emphasised the importance of education. For that reason, we have no choice other than to introduce the same key principle to our overseas development aid programme. Between 10% and 12% of our overseas aid is spent on education. I am sure education will remain a key principle when the review of the White Paper has been completed. We recognise it as a fundamental right and we will continue to do so. Ireland's expenditure on education as part of overseas development is well above the OECD average. I accept that 61 million young people around the world do not go to school. At least three times as many young people are getting a poor quality of education. Given that difficulties are encountered by many people when they try to go to school, particularly girls, we are concentrating on gender equity in education. We will increase further the number of fellowships for people from Third World countries who wish to come to Ireland to receive a high level of training and education before going back to their own countries to train people in the same way. We are also looking at how best to use the large cohort of people who retired early in February. Some 2,000 of the 8,000 people who retired from the public sector at that time had been working in the education sector. We want to see how best we can harness the information, professionalism and managerialism they have in their areas of expertise. We will try to find new ways of providing skills in countries where training and education are needed and where managerial skills might not be widely available. We are focusing on and doing a great deal. Ireland will continue to regard education as a key principle of our overseas development aid.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_670">Some 92 people have been tragically killed on Irish roads so far this year. There had been 85 tragic road deaths by the same time last year. There have been 88 fatal collisions on Irish roads to date in 2012, compared with 76 fatal collisions during the same period in 2011. Tragically, seven people lost their lives on roads across the island of Ireland over the last June bank holiday weekend. Over the past decade, massive progress has been made in reducing the horrific carnage on our roads. In 2011, there were 186 deaths on Irish roads in comparison with 396 deaths in 2005. This does not include the accompanying number of devastating injuries, which can extend the suffering of families and individuals for decades.</p>
            <p eId="para_671"> An earlier analysis of road death figures highlighted that approximately 4,500 people died on Irish roads between 1996 and 2006, which exceeded the horrific death toll throughout the Troubles. Since the number of road deaths hit an appalling 396 in 2005, the number of road deaths has decreased to 365 in 2006; 338 in 2007; 279 in 2008; 238 in 2009; 212 in 2010; and 186 in 2011. The Road Safety Authority, which is outstandingly led by its chief executive, Mr. Noel Brett, and its chairman, Mr. Gay Byrne, has done an outstanding job on the road safety front during this period. Great campaigning road safety groups like PARC, which is based in County Donegal and is led by Ms Susan Grey and Ms Donna Price, have also played an major role in driving the road safety agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> One death on the roads each year is a death too many. Therefore, it is disturbing that the road death figures are inching up again. I understand that a new road safety strategy, to run from 2013 to 2020, is being prepared. The current strategy will end this year. Given the distressing rise in road deaths this year, I suggest that a reinvigorated road safety and enforcement campaign is needed now to prevent any further deterioration of the figures. One of the key lessons from other jurisdictions that have maintained good road safety records, such as Sweden, is that complacency cannot be allowed to set in. High levels of enforcement and continuous enhancement of road safety standards must be maintained on an ongoing basis if we are not to allow road deaths and injuries to increase steadily again.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> Given the need for continuous high levels of enforcement, grave concerns have been raised about the impact of current Garda cutbacks on road safety. It has been reported that 300 Garda patrol cars have been taken off the road this year. If that is true, it would be the highest number in years. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, told me last week that "on 31 December 2011 there were 375 vehicles allocated to the Garda traffic corps and there were 316 vehicles allocated to the traffic corps as at 1 June 2012". Some 337 gardaí volunteered to retire in the period up to February 2012. How many of them have left the traffic corps? What is the current number of personnel in the traffic corps? It seems to be difficult to obtain this information.</p>
            <p eId="para_674"> Has the new Garda roster had any impact on the traffic corps? It has been alleged that the introduction of the new roster has had a significantly negative impact on the operation of the traffic corps. Road safety groups like PARC have expressed serious concern about the impact of cutbacks on the level of general and mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints and on the number of breath tests being taken and tested. The Medical Bureau of Road Safety has reported a 20% decrease in the number of tests sent to it last year and in the previous year. It looks like less testing is taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_675"> PARC has also highlighted the inexplicable delay in bringing on stream the 22 extra intoxilysers that were requested by the Garda last October to facilitate the lower drink driving limits. Some 86 intoxilysers were deemed necessary but only 64 were installed. Can the Minister confirm when the 22 missing intoxilysers will be made available to the Garda by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, having been tested and approved by the bureau in 2011? Why is it not standard procedure for the Department of Justice and Equality to facilitate the training of all gardaí in the use of intoxilysers, or at least to ensure there is a garda on every Garda roster, or in every Garda station, who is trained in the use of these devices? It is unacceptable that the budget of the Road Safety Authority, which is based in Ballina, has been subjected to serious cutbacks. High standards of road safety cannot be maintained if key monitoring, testing and enforcement agencies are not properly resourced.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Michael Ring)<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_676">The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, has asked me to apologise for his failure to be present for this debate. On his behalf and on my behalf, I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this important issue. Safety on our roads affects all of our lives. It is vital that every effort is made by everyone involved to ensure our roads are as safe as we can possibly make them. The reduction in the number of road deaths has been a positive trend in recent years. Following further reductions up to the end of May of this year, this month has unfortunately proven particularly tragic in terms of fatalities.</p>
            <p eId="para_677"> The implementation of the measures contained in the current road safety strategy has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of road fatalities in recent years. The strategy, which covers the period from 2007 to 2012, identified a number of actions to be completed by various stakeholder bodies to improve safety on our roads. The core objective of the current strategy is to reduce the number of road fatalities to no greater than 60 fatalities per million population by the end of 2012. That equates to an average of 21 fatalities per month, or 252 fatalities per annum. The number of fatalities first dropped to below 252 in 2009, when 238 deaths were recorded. This number dropped to 212 in 2010. The lowest ever number of road fatalities on Irish roads - 186 - was recorded in 2011. This represented an average of 16 road fatalities per month.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> A report that was published by the European Commission recently shows that Ireland has moved ahead of Germany on road safety performance. We have significantly closed the gap on other leading countries. The report states that road fatalities in Ireland dropped by 13% between 2010 and 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">As a result, Ireland has moved up to sixth in the road safety rankings within the EU, with 42 fatalities per million population. The EU average in 2011 was 62 deaths per million population. In 2006, when the current strategy was being developed, the total number of fatalities on our roads was 365. The reduction to the 2011 figure of 186 represents a remarkable achievement in such a short time and is down to a combination of a number of factors including standard of vehicles on the road, the upgrade of our road network and increased enforcement by the Garda. In addition, the Oireachtas has played its part, with the enactment of legislation targeted at specific areas such as drink driving. l am glad to say one of the first acts of this Government was to bring through the Dáil the Bill dealing with the mandatory testing of drivers for blood alcohol concentration levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> Perhaps the biggest single contributor to the improvement in the safety on our roads has been the establishment of the Road Safety Authority. The RSA began its work only in 2006 but its effect was immediate. The many initiatives it has brought about in six years in all aspects of road safety have saved lives. A large number of people, perhaps without knowing it, will be glad of that.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> Taken together, the 2007 road safety strategy has achieved its stated objective of reducing road fatalities to no more than 60 per million population, or 252 per annum. The figures for this year, however, and for this month alone, demonstrate that we must continue to examine the causes of collisions and redouble our efforts to reduce them further. Although we use figures as a means of measuring the success of the strategy, these are not just statistics. Death or serious injury to a family member, a loved one or a close friend can have devastating consequences and can affect lives way beyond those involved directly in collisions. We must never lose sight of this aspect.</p>
            <p eId="para_682"> Unfortunately, the number of road deaths this year, to yesterday, stands at 92, seven more than the figure on this date last year. In this month alone there have been 23 fatalities, the highest monthly figure since October 2010. There appears to be no reason for the increase this month. We can expect numbers of deaths to fluctuate throughout the year but must be cognisant of any possible change in trend. The Garda and the RSA have examined the details, seeking a pattern, but there is none. The deaths cover all age groups and occurred in all parts of the country. The annual decline in recent years has been very positive but we must never allow ourselves to become complacent. The statement, "one death on the road is one too many", has almost become a cliché but we must keep in mind that every life we save, through our individual or collective efforts, is worthwhile. Our actions as politicians, administrators, enforcement personnel or technical professionals have a direct effect on people's lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_683"> In terms of invigorating the national road safety campaign, the RSA is currently in the process of developing the next road safety strategy that will include measures to ensure that Ireland continues to build positively on road safety performance for the remainder of the decade and beyond. This strategy will seek to drive new and ongoing measures to ensure that our road safety standards do not slip. We have invested too much effort in road safety to allow that to happen. The RSA is working closely with the Department in drafting the next strategy, which will cover the period 2013 to 2020. Discussion with key stakeholders is taking place and a public consultation process has begun. I urge anybody who believes he or she has a contribution to make in this area to contact the RSA and provide an input. When the consultation processes have been completed, the RSA will submit draft proposals to the Minister later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_684">I thank the Minister of State. The balance of your statement will appear in the official record and if you like to refer to any items that you have not covered you can do so in the reply. We are over time.</p>

            <i> Additional material not given on the floor of the House.</i>
          </summary>
          <summary eId="sum_46"> In the meantime, there are a number of initiatives the Minister is taking that will help to enhance road safety. In the coming weeks, he will bring 11 additional road traffic offences into the penalty points and fixed charge systems. The Oireachtas joint committee is examining proposals in a Department report that recommend an increase in penalty points for certain offences such as speeding, non-wearing of seatbelts and mobile telephone usage. A steering group in the Department, with assistance from all relevant stakeholders, is examining speed limits and speed signage. In addition, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is undertaking a study of all aspects of roadside drug testing including reference to and analysis of any equipment in use or whose introduction is anticipated.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_47"> The key determinant of road safety performance is the behaviour of road users and the primary focus of any road safety strategy is to influence that behaviour in a positive way. In developing the next strategy, we must aim to influence that behaviour further in order to build on the progress made to date by the current strategy.</summary>
          <summary eId="sum_48"> June has been a particularly bad month on our roads. The battle to make our roads safer must continue and in spite of the relative successes of recent years the onus remains on all of us to continue with our efforts. Traditionallv, July has been one of the worst months for road fatalities. I appeal to everybody using our roads, motorist, cyclist or pedestrian, to be extra careful. There has been enough tragedy caused by road collisions so let us all play our part in making our roads safer.</summary>
          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_457">
            <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_685">I asked about the strength of the traffic corps and its current organisation. Perhaps the Minister of State might liaise with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, in order to provide me with some answers, even outside the Chamber.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> I refer to learner drivers concerning whom the Minister, Deputy Shatter, recently gave me some figures. Some 45 learner drivers were involved in fatal collisions during the past three years, 26 of whom were killed in those collisions. The PARC road safety group, known very well to me and to the Minister of State's colleague and fellow Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, from the time the two of us were transport spokespersons, told me that when gardaí set up checkpoints during March and April of this year, they found that 43% of learner drivers had no accompanying driver and that a further 30% were driving without "L" plates, which is completely unacceptable. Will the Minister for Justice, or the Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, take some action on that?</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> I have another query in respect of penalty points. We are told that some 300,000 people have been stopped on Irish roads who produced an Irish public driving licence but subsequently escaped having penalty points. In a previous arena, when the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, and I were covering transport we sought for penalty points to be applied to drivers from Northern Ireland. I am not sure if that has been achieved but the situation with other EU drivers presents an enormous problem because some non-Irish licence holders have been involved repeatedly in serious collisions. Has anything been done about that?</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> I refer to drug driving, a subject we used to discuss. We used to ask why we could not be more like the Australians and have the test that country has established in states such as Victoria and New South Wales. Has there been any change in that area?</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> Cultural attitudes to drink driving have changed, We saw this recently in the Minister of State's personal portfolio area during the European Championships which, unfortunately, did not offer a great national performance. One could see, however, that people did not risk driving to venues where they could see the game. </p>
            <p eId="para_690"> The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, is very active in the area of sports. Perhaps the Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, should concentrate on the nitty gritty of his own portfolio and ensure that the key elements that need to be implemented in transport are implemented. After all, there is no transport capital programme. Most of the programme that Deputy O'Dowd and I covered has not been implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_695">The Deputy raised some very serious issues, as I stated in my response. There is a steering group in the Department which is looking at these and talking to all stakeholders. I will ask that group to report to the Deputy and to talk to the Minister for Justice and Equality. The Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Justice and Equality are interlinked and they must deal with this problem. Some of the questions the Deputy asked today are specific to the Department of Justice and Equality. However, the two Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Varadkar, have regular meetings and I am sure they discuss these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_696"> The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is undertaking a study of all aspects of roadside drug testing, an issue I raised on many occasions when I was the Fine Gael Party spokesperson. It is very important. As many people are being killed on the roads because of drugs as because of drink and we should have the equipment to hand to test people on site to see if they are on drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_697"> The Deputy is correct in respect of an astonishing figure. In 2006 there were 365 deaths, one for every day. I am glad to see that in 2011 the figure was 286, an improvement of almost 50%. The Deputy is correct about the figures for this month, which are very worrying. According to the Garda and the RSA there is no pattern. The deaths are represented by all age groups and in different parts of the country. We must be very vigilant. The RSA is planning a new safety strategy. I will ask the Minister and the RSA to do something about this because in recent years July has been the worst month of the year for road deaths. </p>
            <p eId="para_698"> I cannot answer some of the issues the Deputy raised, which come under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality. I will ask the steering group to ensure it raises them with the Minister because they are very important. Road deaths have an awful effect on families. There is no family in the country that has not been affected by a road death. I offer my sympathy today to anybody who has lost a loved one to a road death, this or any other year. I know families in my town and county who have been affected by such deaths for the rest of their lives. For every life we can save, for every garda who can do his or her duty and ensure that people on the roads are protected from those who are speeding or on drink or drugs, we are doing a good day's work. All the State agencies are working together to ensure we can take that percentage of deaths below 186. That is what we are working towards.</p>

            <p eId="para_699">I do not mean this as any reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, but it is regrettable and disappointing that neither the Minister for Health nor one of the two Ministers of State from the Department is here to respond to this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_700"> The front page of our local newspaper in south Tipperary, <i>The Nationalist, </i>carries the heading "Trolley case at South Tipperary General Hospital". The treating of patients on trolleys in the corridors of the hospital has been an ongoing feature. There were 13 patients on trolleys on Monday last, 18 June, 20 on Tuesday, 16 on Wednesday, 12 on Thursday and 16 on Friday. Patients on trolleys is an ongoing feature of the delivery of health services at South Tipperary General Hospital as a significant number of beds in the hospital, some 31, have been closed due to Government cutbacks. </p>
            <p eId="para_701"> There is no better way of outlining the current position at South Tipperary General Hospital than to record what a patient at the hospital said in recent days. He stressed that hospital nursing staff, doctors and other staff were outstanding and gave excellent care but he was shocked by the number of patients on trolleys, particularly the number of elderly people, and was angered at the lack of privacy and dignity they had. He said there was little changing facilities for them and they had to use the hospital public toilets. He said that patients had to share screens and it was very difficult for doctors to speak to patients privately about their illness. He said patients found it very difficult to sleep on trolleys due to the general noise of the hospital around them and people passing though staff tried to keep the corridors where there were trolleys free of traffic as much as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> That is a totally unacceptable situation, particularly when there are 31 beds closed at the hospital. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that some of those beds are open to deal with this situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing Deputy Healy and myself to raise this matter today. I do not mean any disrespect to Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd either but it is downright shameful that neither the Minister nor a Minister of State is here to answer this matter. We will get the a standard answer that we always get and that is not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> Deputy Healy referred to the more than 30 beds that are closed. We have never that this level of overcrowding in South Tipperary General Hospital with the patients being treated on trolleys last week numbering 13, 18, 16, 12 and 16, respectively, and this is an ongoing feature. It creates too much pressure. It affords patients no dignity. It is not good enough or acceptable. </p>
            <p eId="para_705"> I compliment the doctors, the medical people and all the staff at the hospital for operating on a daily basis under that pressure, keeping their sanity, having good manners, maintaining a good relationship with the patients and doing their best, as reported by patients in an article on the front page of our local newspaper. I hear those comments all the time. However, this situation is clearly unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_706"> Where is HIQA when it comes to dealing with this situation? It is up and down the country closing nursing homes, two or three in my county. Its officials are looking for the carrying of name badges and other nonsensical requirements. Why are its officials not on the corridors when the treatment of patients on trolleys is clearly unsafe, unhealthy and undignified? What are HIQA officials not in this hospital? This sham must stop. They are attacking the running of private and public nursing homes and putting them under savage pressure. Where are they when trolleys are blocking up the place? Patients are on trolleys for up to a day and half. Where are the HIQA officials then? This farce must stop. The Minister promised he would eliminate the need to have patients on trolleys. </p>
            <p eId="para_707"> The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, closed St. Michael's unit at the hospital, which means that anybody with a psychotic attack in south Tipperary, other parts of Tipperary and parts of west Waterford must go to the accident and emergency department in St. Joseph's, adding to an already disastrous situation there. This is totally untenable, it cannot last and it will not last as something drastic will happen here. </p>
            <p eId="para_708"> It is beyond time that the Ministers came in and answered to the elected representatives of Tipperary South. I wonder what Deputy Tom Hayes and Senator Denis Landy are doing about this. It is not good enough for them to be merely rubbing their hands. We need action on this and at least the respect the Minister or one of his junior Ministers could show by coming in here to answer this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_709">I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health. I can assure the Deputies that the comments they made will certainly be brought to his attention as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> It is a very important issue and the HSE South Tipperary General Hospital regrets that because of increased activity some patients are experiencing delay in being transferred from the emergency department to a hospital bed.

            <p eId="para_712">Patient care is paramount in South Tipperary General Hospital. The situation is a priority for hospital management and is being continuously and actively reviewed. Additional staff are in the emergency department to ensure patient care and safety at all times. Hospital management wishes to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of all staff during this busy period to ensure that all those waiting for treatment and admission are accommodated in a manner that is in keeping with proper dignity and respect for all of the people in these trying circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> The hospital has experienced an 11% increase in activity from 2011. Of this increase, general medicine has increased by 32%. There has also been a 14% increase in patients from the north Tipperary area. On a normal day, about 108 people attend the emergency department and 21 of these patients, on average, are admitted. From time to time, a surge may occur in patients attending and this has been the case recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_714"> At 10 a.m. on 27 June 2012, there were 13 patients on trolleys. It is planned that at least four of these patients will be discharged today. In addition, four other patients will be discharged later today from wards to assessment beds or step down community hospitals. Further discharges may be made following ward rounds during the day.</p>
            <p eId="para_715"> The hospital escalation plan is in operation. The plan includes additional inpatient surge capacity, regular assessments of all emergency department patients by hospital consultants, evaluation of inpatients for discharge and management of elective activity. There are a number of meetings held throughout the day between the bed manager, the discharge planner, director of nursing, clinical director and hospital management to review and manage the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_716"> Liaison officers in the special delivery unit, SDU, are in touch with management on a daily basis and the situation is monitored as part of the three times daily trolley count by staff in the SDU. The SDU high intensity support programme is working with senior management to resolve the issues of overcrowding and reduce the number of patients on trolleys. </p>
            <p eId="para_717"> The SDU is working closely with hospital management to implement integrated discharge planning and to further develop the acute medical assessment unit in an effort to decrease admissions and length of stay. In this context, it is noted that the hospital's average length of stay, at 3.5 days, is below the national average and the latest hospital bed capacity review identifies the appropriateness of admissions and care as well within the recommended national levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_718">That response is outrageous and shameful. It did not address the issues raised. There is an acceptance in it that the hospital activity level has increased significantly and substantially with an 11% increase in activity over 2011 and a 32% increase in general medicine. The reply states that the average length of stay at 3.5 bed days is below the national average and admissions are well within recommended limits. The thanks that the hospital staff get for that is that they have to operate in a situation where patients on trolleys in the corridors on a daily basis is an ongoing feature</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> The patient I mentioned who was in the hospital recently and made this matter public confirmed, for instance, that patients on trolleys in corridors are a fire hazard and also pose obvious infection control dangers. Trolleys also pose a difficulty for cleaning staff who had to physically move the trolleys from one side of the corridor to another.</p>
            <p eId="para_720"> It is past time that some of the beds that are currently closed at South Tipperary General Hospital be re-opened. The basis for doing that is outlined in the Minister of State's reply in terms of increased activity levels, a shorter length of stay than the national average and more than an appropriate admission policy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_469">
            <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_721">I must agree with my colleague. This response is pathetic nonsense. All we get is jargon. The reply states that a number of meetings are held throughout the day between the bed manager, the discharge planner, the director of nursing, the clinical director and hospital management to review matters. When we had the sisters as matrons, there were none of these titles and we had good hospitals. As Deputy Healy said, we have worked very hard, kept within the guidelines, done everything we were asked to do and we are being punished. There are all these people in positions with titles and, no disrespect to those involved, they are pen pushers. There are all these new positions that carry fancy names. We need front line staff and the wards open. We do not need all these people in positions with fancy names, using all this jargon and going around carrying their folders. There is a bed manager, a discharge planner and a director of nursing. These positions were unheard of in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">This is what is wrong with the HSE and there has been a complete system failure. We have all these people while the front line staff such as doctors, nurses and consultants, are working tirelessly. The next development will be a clamping of beds in corridors. It is a shame and a disgrace and it is untenable. Nenagh hospital has been closed, there is not enough space in Limerick and that is why people are coming to Clonmel. The situation is the same in Waterford. Ministers avoiding the issue will not do anything for us. It is time we got some honesty, decency and fair play in Tipperary.</p>

            <p eId="para_723">I assure the two Deputies opposite who have articulated their strong views that the Minister will be made aware of their points of view. Either the staff are doing their best or they are not and it is clear that the two Deputies are commending the staff and the organisation of the hospital and its capacity to respond, given the difficult situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_724"> I refer to three significant achievements of the hospital. In 2010, South Tipperary General Hospital was chosen as one of the first implementation centres for the national colon cancer screening programme. It achieved second place in Ireland in the national audit of end of life care standards and it now receives postgraduate medical students from the University of Limerick and from Cork. This identifies the talents and capacity of the staff to deliver the best possible service, given the very trying circumstances under which they work. It is a national recognition of the significant work and the calibre of the staff of the hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_728">This Bill and other proposed pieces of legislation represent a welcome shift in attitude by the Government. I welcome the Bill and I compliment both the Minister and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. There needs to be a change in the national attitude. I refer to a recent survey by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children which found that 87% of respondents thought there was not sufficient information available about child protection and welfare. A worrying statistic is that 57% of those surveyed said they would feel nervous or not sure about, or would not report, a suspected case of child abuse or neglect. A total of 83% thought that children's rights are not protected in the same way as the rights of adults. The figure showing the number of people who are nervous about reporting suspected cases needs to change dramatically. Statistics from the Rape Crisis Network Ireland show that almost 80% of childhood sexual abuse victims were abused by someone known to them such as immediate family members, relatives or family friends. This fact needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> While I welcome the Bill and compliment the Ministers, it is important that resources for support services are put in place along with the legislation. In my experience and I am sure it is the experience of many Members, persons supplying services to children such as social workers and allied health professionals and support staff, have significant case loads and they are currently under significant work pressure. There is no doubt that new legislation will impose further pressure on a creaking system. The report which was published last week stated that it is a service which is not fit for purpose. I worry that while we may have the written legislation in place, the necessary resources may not be in place to ensure that the legislation is operative so that young people, children and vulnerable adults, are protected properly. There is little use in having the legislation in place unless the service supports are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> I recently dealt with a young person who is just over 18 years of age and who is in difficulty. This young person is in no-man's-land, so to speak; nobody wants to deal with the individual who is apparently too old for the social work services and who is left in a very grey area. The Minister needs to ensure that vulnerable young people who may be just over the age of 18 are not cut adrift as is the current practice. I reported that case to various services and to date, that individual has not been contacted by any of those services. Only for the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, that person would have a more significant difficulty. There needs to be a legal entitlement to after-care services. It is simply not good enough that persons who reach 18 years are no longer the responsibility of the State services. This point was made in the recent report.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> The 24-hour availability of social work services is urgently required. We have been talking about it for years. Pilot programmes are in place in some areas but a national comprehensive service available on a 24-hour, seven days a week, basis, is required. I reiterate the point that the resources need to be put in place because the service is not fit for purpose and it is seriously overloaded and under pressure. This Bill and other legislative measures will create additional references to the various support agencies and in those circumstances, the current system which is creaking and is not fit for purpose, will come under additional pressure and will not be capable of ensuring that young people and vulnerable adults are protected.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_474">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_732">Most Deputies will agree that this legislation is well overdue. Many people both here and abroad would be surprised that we do not have mandatory reporting of sexual abuse, particularly in the case of children, the elderly and people classified as vulnerable. I am pleased to note that the Bill defines a vulnerable person as a person suffering from mental illness or dementia.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">In 1998 the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act was passed to deal with criminal offences and now, 14 years later, we are dealing with another aspect to it which should have been dealt with a long time ago. This is welcome legislation. It clearly defines who should report offences and what the defences are. The defence of ignorance can no longer be used as an excuse not to report these cases. I particularly welcome that the legislation also covers young females who are subject to female genital mutilation. That is an important element of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> While I welcome the legislation, it cannot be given the seal of approval until the points made by my colleague about resources are dealt with. This will be key to implementing the legislation. The HSE is creaking and social services are under huge pressure. The case load they are dealing with is horrendous, as I know from dealing with cases in my constituency where people have gone to social services about their own children. There are also the issues of child and family services, the Garda, counselling and protection of those reporting. I am aware of a recent situation where a person who reported child sexual abuse had to move away from the area. They did not get the protection they sought and went through a great deal of distress as a result. The back-up counselling and support that is required must be put in place for this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> There is also the question of victim support. When the State takes over a case, even a murder case, the families are very much left out of the loop. They are not talked to and not engaged with by the barrister representing their case. That must be examined as well. Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether this is part of the Bill. It is important that these supports are put in place. There is no point in passing good legislation without providing the back-up for it, and our experience to date is that it is not available. Will all the services be resourced and not be required, as has been mentioned time and again, to do more for less? In this instance, one cannot do more for less. We are talking about the lives of human beings and people putting themselves forward for the first time in the history of the State under mandatory reporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> The confidence of the public in our services has been completely undermined. The recent report on Tallaght hospital put forward 76 recommendations on standards. The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, national standards for safer and better health care put forward 45 standards that must be improved. We have also just heard about Tipperary general hospital. Our mental health services lack resources. People cannot access support over weekends as it is a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. support resource. That cannot happen in this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> All these points must be taken on board in a holistic approach to this issue. Is the Minister putting resources in place to deal with the surge in reporting that will happen when this legislation is passed? There will be a surge, as was seen in other countries where mandatory reporting was put in place. I heard somebody say that in New South Wales there was a 600% increase in reporting. Have we the resources to deal with that? Are there resources and services for victims? These should be legally in place to provide vital support for people who have been sexually abused. The legislation is important but it must be linked with the resources required to implement it. We must see the new agency being established and working with the various agencies to ensure there is a check every quarter to assess how the services are progressing, that it is being supported and that it operates a 24 hour per day, seven day per week service for 52 weeks of the year. This is what is needed. Perhaps the Minister will address some of those points.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> This morning, I attended a briefing in Buswells Hotel where Amnesty International made some good points about rights. Fr. Peter McVerry said that governments do not usually like to introduce rights-based legislation because it means they must resource it. Perhaps this Government can prove different and provide the resources that are necessary for this legislation. One of the Minister's colleagues made the point at the meeting that while it is good to have rights and that he tremendously supported them, he wondered whether we have the resources to provide these rights given the situation we are in. It is a fundamental human right for a person to have access to care and protection, and the person who committed the crime must be brought to account for the criminality. I will support the Bill but I hope to hear the Minister discuss those points further before I will be happy to ratify it.</p>

        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_475">
          <from>Deputy Dan Neville<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_739">I am sharing time with Deputy Donohoe and Deputy Áine Collins.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill. It places a duty on all people, not just health professionals or others working with children, to report certain specified, arrestable offences to the Garda. It defines "arrestable offences" to clarify what offences should be reported. It applies only where there is actual knowledge or belief about an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> I wish to deal with the effect of child abuse, and the Bill is a very important intervention in this matter. We all abhor child abuse and repeatedly talk of that abhorrence, but it is important to understand its effects and the destructive outcomes for children. When child abuse occurs, the victim can develop a variety of distressing feelings, thoughts and behaviours. No child is psychologically prepared to cope with repeated sexual stimulation. Even a two year old who cannot know sexual activity is wrong will develop problems as a result of his or her inability to cope with over-stimulation. A child of five years or older who knows and cares for the abuser will become trapped between affection or loyalty for the person and the sense that sexual activities are terribly wrong. If the child tries to break away from the sexual relationship, the abuser may threaten the child with violence or loss of love. A child who is the victim of prolonged sexual abuse usually develops low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness and abnormal or distorted views on sex. The child may become withdrawn or mistrustful of adults. He or she can become suicidal. Children who have been sexually abused have difficulty relating to others, other than on sexual terms. Some become child abusers or prostitutes or experience other serious problems when they reach adulthood.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> There are often no obvious physical signs of child sexual abuse. A number of signs can be detected through physical examination by a doctor. Sexually abused children may develop an unusual interest in, or avoidance of, things of a sexual nature. They can experience sleep problems and often have nightmares. They can suffer depression and become withdrawn from friends or family. They might make statements about their bodies being dirty or damaged. They might think there is something wrong with them in the genital area. They may refuse to go to school, or become delinquent and have behavioural problems. They often become secretive. They sometimes display aspects of their sexual molestation in their drawings, games or fantasies. They may be unusually aggressive. The child may be extremely fearful of telling someone, although he or she might talk freely when a special effort has been made to help him or her to feel safe. If a child says he or she has been molested, parents should try to remain calm and reassure him or her that what happened was not his or her fault. Of course, they should seek a medical examination and psychiatric consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> As the Minister has a great deal of expertise in family law, I take this opportunity to raise the issue of the publication of reports of proceedings of family law cases. We must ensure that those reports do not contain any information that would identify the parties or any child to which the proceedings relate. I raise this issue because I recognise the Minister's international reputation and expertise in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> A key aspect of our justice system is that it is open to public scrutiny and can be evaluated by citizens. Another aspect is that legislators can evaluate and examine the way legislation operates in practice through the media reports on the effects of legislation. The publication of information will assist the public and ourselves as legislators to evaluate the effectiveness of our legal system in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> The family courts have taken an increasingly central role in the legal process in overcoming difficulties in relationships, particularly regarding the custody of children. We should examine whether our family courts protect the rights of children, and the rights of children is to know their parents and be parented by both parents regardless of whether they are married, divorced or separated, other than in exceptional cases where there is violence involved. Family law cases in this area usually deal with parents whose marriages have broken down or who are divorced. The children should be central to the issues examined by the courts. As a result of our lack of knowledge in this area, the Minister might use this occasion to give a quick briefing on the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> As I stated, a child should have automatic access to both parents. We must evaluate whether the family law courts are operating according to this premise. A child should have the right to know and have access to all elements of his or her family tree, including genealogy and medical information. Society and the State should support mothers and fathers equally, for the benefit of society as a whole, in seeking to be equally involved in the shared parenting of their children both within relationships and marriage and through the promotion of the concept of joint custody of children as a normal expectation in the cases of separation and relationship breakdown.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> The previous speaker mentioned children's rights and mental health facilities for children. Regarding the mental health of children, it is accepted that early intervention and treatment is crucial to full recovery in respect of child and adolescent psychiatric difficulties. We should have a recovery approach to the area of children's mental health. Children have a right to enjoy the highest possible standard of mental health. They have the right to enjoy a sense of well-being, control over their lives and the ability to realise their potential. Good health comes from having a balance in terms of all aspects of life - social, physical, spiritual and emotional. To vindicate the right to mental health, children need a supportive environment for themselves and their families and appropriate support and services when they experience difficulties. I appreciate the Minister is not directly involved in this area but I wanted to raise the issue with him. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is very committed to this area but I am concerned about her success in regard to the €35 million allocated by the Government to the area of community-based mental health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> A child's right to mental health today is far from vindicated. In a shocking violation of their human rights, children continue to be treated in adult inpatient units. Children face unacceptably long waiting lists for mental health services. There is patchy service provision across the country, responses that fail to meet basic needs and a lack of focus on early intervention and promotion that could prevent future problems for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> With no national directory of services, navigating the system can in itself be a nightmare for children and their families. Insufficient supports are provided for Ireland's most vulnerable young people - those in the care and youth justice systems. The mental health system fails to effectively link with the education system in early years, and the first point of contact for children outside of the family is a crucially missed opportunity. Children's rights must be respected to ensure that each and every child is able to reach their full potential. That is not a pipe-dream but a vision that should become a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> In regard to child abuse, the initial and short-term effects of the sexual abuse of a child usually occur within two years of the termination of the abuse. These effects vary depending on the circumstances of the abuse and the child's stage of development. They may include regressive behaviour such as a return to thumb sucking or bed wetting, sleep disturbance, eating problems, behavioural or performance problems in school and non-participation in school and social activities. The negative effects of child abuse can affect victims for many years and into adulthood. </p>
          <p eId="para_751"> Adults who were sexually abused as children commonly experience depression. High levels of anxiety in these adults can result in self-destructive behaviours such as alcoholism, drug abuse, anxiety attacks, situation specific anxiety disorders and insomnia. Many victims encounter problems in their adult relationships and adult sexual functioning. Revictimisation is a common phenomenon in children who were abused as children and research has shown that child sexual abuse victims are more likely to be victims of rape or be involved in physically abusive relationships as adults. The point I am making is that we often do not fully understand the effects of child sexual abuse on the life opportunities and experience of people who suffer it.</p>

          <p eId="para_752">I thank Deputy Collins for allowing me to contribute. I want to make three specific points on the Bill. I thank the Minister for being present to hear what Members have to say on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> My first point is informed by reports I read recently of a Garda inspector's report into the way reports of child sex abuse were handled and whether that could be done differently or better by the Garda Síochána. That report makes clear the responsibility upon people who become aware of information regarding the sexual abuse of children. An obvious but important point to make is that we must now put as much focus as possible on what happens when such a report is made to the Garda Síochána and how that is handled.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> Two points in the report stood out as a cause of concern. First, the report alleged that 65% of reported crimes of the abuse of children were not recorded properly. In an analysis of a group of sample cases of reported abuse within the Dublin area, it appears that a very small number of those cases had the correct documents completed detailing the responsibility of the Health Service Executive and the responsibility of the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> We are making great strides forward in clarifying the role of people who have this information and their duty in that regard. The Minister has already acknowledged the recommendations in that report such as the need to have an Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for this area and ensuring that any reported cases go directly to trained detectives. I ask that we would make progress as quickly as possible in implementing those recommendations to ensure that the important developments in the Bill can be meaningfully implemented on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> The second point concerns the issue of reasonable excuse in the Bill, which is the number of conditions upon which somebody who has information on the abuse of a child can be given an excuse by the law not to have brought forward that information. As the Bill winds its way through the Oireachtas, I ask that we refine and give thought to the meaning of that condition of reasonable excuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I am conscious that so many of the cases of child abuse that take place are perpetrated by people known to the victim and with whom they already have a relationship. It is important to refine the concept of "reasonable excuse" to ensure the Bill is properly implemented and does not provide any loopholes that can be exploited in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> With regard to the role of the HSE, I am aware the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, will bring forward Children First legislation shortly. I urge that both Bills are co-ordinated so that we do not find ourselves in a situation where somebody aware of information reports it to the HSE but then finds himself or herself open to sanction because of the implementation of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> I thank Deputy Áine Collins for allowing me in to speak at this time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AineCollins" eId="spk_477">
          <from>Deputy Áine Collins<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_760">I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The Bill introduces a change to the criminal justice legislation to make it an offence to withhold information in respect of sexual offences. Every Member of the House and of society now insists that everything possible that can be done to protect children must be done. This Bill is just one small step in advancing that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is making every effort possible to ensure that children are protected in society. She has done an excellent job so far and is dedicated to doing everything that is legally and administratively possible to achieve this. She has consulted widely and has been preparing for the children's rights referendum, which the Tánaiste announced will be held in the autumn as a stand alone referendum. Every party and Member is committed to achieving this, but the issues are complex. I was pleased to hear Mary O'Rourke praise the Minister on her work since coming into office on "Morning Ireland" recently. I would like to thank Mary O'Rourke for the work she did as Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children. That committee worked hard examining all the issues and submissions from interested parties. The proposed wording for an amendment from the committee was agreed by all parties, but the issue is complex. Balancing the rights of children and the rights of parents is complex, as is introducing any new wording into our Constitution. It is vital to get it right. However, we cannot continue pondering the wording forever. For that reason, the Tánaiste's announcement on timing is welcome. I noted from Mary O'Rourke's comments that she, as former Chair of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, would be available if the Minister needed her in any capacity. She also went on to express the view, which I am sure is correct, that Fianna Fáil would do everything possible to facilitate the Government in its efforts to produce a wording for Dáil approval which would then be put to the people in the referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> This Bill is a stepping stone towards providing greater protection to children, as well as vulnerable adults. Under the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, it is an offence to withhold information in respect of serious criminal offences. However, as the Minister has stated, the provision of the 1998 Act specifically excludes sexual offences. This Bill now ensures there will be an obligation on persons who have knowledge of serious offence, including sexual offences against children or vulnerable adults, to inform the Garda. The loophole must be closed. It is arguable that had this provision been included in the original Bill, many children who subsequently became victims of abuse might have been protected. It is important to note that this Bill makes it an offence for every individual to withhold information, not just those involved in organisations, be they clerical, voluntary or State. It is an offence across the board. That said, there is a provision of which the public should be aware. It is not an offence if a citizen does not inform the Garda of vague rumours, innuendo or suspicions. This provision is included to prevent malicious rumours affecting innocent people. However, people with knowledge should always err on the side of caution and of the child. If people have concerns, they should report them to the HSE. It is important that the enactment of the Bill does not put undue pressure on the victims. Subsection (3) deals with this problem. A victim covered by the Bill cannot be guilty of the offence of withholding information if he or she does not report the offence to the Garda. It follows from this that a person who does not report the offence at the specific request of the victim has a legitimate defence. </p>
          <p eId="para_763"> The Minister has explained that the Bill has been drafted to complement the formation of the upcoming Children First Bill and the National Vetting Bureau Bill. The Bill demonstrates the separate and distinct roles of the Garda Síochána and the HSE. The role of the HSE concerns the protection of children and the Garda is the only authority that can investigate a criminal offence against a child. The protection of children must be central.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> Last week's report from the independent child death review group highlights how bad the situation is with regard to dealing with children's issues here. We are all aware of that, but we must now stop talking and do something about it. I listened with interest to Dan O'Brien on the radio on Sunday and was struck by something he said. He questioned how the number of deaths of children in the care of the State compared with the numbers in other countries. I understand there are no comparative statistics. We do not know if the deaths in the care of the State are three times higher than elsewhere or lower. We need to find out in order to be able to measure or benchmark our figures. We also need to look at how other countries tackle the issue. We must examine what they do and consider how we can apply the lesson and make the needed changes. We did this in the case of road deaths and the number of deaths has dropped significantly over the years. We must do the same for the children in our care.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> I am confident that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is so determined to get this right that she will consider these suggestions. This Bill is only one component in the Government's efforts to protect children. It is important that individual citizens understand their obligations under the Bill and that the HSE and the Garda ensure its provisions are upheld. I have no hesitation in recommending the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_766">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill 2012. The Bill deals strongly with the withholding of information on these offences. I will support this important Bill which is part of an overall strategy to protect children and defend their rights as citizens of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> In recent days we have seen more evidence of the abuse of children and deaths of children while in the care of the State. This was appalling and lack of action on the matter is not an option. This is not just a matter for the State or the HSE as we all have a duty to defend and protect the rights of children. In the past, too many people looked the other way, but they must now accept they have a personal responsibility. We must also consider the issues of abuse of alcohol and hard drugs. As we speak, too many children are suffering or are in pain because of the abuse of drugs or alcohol. Imagine the pain and anguish of a three or five year old child living in a home where alcohol or drugs are the norm or where violence is part of their daily life. How can we expect children living in such horrific conditions to be normal? How can we expect those children to learn at school when their personal lives are in turmoil? As a former primary school teacher, I have seen such children and have witnessed their pain, tears and hurt on a daily basis. The sad reality is that this is a cycle that continues and many of the children end up in care or in jail later in life. It is for that reason we need and I support legislation such as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Children in crisis need early intervention. They need care, support and above all stability. Stability is key. Children placed in stable homes, foster homes or proper care situations can be rescued if this is done early. I will return to this later but will deal first with the legislation itself. The Bill establishes in Irish law an offence of withholding information with regard to specified offences committed against a child or vulnerable person. </p>
          <p eId="para_769">The offence arises where a person knows or believes that a specified offence has been committed against a child or vulnerable person and he or she has information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of that other person for the offence and fails without reasonable excuse to disclose that information, as soon as it is practicable, to a member of the Garda Síochána. This is what the legislation is about and there are no ifs or buts about it. The Bill also provides for several offences against a charge of withholding information.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> The Bill makes an amendment to the withholding of information offence in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. The use of the word "children" is important. It is clearly stated in the legislation that a child is a person under 18 years of age. This is crucial because as well as young child abuse there is a high percentage of abuse occurring at teenage level between 12 and 17 years of age. This is why I welcome the fact that a child is defined as being under 18 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> A schedule 2 offence is an offence listed in Schedule 2 to the Bill. This Schedule refers to an offence to withhold information where such offences are committed against a vulnerable person. It is important to concentrate on the phrase "vulnerable person". There are many cases involving normal and natural children but there are other cases involving children and adults with an intellectual disability and we must be extra protective of these people. A vulnerable person is defined in the legislation as "a person who is suffering from either a mental, intellectual or physical disability which is of such a nature as to severely restrict the capacity of that person". It is important that this is stated clearly in the Bill. When dealing with children with a disability or children at risk, it is important to have examples of good practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> We can have all the legislation in the world but if people on the front line are not doing their job efficiently then the cracks will emerge and we have seen this in the past. A good social worker, member of the Garda Síochána or primary school teacher can do a great deal of good and have a major impact. I have seen this in my previous job when I worked in a disadvantaged school in a disadvantaged area. I have seen juvenile liaison officers, JLOs, good social workers and good teachers intervene early in situations involving four and five year old children to assist the families. Often we hear about the bad and sad cases and those who slipped through the net but we do not hear of the cases involving examples of good practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> There was a debate earlier in the year about DEIS programme schools. The Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Education and Skills should consider examples of good practice in many of these DEIS programme schools. Some of these schools are doing an excellent job and I have seen this at first hand. Often front line teachers, special needs assistants and care workers who have a strong relationship with the local juvenile liaison officer from the Garda Síochána have intervened quickly and these people have been supportive in resolving these issues. It is important to mention these people in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> Section 2(3) confirms that a child against whom the specified offence is committed shall not be guilty of an offence under this section. This defence will continue to apply even when the person is no longer a child. This is important. Section 3 deals with the offence of withholding information on certain offences against vulnerable persons. This section replicates the provisions of section 2 and applies them to specified offences committed against vulnerable persons. The specified offences which apply under this section are listed in Schedule 2 to the Bill. This is crucial as well. We must be creative, radical and preventative when it comes to these issues. We have all heard of clerical and institutional abuse but we must deal with situations in which paedophiles adapt to the changing situation and do so cleverly. People involved in the caring sections of Irish society, whether in education or supporting children and adults with an intellectual disability, must be strong and protective of the children.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> A debate took place recently on the number of children who have died in State care. There is an understandable questioning of the report into the deaths of children while in the care of the HSE. I know from first-hand experience and from discussing the matter with people who care for young people with difficulties that many of those involved can see the problems coming down the tracks when the children arrive in their homes and when they arrive in the institutions. Many of those working in these areas can foresee the problems and often feel powerless. This is the sad reality of the care business.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Often, by the time the HSE intervenes to try to protect young persons entrusted to it, it is too late. This is the sad reality but it is not trendy or fashionable to say as much in the debate. Some of these casualties may already be beyond saving by the time the State is called in to take them under its control. It should come as no surprise that many somehow manage to escape into meaningful adulthood. The other extreme is where some of these children have come through horrific situations but manage to survive and come out at the other end. This is something that has not been recognised in the broader debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> I put it to the Minister for Justice and Equality that early intervention is central and it represents the real solution. Often, by the time a child reaches 12 years of age it is too late. The front line care workers and primary school teachers will testify to this. I taught sixth class and I saw children at risk from aged 12 or 13 years of age. We had a considerable job to try to prevent them from ending up on drugs, on the streets or in Mountjoy Prison. If one intervenes early, at least one can do something. The whole ground has changed in recent years and people have accepted this. The Minister for Justice and Equality accepts it, as does the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Minister for Education and Skills. Early intervention is central to dealing with this issue. This is based not on windy research but on the reality and the experience of people involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> I referred to the children who make it. I have witnessed examples of children of 12 or 13 years of age who are living in crisis families and who are looking after smaller children of four and five years of age. These people are amazing. I have seen young boys and girls dressing their four and five year old brothers and sisters to get them to school in the morning. They must do so because of a particular dysfunction or crisis situation in the family. These children need our support as much as the direct victims. The carers of these children are often children themselves. Sometimes the carers are grandmothers and grandfathers who are supportive as well. I have seen children whose parents were strung out on drugs. These children were left in school until 2.30 p.m. or 3 p.m. and were not collected by their parents. The grandmother and grandfather were contacted by the school and they came to rescue the children. I am keen to mention these people in the debate because it is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Those of us on the left often refer to poverty and the neglect of children. Let us consider the reality. Often poor children from stable families will get on in life and I have seen this at first hand. Children from dysfunctional families, however, or families riddled with crime, alcohol or drug abuse, often end up in a difficult situation. How can we expect a two year old or a five year old child to be normal where there is violence and intimidation going on? One need only visit the courts on any given day to see the horrific nightmare in which children live with cocaine-fuelled families and high levels of violence. It is important to deal with the issue of children in crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Institutions are important as well. We have modernised our institutions and care services. There are many excellent care services including St Michael's House and Prosper Fingal Services in Swords which deal with children and adults with an intellectual disability. These services have implemented their own good practices and they carry out a remarkable job.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> I pay tribute to another group of people, namely, the foster parents of the country. These parents deliver considerable stability to families. They are Irish patriots and they have served their country. They receive some money to help fostered children but they also stop children going into institutions and they save many children. The work of the vast majority of foster parents is remarkable and I take this opportunity while the Minister for Justice and Equality is in the House to pay tribute to them. They have delivered for the taxpayer and the State. More important, the vast majority of them have delivered for the children of the country.</p>

          <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_784">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> I welcome this opportunity to present the Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill 2012 to the House. The Bill is one of the key targeted initiatives in the Government's action plan for jobs 2012 to address access to credit and support lending to microenterprises, which are the most vulnerable cohort of our SME sector. I believe it will prove to be a practical way of facilitating additional lending to microenterprises across all industry sectors in the locally traded and the exporting sectors. A large number of our microenterprises are locally owned businesses that give their owners enough income to support their families and contribute to their localities. No glamour or particular riches are attached but they are the true heart and soul of Irish business and the Government firmly intends to support them. The microenterprise sector encompasses everyone from the corner shop newsagents, the mechanic, the solicitor, the accountant and the window cleaner to the coffee shop owner, the hairdresser and the small scale ICT player. The aim of this Bill is to facilitate lending to microenterprises and thereby help sustainable small businesses to generate jobs and return the economy to the long term growth path which was destroyed by the poor economic policies of the recent past.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> Microfinance Ireland is being established to provide loans to sustainable microenterprises in these difficult times. It is targeted at newly established or growing enterprises across all industry sectors with commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial banks. It is part of the suite of initiatives being implemented by the Government to get the economy moving again and transform the country to meet the Taoiseach's objective of making Ireland the best small country in the world to do business in by 2016. It is through initiatives like microenterprise loan fund that we will achieve our goal and provide sustainable employment for our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> I will now explain the rationale for introducing a microenterprise loan fund. In February the Government launched a range of measures under the action plan for jobs aimed at improving the competitiveness of the economy, improving supports for job creating businesses and removing barriers to employment creation across the economy. Every Department and over 35 agencies and offices of the State are engaged in developing actions to support jobs which will delivered in this calendar year. The plan is an active engine for change which be reviewed and revitalised every year. The introduction of the microenterprise loan fund is one of the key commitments that my Department made in order to deliver positive and speedy results for this sector. The objective of the fund is to facilitate additional lending into the economy and create jobs in the microenterprise sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> The formation and growth of microenterprises are critically dependent on access to credit. In the current risk averse lending environment access to credit is restricted for all businesses and this is particularly acute in the microenterprise sector. Even in good economic circumstances, banks decline applications from the sector if they do not meet their criteria even though the applicants may have proven creditworthy had the loan been granted. Factors that have discouraged banks from lending to microenterprises include: poorly compiled records and accounts, especially audited accounts; low levels of technical and management skills; high bad debt levels; lack of collateral; the administrative overheads and time investments required in terms of loan assessment, often with high refusal rates; and the relatively small size of lending proposition, with loans averaging €16,000. </p>
          <p eId="para_789"> To support the recovery we need to find ways to ensure that creditworthy borrowers have access to lending. It is important, however, that I make it patently clear that the microenterprise loan fund is not intended to replace current bank lending. The banks constitute the first port of call and lender of first choice for loan applicants. Indeed, applicants will be required to confirm that they have been refused finance by a bank before their applications to this fund are considered. Microenterprises applying for loans under the fund can be in the form of a sole trader, partnership or private limited company with up to ten employees. Loans will be less than €25,000 and can be used for any business purpose. Loan applications will be made on the standard loan application form as agreed with the Irish Banking Federation and must be supported by a viable business plan indicating repayment capacity. Support in developing business plans will be made available through the county enterprise boards and local enterprise offices, which will also assist small companies to professionalise their engagement with institutions and access much needed finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> The fund is targeted at start-up, newly established and growing microenterprises across all industry sectors which employ no more than ten people. It will provide loans of up to €25,000 for commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial banks. This will afford entrepreneurs a real opportunity to get started and support the creation of new jobs linked to new fledgling businesses and expansion of established businesses. It is intended that the fund will provide loans to some 5,500 microenterprises and generate close to 8,000 jobs over ten years at a cost of approximately €2,500 per job. This is extremely good value in any man’s language, particularly when one factors in the gains to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> I have chosen the Social Finance Foundation to manage and control the fund on my behalf. For transparency purposes it shall establish a dedicated subsidiary, microfinance Ireland, MFI, and run the loan book attached to the fund. This will minimise overall management costs, which have traditionally been high for microfinance. It will also ensure clear financial and accounting structures, enhance the possibility of European Investment Fund guarantee assistance and allow for clear accountability on the costs of running the scheme. MFI will work with other key stakeholders, including county enterprise boards and local enterprise offices, to deliver a comprehensive microenterprise service to potential clients. The Social Finance Foundation has a track record in the area of microfinance and will leverage this to deliver optimal outcomes for the State in this important area.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> To underline the importance that I attach to an initiative for this sector, an allocation of €10 million will be made available as seed capital for the fund. In the current climate this is a clear indication of the importance that the Government attaches to this dynamic sector. When viewed in a macroeconomic context, microfinance is a very cost effective job creation and protection mechanism which generates a high rate of return. In many cases the would be entrepreneurs come from the ranks of the unemployed and draw State benefits. Existing employees who choose the entrepreneurial route and set up their own business are also likely to create a residual employment opportunity in their previous organisation. The vast majority of microfinance applicants are engaged in locally traded services. While many may not have the potential for growth in terms of internationally traded businesses, there are significant benefits in the development of a successful microenterprise sector because it provides a solid enterprise base from which the SMEs and high potential start-ups of the future can develop. There are clear societal and community benefits in addition to the economic and job creation objectives as individuals grow in confidence, generate positive internalities throughout the community and provide much needed competition in the locally traded sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> In addition to contributing to the economic and social agenda, this initiative will also yield Exchequer gains in terms of employment creation, savings on welfare payments and increased direct and indirect tax payments, which are calculated at €23,000 per job per annum. The €10 million allocation, supplemented by €15 million borrowed from other sources in tranches of €5 million over years two, three and four of the lifetime of the fund, will generate €40 million in loan expenditure and create 3,800 jobs over a five year period. This is based on €8.8 million in loan demand and 20% in bad debts. The return to the Exchequer over five years is estimated at €46.2 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> I will now address the specific provisions of the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_795">Section 1 provides for the Short Title, the Microenterprise Loan Fund Act 2012, and commencement. Section 2 defines certain commonly used terms in the Bill. Section 3 provides that costs associated with administering the Act will be subject to sanction from the Minister for Finance, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and will be met from moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 4 provides for the establishment of the microenterprise loan fund. The fund shall consist of all grants made to the subsidiary under section 5 and all gifts and other income.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> Section 5 confers on the Minister the power to pay to the subsidiary €10 million, and provides scope for additional Exchequer funding if deemed necessary subject to an absolute cap of €25 million before further Oireachtas approval is required. Section 6 provides for the subsidiary to invest money from the fund and to vary or sell investments made. Section 7 enables the subsidiary to lend money to microenterprises using existing moneys and money borrowed from the Social Finance Foundation. Section 8 provides for the Social Finance Foundation to be able to borrow money for the purposes of this Act. The aggregate of borrowings under this section at any one time shall not exceed €25 million. Section 9 allows for the Minister, the Social Finance Foundation or the subsidiary, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to accept a gift of moneys - the purpose of the making of which is to benefit the fund - upon such trusts or conditions, if any, as may be specified by the donor.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> Section 10 provides for the Minister to make a scheme. The scheme may make provision for various terms and conditions such as purposes for which the loan may be given, terms of the loan agreements, reports and information by the subsidiary to the Minister, audit and examination of accounts of the subsidiary, and other matters. Section 11 enables the Social Finance Foundation to form a subsidiary, to be registered under the Companies Acts. Section 12 provides for the name and share capital of the subsidiary, of €1, and that share shall be issued by the subsidiary to the Social Finance Foundation. Section 13 provides for the memorandum and articles of association to be consistent with the Act and to be approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> Section 14 provides for a director of the subsidiary to be disqualified for various issues such as bankruptcy, conviction of an offence, and other matters. Section 15 provides for directors to cease to be a director if they are nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann or elected as a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, or the European Parliament. Section 16 provides for the disclosure of interests by directors of the subsidiary. Section 17 provides for the disclosure of interests by members of staff of the subsidiary. Section 18 provides for the non-disclosure of confidential information by any person serving as a director or staff member, adviser or consultant to the subsidiary. </p>
          <p eId="para_799"> Section 19 provides for the funding of the subsidiary out of moneys in the fund and allows the Minister to make an arrangement related to the expenditure generally incurred by the subsidiary in the performance of its functions under this Act. Section 20 sets out requirements for accounts to be kept by the subsidiary and provides for auditing by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Section 21 provides for an annual report to be prepared by the subsidiary and to lay the report before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 22 provides for the Minister to conduct a review of the operation of the Act not later than two years after the date of its passing. This is designed to ensure that we have introduced a programme of relevance to this business sector that achieves results and delivers on our key outcome area of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> Backing microenterprise by providing finance to those who struggle to get credit from mainstream lenders is deigned to meet a vital need. The development of the sector is not something that we can leave to chance. As can be seen from this and other initiatives, it is not being left to chance. We want to reach out to more people who have the ambition and drive to set up their own small business. This initiative has a significant entrepreneurship focus. Entrepreneurship and self-employment is an important opportunity for individuals. It is important for rewards such as self-worth, self-sufficiency, independence, job satisfaction and increased income. Entrepreneurship is also important for the economy as a whole as it leads to new jobs, and is a catalyst for new innovations for wealth creation. Entrepreneurship keeps the economy fresh and moving forward. The fund will help turn good ideas into great jobs. Across the country we have ideas and fantastically talented people. We must encourage entrepreneurs, particularly young people, to develop ideas into business opportunities. Entrepreneurs are attracted by the prospect of success and need to be encouraged and supported to make their mark and build a better future for themselves and this country. Entrepreneurs who utilise this fund will also have to make the best possible use of professional advice provided through bodies such as county enterprise boards, which are soon to become local enterprise offices. They will have to build on their skills and this can only heighten the professionalism of the sector. This, in turn, will lead to greater demand for professional services, further increasing the benefits to the economy of the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> Ultimately, profitable and competitive businesses will underpin job creation, prosperity and the broader success of the economy. This fund is an example of how we are taking action to ensure the business environment supports this agenda. The initiative is another step towards a more sophisticated and accessible financing environment for small business in Ireland, and is just one component in the suite of initiatives aimed at ensuring the flow of credit. It will add value to the measures already taken to address the SME credit supply issue such as the temporary partial loan guarantee scheme and represents real value for money to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> Despite the difficulties in the economy, we continue to have a high-level of business start-ups. We are among the highest in Europe for business start-ups but the constraint is access to credit. Even if the banks were in the whole of their health, this would be a problem. Deputy Peadar Tóibín is not in the Chamber at present but he has often raised the question of why we are not availing of the European Investment Fund and its capacity to guarantee independent credit providing institutions. The reason we have not drawn down that funding sufficiently in the past is that we have not had a nationwide fund of this nature filling the gap.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> I pay tribute to the officials who have worked tirelessly to develop this, and the co-operation received from other Departments. I also pay tribute to the co-operation received from the Social Finance Foundation and First Step, which has pioneering experience in this area. The initiative will be really worthwhile but it is not the solution to our jobs challenges. It recognises an important niche in job creation that is underserved by the facilities currently in place. It will provide a new weapon in the armoury of our county enterprise boards and local enterprise offices as they seek to create a stronger business environment in local communities. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_482">
          <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_804">Jonathan Swift said "Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed." The Bill has been a long time in gestation. If I regale the House with the occasions on which the measure was promised, we would sit well into August and would have time for nothing else. I will provide a few brief examples. In May 2011 a statement emanating from the Department said, "a workable scheme and optimum delivery mechanisms are now being considered and this work will be brought to fruition for the December Budget". In November 2011, the Government press office stated that the"Government announced details of a €100 million Micro Finance Loan Fund which impact 5,000 businesses and will be in place in the first quarter of 2012". In budget 2012, the Minister for Finance stated that the loan fund was agreed and about to come into existence. In February 2012, accompanying the Government action plan on jobs, there was a statement to the effect that the €100 million microfinance loan scheme will go live shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> Like the Credit Guarantee Bill, the legislation is an enabling Bill and provides that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, has been given the right to devise a scheme. The scheme it is not incorporated into the Bill and we have no idea what is in the scheme. We are totally in the dark about such vital elements as the classes of enterprises covered, the activities covered by the loans and whether any restrictions apply, what accounts will be kept by the enterprises, the amount of bureaucracy involved in impeding the scheme, the rate of interest and where people apply. If we tell people the scheme will be in operation by the autumn, the first question they will ask is where they should go.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">I will return to that point. We do know, however, from the terms of the Government's press release - it is not in the Bill but in the press briefing - that it will only apply to applicants who have first been refused by the banks. I take the Minister's point about not complementing or overlapping with the banks in terms of lending. Nevertheless, the requirement to establish that a refusal has issued from the bank could potentially make the scheme very restrictive. We will deal with that on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> The Minister mentioned in his speech and in the various press releases that the Government is allocating a particular sum under the scheme and that another amount will be leverage against that. Will he outline exactly how this will work? It is not immediately clear to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> The scheme is being introduced against the backdrop of record unemployment. As we speak, a meeting I organised to discuss youth unemployment is taking place elsewhere in Leinster House. I hope to make an appearance before it is finished. Youth unemployment is currently running at 30%. According to the International Labour Organisation, ILO, report issued in October 2011, the real figure is probably more than 50%, with only Spain and Greece in a worse position. The ILO is of the view that the extent of youth unemployment in this country is significantly understated, with a huge cohort of young people "hiding out" in the education system and in training schemes. It is not just the level of youth unemployment or the overall unemployment figures that are a cause for concern - in fact, the pattern that is emerging is extremely disconcerting. Of the huge numbers of unemployed, more than half have been out of work for more than a year and more than one third for more than two years. That is a very serious situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> We must also build into these statistics the figures in regard to emigration. The official data, in so far as they can gauge, indicate that 75,000 people have left the country in the past 12 months. Simple mathematics will show that this equates to more than 200 per day. While the initial wave of emigration consisted largely of foreigners who had come to the country in recent years either as asylum seekers or in possession of work permits, an increasing proportion is made up of well educated Irish nationals. EUROSTAT figures show that Ireland's emigration rate is by far the highest in the European Union and double that of our nearest competitor, Lithuania. The Minister for Finance expressed the view some time ago that people were leaving in order to see Ayers Rock, Niagara Falls and the other wonders of the world. I know many families who have been affected by emigration and, in every case, the reason for leaving was the person's inability to secure employment in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> The most significant difference between the emigration that is happening now and that of the early 1980s is the volume of skilled workers leaving our shores on a daily basis. In addition to the social upheaval emigration causes, the loss of so many skilled individuals has consequences for the long-term productive capacity of the economy and the dependency ratio. Social Justice Ireland has correctly noted that, "The emigration 'brain drain' which in some quarters is being heralded perversely as a 'safety valve' is in fact a serious problem for Ireland and may well lead to a skills deficit in the long term". That would have serious negative implications for this country, including in the matter of attracting foreign direct investment. We remain marooned in a crisis of unemployment and emigration. Everybody in this House, regardless of political ideology, knows the effects of unemployment. It corrodes social cohesion, shatters communities, destroys relationships, crushes hope and engenders despair. It has driven many people, both young and old, up to and beyond the limits of their endurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> I concede that the Government has made some efforts to deal with the crisis, but there is a certain incoherence to its approach. I am reminded of the dog who, when he eventually caught up with the car he was chasing. did not know what to do with it. There is also a remarkable media phenomenon to contend with. Unemployment is the greatest scourge and social evil confronting this country, but there is a distinct lack of media coverage of that reality. Deputy Mick Wallace's tax affairs generated far more acres of media coverage than the unemployment crisis that is tearing away at the very heart of this country. The people who cut turf in the west and are represented by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan are very important people and undoubtedly an important part of their local economy. It beggars belief, however, that their plight has attracted more media coverage than that of the 500,000 unemployed and the 200 leaving every day. The entire agenda is tilted in favour of covering the travails of the turf cutters.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> One of the most respected young economists writing in the media today is Stephen Kinsella, a lecturer at the University of Limerick. I am not being partisan in stating my great admiration for him. He summed up this phenomenon very well in a recent article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_813">Journalists respond to sharp changes in data series. A sharp tick up, a sharp tick down would get this story on the news. Or a major jobs announcement or the withdrawal of a large number of jobs. But that's it. The persistence of the problem is what is being lost.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_814"> Recent research collected for the European Parliament has shown [the] costs [of unemployment] include shame and stigma, increased social isolation, crime, erosion of confidence and of self-esteem, the atrophying of vital work skills, and potentially ill-health, financial hardship and poverty, increases in personal debt, homelessness and housing stress, family tensions and marital breakdown, boredom and alienation,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_815"> Most of these problems increase markedly with the duration of unemployment, and in Ireland there are an estimated 182,000 people [this figure is slightly out of date] unemployed for more than 12 months. Unemployed people report that being unemployed was one of the worst things that has happened to them in their lives. And yet this isn't news.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> This is the backdrop to the legislation we are debating. Ours is not a centrally planned economy and we depend on business, large and small, to generate jobs. Vital to the proper working of that system is an adequate provision of credit. Credit is the lifeblood of business, without which it cannot operate. When he recapitalised the banks, the Minister for Finance observed that he had stuffed them with capital. That was done not because they are venerable institutions or national monuments or because they deserve to be preserved for themselves. They were stuffed with capital in order to ensure their survival and thus their capacity to lend into the productive economy and facilitate the creation of jobs for the people of this country. They have failed abysmally to keep their side of the bargain.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> As a result, the Government is reduced to introducing fairly minor, minimalist and targeted gestures to relieve the situation. We have had a series of Orwellian announcements from the banks, including statements, reports, studies, dispatches and miscellaneous other propaganda, all seeking to compel us to ignore the evidence before us. They keep telling us that lending is normal and there is no credit flow problem. The net effect of all this propaganda is, as Orwell put it, to "give an appearance of solidity to pure wind". Apart from the anecdotal evidence, the official evidence is unusually compelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">For example, on 5 June last, the head of the Credit Review Office, Mr. John Trethowan, eventually had to admit he was disappointed that there was not more support for enterprise and risk taking, as a result of new and increased lending by banks. William Butler Yeats used the phrase "peace comes dropping slow", but for some people in the public sector reality seems to come dropping even slower. I am glad, however, that the head of the Credit Review Office has at last recognised the daily reality before our eyes. </p>
          <p eId="para_819"> Professor Patrick Honohan, the Governor of the Central Bank was far less circumspect. On 1 March this year, he said Ireland was the most difficult country in the eurozone for small businesses to access credit. He stated bluntly that credit was not flowing as freely in Ireland as in other EU countries. He said, "Credit conditions for SMEs are tougher in Ireland than anywhere else in the euro area, both in terms of cost and availability". That is a pretty stark judgment from the Governor of the Central Bank .</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> A recent EU survey on access to finance in the euro area, found that Irish SMEs were the second least successful in obtaining credit, after Greece. It examined factors such as the likelihood of being rejected for a loan, the size of loans, the level of collateral required to secure loans, commissions and fees, and the interest rate charged. All of those factors were found to be "substantially less favourable in Ireland than in the euro area generally". </p>
          <p eId="para_821"> A recent survey by ISME published on 12 March, found that 91% of firms felt banks were making it more difficult, rather than easier, to access credit. </p>
          <p eId="para_822"> A Central Bank paper by Dr. Fergal McCann, which studied and analysed bank lending for the first nine months of 2011, found that while an extra €1.6 billion was loaned into the SME sector of the economy, during the same period the banks removed €2.4 billion credit by closing credit facilities. Therefore, real lending to SMEs in this period was minus €800 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> Together with those in Greece, Irish SMEs are the least successful in obtaining credit according to the EU survey on access to finance in the euro area. The Government has responded on a number of fronts. A small amount of money was allocated to the development fund for medium-sized and larger companies. A relatively small amount of money was dedicated to the innovation fund, and in addition there is the credit guarantee scheme and the microenterprise loan fund scheme. However, if the banks do not lend properly into the economy all of this will not begin to scratch the surface. Let me put it in context. The total amount of outstanding credit to SMEs is about €60 billion. The target for the two recapitalised pillar banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, for a two-year period was €3 billion per annum each. That is €12 billion extra funding over a two-year period. We are talking here about €10 million over a number of years, which is like the little Dutch boy with his finger in the dyke. </p>
          <p eId="para_824"> In the Government's press release and again in the Minister's speech, it is claimed that this will create 7,700 jobs over a ten-year period. What is the basis for that claim and how has that figure been measured? Was it just picked from the air or is there any logical, scientific explanation? If so, how has it been calculated? I know those matters are, to a certain extent, dependent on opinion but what analysis has been done? </p>
          <p eId="para_825"> Even if we assume that it achieves its target of 8,000 jobs over ten years, to be generous, that is 800 per year. I have already made the point that emigration is running at over 200 per day, so the yearly target for the amount of jobs to be created here will cover about 3.5 days' emigration. The ten-year target figure will cover about one month's emigration at current rates. I am not saying this in order to belittle the Government's efforts but just to put the matter in context; we are not even beginning to scratch the surface.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> I would like the Minister to address a number of questions in his reply. First, is it intended that the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will be able to debate this scheme before it comes into effect? I have no intention of delaying it. </p>
          <p eId="para_827"> Second, when does the Minister envisage that it will come into effect?</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> Third, to whom must one apply in order to avail of the scheme? Will it be some central agency in Dublin or will it be done locally? Can it be done through county enterprise boards or the new one-stop-shops as they will become? If the administrative costs are not too high, this should be done locally or at a very minimum regionally. Many people are interested in this scheme and they have asked me how it will be administered. We do not have a clue so all I can tell them is that the legislation is going through the Dáil, which will give the Minister the right to set up a scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> I wish to raise a technical point with the Minister. What are the civil consequences for directors of the lending company who fail to disclose a material interest? They are obligated to disclose a material interest and there are certain statutory consequences set out in the Bill, but what will the civil consequences be? For example, will they be liable for damages and, if so, how will those damages be measured?</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> Section 18 prohibits disclosure of confidential information by directors and staff of the lending agency, but the section does not seem to contain any sanction to be applied when people disclose such information. Where is the sanction therefore? </p>
          <p eId="para_831"> Section 22 provides for a review of the operation of the scheme within two years of its commencement. However, there is no time limit for this review and there is no obligation for the review to be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas for the purposes of debate. </p>
          <p eId="para_832"> Those are a small number of queries I had for the Minister, but I will turn to more detailed matters on Committee Stage. I welcome anything that gets €1 of extra credit into the economy. While the potato famine destroyed the social and economic fabric of this country 170 years ago, it is now being destroyed by a credit famine. I will therefore support anything that tends to get extra credit into the economy. I am not opposing the Bill but I deeply regret its shortcomings and limitations. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeadarToibin" eId="spk_483">
          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_833">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Bille seo ós comhair na Dála inniu. The legislation has been a long time coming. When the Government took office, the European progress microfinance fund was created simultaneously. The fund is open to all European countries and, at the last count, 11 countries had drawn down money from it, including Bulgaria.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> In the 16 months since the Government took office, roughly 2,064 companies have gone bust - not to mention the number of sole traders that have lost their businesses. While it is hard to believe, in the last week alone, 27 companies have closed per working day. A large proportion of these are closing because demand has fallen off and there is a lack of credit. Not included in those figures are business start-ups that were sole traders or potential business start-ups that were stillborn. They were stillborn due to lack of demand and credit. </p>
          <p eId="para_835">Many of these former entrepreneurs, some of whom never got started, are languishing and struggling on the dole trying to make ends meet or are scattered across the four corners of the world, probably utilising their skills to the benefit of other economies.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> Prior to my election as a representative of the people of Meath West, I worked over a seven year period with approximately 2,000 microenterprises throughout Ireland, North and South and in Scotland. These businesses are the engine of the economy. They are not the headline grabbing businesses like foreign direct investment but they account for the vast majority of businesses in our economy. They are rooted in all of our communities. Every corner of this State is dependent upon these businesses, which are made up of sole traders, craft workers and local retailers, who are, beyond any shadow of doubt, suffering. Many business owners in order that they will not have to let people go are not taking wages. They are doing their damnedest to get their businesses through this hard time without having to let go good staff, many of whom have been working for them for 20 and 30 years. This can only happen for so long. As each month passes, many are going to the wall. </p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Of the 195,000 private enterprises in this State, 99.8% are in the SME sector and account for 70% of employment. The vast majority of these microenterprises are sole traders and employers of fewer than ten people. They are the backbone of the Irish economy. It is on this sector that we need to focus much of what we do. Much of the talk in this Chamber since this Government took office has been about foreign direct investment, which employs fewer people than do microenterprises even though it accounts for a far larger proportion of the economy in terms of output. The vast bulk of our microenterprises are suffering because of demand and the freeze on lending, both of which are in reality the outworkings of Government policy. These entrepreneurs are highly motivated people. They are individuals who have invested their whole lives and often all of their savings in their businesses. I am often told by individuals that when asked by people when walking down the road how they are getting on they immediately think people are inquiring about their business because they do not differentiate between their businesses, which are struggling, and themselves. The identity of most of these individuals is wrapped up in their businesses</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> Up to now, much of this motivation and energy has been obstructed by a lack of support from the banking sector and some of the business agencies. The first objective of this State is to make the banks deleverage significantly from the economy and, second, to make them lend €6 billion to small businesses. Those two objectives are mutually exclusive. The Government is telling the banks to have less exposure to the economy and to lend more. The reality is that the banking policies of this State are procyclical. They are further deepening the economic trough in which we find ourselves, causing damage to small businesses on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> The sole focus of the banking sector up to 2007 was property loans and development. Bonuses were given to staff who could lend as much as possible to this sector. Skills previously the core of small business have been lost. The lack of support since 2007 for microenterprise and small business has become acute. Despite €64 billion of our money being sunk into the banking system it is failing the economy. I recall the previous Taoiseach saying that the purpose of the blanket guarantee was to ensure we had a banking sector that functioned and served the economy. Yet, in 2012 we still do not have a banking sector that is properly functioning or serving the real economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> ECB data indicates that businesses operating in the south of Ireland are between 15% and 18% more likely to have a request for credit rejected. That is 15% to 18% higher than the European average. I believe the true figure is greater. Despite the rhetoric of "Not one more red cent" this Government continues to pump money into the banks and to be powerless to direct the banks, which it owns, to function in the public interest. This process is happening throughout Europe. Last week, €100 billion was put into the Spanish banks. This money will be used to pay off bond holders and to recapitalise the banks, which, owing to their paranoia about their capitalisation levels, will withdraw from functioning with the real economy, which is exactly what happened in this State. The European Union is persisting with this extremely detrimental economic policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> On behalf of Sinn Féin I have continually called for the establishment of a microenterprise fund. We welcomed the programme for Government commitment to the establishment of a €100 million microfinance start-up fund, in addition to the establishment of a working and effective banking sector. What we have now is a €10 million fund in an attempt to offset our banking shortcomings. While we welcome this initiative, the sum provided is shockingly low. Given the scale of demand in this area an initial fund of €10 million will not be sufficient. We believe far more should be done within the lifetime of this Government to fully achieve the €100 million fund as set out in programme of Government. It is now a constant theme that this Government promises much but delivers little. What it delivers is always below expectation.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> This legislation and fund have been developed to plug a market failure. Banks are not lending to business. ISME has stated that fewer than 50% of its members requiring credit receive it. This should be addressed directly with the banks. The Minister knows as well as I do that the banks are not lending. Even with a functioning banking sector there would still be a need for some form of microfinance. That is the international experience of institutions in the developing world such as the Grameen Bank. There are other examples across the EU. In looking at the failure of banks to lend for a number of reasons, such as those which I have outlined, it is important to ensure the banks are re-educated about how to lend to small business. The success of the Government in terms of supporting microenterprise hinges on its ability to tackle these issues. No one single initiative will succeed in solving the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> As I stated earlier the Government needs to tackle the banks that have been recapitalised and to address funding to microenterprises. I hope that the Minister will ensure that his plans to close down the county enterprise boards will address the issue of building capacity and support for this sector. The most famous and successful microenterprise programme of which I am aware is the Grameen Bank to which I referred earlier, the focus of which is not only on providing credit to small business but on peer lending. This approach shares risk across a number of small businesses, leading to greater support and mentoring between the peer groups. If a loan is defaulted upon it affects everyone involved in the group. I suggest that the Minister peruse this model of peer lending, which not only delivers credit but provides business support.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> I note that the regulatory impact assessment states that the objective of Microfinance Ireland is to provide loans to start-up, newly established and growing microenterprises. We all accept there is a failure here.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">I am concerned the regulatory impact analysis also makes it explicit that an application to the microenterprise fund must be made after rejection by a bank. I understand the Minister wants this microfinance to be a last resort. He wants the normal economy to function and he does not want to let the banks off the hook with regard to their responsibilities. However, due to the fact the banking system does not have the necessary skills the banks require over the top documentation. While documentation is important and good business plans are pivotal to the development of the business, in my experience sometimes due to their processes banks require too much in this regard. The information is then delivered up the food chain in the bank far too slowly and often the person with the power to make the decision has not read the business plan and will only see an executive summary, or met the entrepreneur because he or she is three or four steps away. Given these problems, it would be beneficial for businesses to be able to apply to the microfinance fund directly. This could be another hurdle in the process of receiving funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> Will the Minister outline the support that will be available to businesses to build their capacity to develop business plans and feasibility studies? The county enterprise boards do some of this work, and I hope the new formation will too but it is important to buttress this aspect of enterprise development at the microenterprise funding stage. Given that these are start-ups and new businesses will the Minister give consideration to the microenterprise fund becoming a first port of call for business? This is not to let the banks of the hook.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> While I note the Minister's intention to develop the fund, from the outset the working and practice of the fund should be based on the needs of microenterprise. It should be microenterprise-centric. In this regard, a point of contact should be established between the microenterprise financing agency and the business to gather information on behalf of the business prior to and after an application is made and for consultation purposes. This would draw on the existing agencies, in particular the enhanced role of Enterprise Ireland. This type of wraparound facility for small businesses, including support and mentoring, could increase the professionalism and feasibility of the initial request for microenterprise funding, strengthen the business and reduce the risk of default in the long run, which is in the interest of the Government and State.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> I am concerned the structure of the microenterprise funding agency is a little convoluted. It could be expensive and may not offer a comprehensive service. I note from the annual report of Social Finance Foundation that it worked with the Department and consulted with stakeholders to develop the proposal that is now under consideration. I do not want to cast aspersions on this fine organisation which has done good work, but I am always concerned when the body consulting on and drafting the proposals will also be the body to deliver it. Often, not in this case directly, it can lead to the researching body writing a role for itself and orienting the programme to include itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> I also note that over the past year the administration costs of Social Finance Foundation doubled without taking on additional roles. I further note that when established, Social Finance Foundation was a provider of wholesale finance and that delivery bodies applied to it to pass on credit. First Step, one of the few organisations that delivers microenterprise funding worked in this regard. My understanding is that the proposals as set out in the legislation and the regulatory impact analysis change the role of Social Finance Foundation from a credit wholesaler to a direct deliverer through the microfinancing agency. Will the Minister clarify the experience and capacity Social Finance Foundation has to deliver this new role? What will be the role of First Step and will the microenterprise funding agency support intermediaries?</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> I seek this clarification not to undermine Social Finance Foundation but to ensure the support available to microenterprises is straight forward, accessible and speedy. While we need more than one provider we do not need a plethora of them, as this would mean excess administration which would confuse businesses and support organisations and draw on the resources of the fund. Will the Minister clarify exactly how the body will be established and accountable? The legislation must ensure there is no potential for lobbying by any elected representative on behalf of a small business. Decisions should be made in a clear cut manner and should be transparent and open for the State to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> The legislation gives the Minister the power to dismiss board members from the microfinance fund, which will be a subsidiary of Social Finance Foundation, but not the power to appoint board members. However the regulatory impact analysis states that the chairperson of the Social Finance Foundation subsidiary, Microfinance Ireland, will be appointed by the Minister who will also approve the board members. Which version is correct, the legislation or the regulatory impact analysis? I hope those appointed to the board are fully independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> The establishment of Microfinance Ireland as a subsidiary of Social Finance Foundation also confuses the issue of operational accountability. As a subsidiary the normal practice is that it would be accountable to the parent company and not another body. The regulatory impact analysis states all governance will be overseen by the Minister. Will the Minister assure us the operation of the board will be fully accountable to the Minister and the Oireachtas? If I have difficulty following the lines of accountability for this process and knowing who is responsible for lending and lending practice where will it leave prospective borrowers and start-ups?</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> Given the need for a clear microenterprise-centric approach, has the Minister given any consideration to developing the fund under Enterprise Ireland or another agency to ensure a one-stop-shop for enterprises which would bring together support, credit and grants? I would welcome the Minister's assessment of the ability of Microfinance Ireland to make an application to the European progress microfinance fund. This fund was established with more than €200 million and has been operational for more than a year. A number of EU countries have drawn down this support</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> The regulatory impact analysis makes a number of assumptions on the roll-out of the fund and these are highly optimistic. Is the Minister confident about this analysis and will he make this the basis of the review of the work of Microfinance Ireland? If the microfinance fund is to meet the needs of microenterprises and redress market failure, loans must be offered a rate that will support business growth. It is maddening that the banking sector can access funds from the ECB at a rate of 1% yet businesses have to go over the odds for support. It is another case where the short-sighted needs of banking are undermining the real economy. There is a need for loan terms to reflect the support and leg up that new businesses require if they are to become sustainable and build employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> Despite these concerns about the length of time it has taken to develop the initiative we welcome it as a positive step in supporting microenterprises. We are mindful of its limitations and the need to resolve them and we look forward to doing so on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_858">This Bill is overdue, but it is also necessary and I welcome it. A public representative very quickly becomes a one-stop shop and I am sure we all have the experience of people calling to our offices every week with ideas. People come to us asking us to whom they should go because they have a very good idea but they do not have the funding to get it off the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">One can send them to a body like a county enterprise board, where mentoring and funding for a business plan or feasibility study are available, but they will run into the difficulty at the next point after that if the option of bank finance is not available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> Many people laugh when it is suggested to them that they could ask a bank for finance. It is the last place where many people would think of going, unfortunately. Many of those who have good ideas are depending on social welfare. In some cases, they have been unemployed for a long time. Their reluctance to approach the banks might be understandable because they do not have the kind of profile that is normally associated with those who are thinking of starting new businesses. I appreciate that this fund is not for the exclusive use of start-up companies. It will also be used to help existing enterprises to grow, which is just as important. The micro-enterprise sector is central to the generation of sustainable growth. This country is not short on ideas. We need to focus on exploiting, or taking further, the great creative ability that exists here. It is clear that as long as the means of entry are right, there is potential to take businesses beyond the micro-enterprise sector. That will continue to be important. When I learned that over 90% of the businesses in the European Union are categorised as being in the micro-enterprise sector, I was surprised and I thought it was very high. I was under the impression that most employment is based in large enterprises. It is an interesting statistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> If we are to build a strong indigenous base, we have to harness the creativity that exists. This is an element of what is definitely needed. One gets a better return into one's economy on the purchase of raw materials from the indigenous sector than one does from foreign companies, welcome as they are. Seed capital of €25 million will continue to be supplied to the banks, which will comprise the primary supplier of finance to the micro-enterprise sector. The availability of another fund cannot be an excuse for the banks to reject applications or fail to take risks. I am worried that is what will happen. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about the sanctions that will be open to him if the banks behave in such a manner when the fund that is being set up is available. The banks, particularly those into which we have pumped enormous sums of money, cannot be allowed to evade their responsibility to this sector. No one is saying there should be irresponsible lending, or there should not be a return on lending. However, it should not be so cautious that the development of an entire sector is impeded. Similarly, established companies that would be viable if they had the funding to keep going should not be hindered. I wonder if the banks know how to lend to business. The conventional criteria for lending that they have used have involved things like a return on bricks and mortar. I do not think they have got their heads around the need for a change in their culture that involves looking at how returns can be made from investment in businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> I would like to speak about the county enterprise boards, which are still in place but are about to come under the umbrella of the local authority sector. I understand the local authorities will receive applications in the first instance. They will process them and make recommendations on them to the Social Finance Foundation, which is a non-profit company. The foundation has had some success in awarding or approving loans. There has been a reasonable level of take-up. One would not expect everything that is awarded to be taken up. The foundation has demonstrated that it can achieve a reasonable level of success. Considerable funds continue to be available to it. While is obvious that some risk is associated with the establishment of this fund, I suggest there is a real possibility of a return from it. This has to be viewed in the context of the totality of the experience of the person who will come in to start an enterprise. Much of it will depend on whether good-quality training is provided to ensure proper business plans and feasibility studies are conducted. Some of the businesses which have been through this approach have availed of the mentoring that is available, for example. Many people say that although they got nothing other than mentoring from the county enterprise boards, it was more valuable than funding. It is important that we do not lose much of the valuable work that has been done by the boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> I am concerned that the county enterprise boards will become a little more anonymous when they are no longer out there on their own. When they are subsumed into the local government system, I do not think they will have the kind of visibility they had before now. It is obvious that a cost will be associated with making sure the transition is smooth. We will have to ensure the boards' valuable visibility, which took time to develop, is not lost. That reputation was built through the power of word of mouth among people who had successful experiences with county enterprise boards. If the boards were funded in a slightly different way, it would complement the work they do. At present, they are funded on an annual basis. I suggest there is an absolute need to consider the possibility of providing roll-over funding, perhaps over three years. I appreciate that moneys can be redistributed. I have some experience of the board in Kildare, which ran out of money in February of last year only for some money to be returned later in the year. Viable proposals that were made during the valuable months after February could not be progressed because the board did not have sufficient funding until the moneys in question were recycled to it in October of last year. When a board receives money late in the year, as happened in Kildare in October 2011, it has to return it if it does not spend it by December and look for it to be drawn down again. A different way of doing things needs to be found to give some certainty to this sector. Given that people will be dealing with this organisation in the first instance, it is important for us to get this right. Having said that, I do not think we should be afraid of institutional change. We should wait to see how this works.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> Some things could have been done to save money. Each of the 35 county and city enterprise boards had to pay audit fees of between €7,000 and €8,000. That comes to approximately €250,000, which is a waste of funds. If a single organisation had been involved, it could have been done in a much more cost-efficient way. A decision has been made on how to save money in that respect. The main thing is that we ensure the new system functions as optimally as possible. Not only will legal arrangements need to be put it in place, but there will also have to be a publicity campaign to heighten awareness of it. We have to let people know how this process will work. Although risk is always associated with a loan fund, there is also the potential for huge reward. This is the least expensive level at which to create jobs. It is clear that if people are taken off social welfare, the demand on the Department of Social Protection is reduced. If people are successful in finding work, there is a return in the form of taxation. It is a no-brainer. We will not know what the take-up of the fund will be until it is rolled out. That is why it is important for the fund to be visible out there. There should be flexibility with regard to how people can access the fund. I know they have to go through the banks in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> I have made the point that I am concerned that the banks might be too ready to refuse other funding in favour of this funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">It should be there as a secondary source. It is intended that this fund should go live by September. Does the Minister believe that target will be met? At what stage would he see funding for this year coming through? The banks must consider this. Will it be available for people immediately so that if, for example, there was a refusal in August a person could apply in September? Will the Social Finance Foundation have any criteria other than the viability of the enterprise it is considering, for example, the geography involved? </p>

          <p eId="para_870">Eight minutes will be fine for me. I am happy to have time to speak on this Bill which, as other speakers remarked, is long awaited. The proposal was announced on a number of occasions. It is welcome although it is a very modest proposal. The overall aim, over a ten year period, appears to be that some €90 million will be lent to approximately 5,500 enterprises and during that period a possible 7,700 jobs will be created, for an average loan of about €16,000. This is worthwhile and welcome but is very modest. It really only scratches the surface in regard to job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> This is a particularly important area for job creation as small enterprises are the very backbone of the Irish economy. If one walks the main streets of any of our towns, villages or cities at present one sees the effects of the devastation that has been visited on small enterprises, with shops, offices and small businesses closed. Very many have been in existence as family enterprises for a long number of years but due to the current recession and the lack of credit they have had to close their doors in recent years, only doing so as the very last resort. In very many cases, and for some time, the owners have taken little or no wages from their enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> The availability of this credit is welcome. Micro enterprises need credit to keep their businesses afloat and to increase in size and this, in turn, is a necessary precondition for economic recovery and growth. Research by the Central Bank has identified that Ireland is the most difficult country in the eurozone for small businesses to access credit. That has been mentioned by the Small Firms Association and other organisations representing small business. It is not before time, therefore, that this initiative has taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> The background to this is a very much bigger area. Although every job created or retained through this proposal is obviously welcome and worthwhile there is a much bigger picture. To reiterate, this measure simply scratches the surface in that regard. The recent CSO figures published two weeks ago reported on the state of health of the Government's job creation measures since it came to office, offering a type of report card on the Government's work in this area in the past 12 months. It was a very poor report card. It showed that job creation was in reverse in that period, that this is a job-destructive rather than a job-creation Government. There were 18,100 fewer jobs in this economy at the end of the first quarter of this year, taking the 12 month period until that date, a period within which this Government was in power. There is 30% youth unemployment and well over 14% general unemployment. Half of those unemployed have been so for more than 12 months and a third have been unemployed for longer than two years. Horrendous as they are, those figures are set against a background of significant emigration, especially of skilled, trained and educated young people who are now supporting economies throughout the world, from Australia to Canada.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> This Bill is well and good but although it is welcome a much bigger job of work has to be done, one that needs considerable job creation measures. The promises made during the last general election and in the programme for Government must be implemented. We need a significant public works programme in order to put people back to work. As I stated, it is simply not good enough to say that what the Government and the State need to do is to create the right environment. It has gone well beyond that now and the State itself must create jobs. We are in a situation where the number of people unemployed and the number of jobs that need to be created can only be dealt with by the State, and only in a situation where there is a great investment strike by very wealthy people, not only in this country but in Britain and throughout the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> It is no longer good enough to talk about creating the environment or creating small numbers of jobs with measures such as this. In order to put people back to work in significant numbers we need significant public works programmes, for example, the school building programme as well as a hospital building programme and a roadworks programme. Doing that will stimulate the economy and ensure that people will have money in their pockets to open up those shops, offices and small businesses that are closed in all our towns, villages and cities throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> Austerity has taken vast amounts of money out of the economy and has created a recession which, if it continues, will create a depression. There is no alternative other than the State getting involved in job creation. That would be good for the economy and the State, for families and the community in general.</p>

          <p eId="para_878">I will conclude. For small businesses as a whole this Bill is welcome and every job that can be created or retained is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">I wish to refer to the position of individuals, particularly in regard to their social welfare contributions, who might want to take up initiatives under the provisions of this Bill. We are all aware of the extremely difficult position in which self-employed have found themselves on applying for social welfare entitlements when their businesses have gone bust. In many cases they find they are not entitled to any payments possibly because other family members are working. The self-employed individuals are not entitled to any payments and their means are assessed on the basis of the income of other family members. That must be a change in that respect. The type of social welfare contribution must be changed to ensure self-employed individuals are encouraged to take up initiatives such as this one in the knowledge that if they do not work out that at least they have the safety net of social welfare benefits.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_880">I welcome the Minister to the House. I thank the Leas-Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> I welcome this debate as at last we can deal with the economic world of small businesses and jobs for our people. We hear a lot of talk about growth and jobs and now is the time for action. Now is the time for creative ideas and I am glad some of my colleagues have put forward some constructive proposals in this debate. It is also a time to examine new ideas in regard to jobs and investments. I welcome any new idea that will create jobs. </p>
          <p eId="para_882"> We should first consider the facts in our small business economy. I have many family friends and constituents in this sector and they often feel they are forgotten with all the talk about the big companies, the multinationals and the debate on the corporation tax. They often feel excluded and that is a matter we should address. Some 177,547 small businesses employ under ten people, 9,769 employ ten to 19 people, 5,215 employ 20 to 49 people, 2,441 employ 50 to 249, and 459 employ 250 and more. Those are the figures. Small businesses that employ between three and 12 people number 37,488. Many people employed in small businesses. This business economy covers industry, construction and services. It does not include enterprises in the public sector, health, education or agriculture sectors. There is huge potential in the small business sector and we need to help those people on the ground. That is the reality. I will deal with a number of constructive proposals later.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> As we are talking about jobs, I had to laugh in recent weeks when a number of Deputies in this Dáil were criticised by certain people about using their expenses to employ people. What is wrong with that? It is a good idea. If a Deputy uses his or her expenses to take on a part-time worker or to take somebody off the dole, that is a good idea. To me, that is not an abuse of public money. That is a matter that should be carefully examined. I want to commend those people directly involved in it. </p>
          <p eId="para_884"> As the Minister and I now represent the new Dublin Bay North constituency north of the River Liffey, located mainly around Dublin Bay, I draw to his attention that 2014 presents great potential in regard to the celebration of the Battle of Clontarf. People are already knocking down my door, and I hope the Minister's door, to talk about developing ideas in tourism, the arts, etc., in the Clontarf-Dublin Bay area to bring in tourists from Norway, Sweden and Denmark with the idea of "Bring the Vikings, Bring them Back Home". I believe Deputy Catherine Murphy already has experiences in this respect of visiting Leixlip in Kildare. We need to be radical and creative to bring in tourists and to bring in money. The Minister should up his game on this issue. He should push that issue with the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, in regard to the celebration of the 1,000 year anniversary of the Battle of Clontarf in 2014. </p>
          <p eId="para_885"> Another idea I thought of during the week relates to the Garden of Remembrance and the build up to the commemoration of the Rising in 2016. Why could we not have a guard of honour at the Garden of Remembrance similar to the guard of honour in England and America? Tourists would come from all over to see the guard of honour and the change of the guard at the Garden of Remembrance. Americans, French and all nationalities would get their photographs taken in the Garden of Remembrance and we could have beautiful system of changing the guard. It could be an international historic item. Those are two sensible ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> The Bill provides for the establishment of a micro-enterprise loan fund and the formation of a private company to lend to micro-enterprises and to mange the fund. The fund is designed to stimulate lending to sustainable micro-enterprises and it is targeted at start-up, newly established or growing micro-enterprises across all industry sectors, employing not more than ten people. The company will be empowered to provide loans of up to €25,000 for commercially viable proposals that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by commercial banks. We are talking about enterprises employing up to ten people. We should zoom into those and I welcome that aspect of the legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_887"> I want to commend the Minister on another aspect. The Bill will also empower the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to give €10 million of Exchequer money to the company for the purpose of lending to microenterprises to set up a scheme which will provide for various terms and conditions such as the purpose for which the loan may be given, the terms of the loan agreement, reports and information by the subsidiary to the Minister, audit and examination of accounts of the subsidiary and other matters. That is what this debate is about. It is about giving a leg up to these people. I commend that part of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> Section 3 provides that the costs associated with administering the Act will be subject to sanction from the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and will be met from moneys provided by the Oireachtas. I have a concern about that section. We have to keep an eye on the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister, Deputy Noonan. These two individuals seem to have caught the austerity bug. If we are to get out of this economic crisis, we will have to have a growth strategy as well. I urge the Minister to stand up to those two Ministers, make his mark in terms of creating jobs because that is the number one item. There are three issues of importance in this State - jobs, jobs and jobs, and that is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> My colleague, Deputy Healy, mentioned the role of the semi-State sector. We should not run away from that. We should not have ideological hang-ups. If some semi-State companies are making money and they have ideas to make it, we should let them at it, roll them out and support them. We should not be against them because they are part of the semi-State sector. If they have a contribution to make, we should act on that, particularly in the context of new ideas in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> We have more than 455,000 people unemployed and we need to get our act together and come up with ideas. We need a proper growth and jobs plan and a strategy to ensure it is implemented. Also, people have a contribution to make themselves. It is not up to the politicians or the Government, it is also up to people. We had a good campaign a few years ago in the old Dublin North Central constitutency, which is now Dublin Bay North in regard to creating jobs. We encouraged people in our constituency to spend an €20 a week in small businesses in the locality. We targeted the campaign at people over the age of 55 who happened to have a few bob. Many young couples do not have the money because they are under stress in terms of their mortgage, employment and cuts in wages. There is a sector of the population that has money. There is money in the economy and it should not be denied that there is not. There is approximately €75 billion in savings accounts in this country. I say to the people who have money that they should spend an extra €20 a week in their local businesses and try to do something as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> I ask the Minister to examine the VAT issue, the rates issue and the insurance issue for small business. We need to give small businesses a chance because they are the future of this country and they will help us get out of this crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_893">This Bill deals with the second commitment in the programme for Government regarding credit for businesses. The question I have relates to section 10. It sets out the maximum amount that can be lent to microenterprises. It deals with the length of the loan, the potential uses of the loan but the part that I am interested in is the part that refers the class or classes of microenterprise that can apply. The explanatory memorandum it states that these loans will be for "commercially viable proposals that do not meet the convention risk criteria applied by commercial banks". There is no wording in the Bill that explains this further. Therefore, any potential restrictive provisions must be written into the scheme to be drawn up under section 10. It is not clear which businesses this would affect.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> I wonder who will be targeted by this Bill. The departmental explanation is that the county and city enterprise boards and the new local enterprise offices will actively engage with applicants in the development of business propositions under this scheme. One might then assume that the category of businesses or potential businesses affected might be quite small unless the scheme under section 10 is broader than the normal or existing remit of the county and city enterprise boards and their national agreements. There needs to be clarification as to who will be affected. The question then arises as to the effect on businesses such as local hardware stores, pubs, restaurants, flower shops, the retailers and whether they will be able to avail of the relief afforded by this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> I have a concern. The IDA and Enterprise Ireland deal with the multinationals and the large exporters and the enterprise boards and Leader organisations deal with innovation, new business ideas and this is how it should be. However, there is a category of businesses which are not benefiting from some of the schemes which we devise and design. These businesses are the small and medium enterprises which have been in business for ten to perhaps 40 years. This category accounts for about 230,000 businesses. They provide €10 billion per year to the Exchequer and they employ 900,000 people. I refer to schemes such as the seed capital scheme and the three-year corporation tax exemption for new start-up companies, competitive start funds for innovative companies doing business in global markets, innovation vouchers, employment and investment incentives. This is all good and productive and I am regularly contacted about these schemes. However, I am also contacted in Waterford more often by long-established businesses who are looking at disaster in the face. </p>
          <p eId="para_896"> The Minister has been very innovative with regard to these schemes. My concern is that this House and the Departments should spend more time assisting the existing small and medium enterprises or as much time as is spent on the potential small and medium enterprises. A large number of jobs have been lost and we need to give more thought to preserving the 900,000 jobs in the small and medium enterprise sector. The emphasis needs to shift slightly back to keeping some of these businesses afloat. We all know that many of them are hurting. I ask for clarification whether this Bill will be engineered to help them.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> It is one thing having a business idea and being unable to access financial assistance but I am aware of people who have businesses and ideas yet the problem is they have seven or eight employees as it is and they are €2 million in debt. This is the situation I come across again and again in Waterford. To put it simply, the existing back bone of small businesses is collapsing in some cases, in particular, in the retail sector. They are not exporters nor are they carrying out research and development; they are traditional retailers such as the dry cleaners, the people who sell motor cars and their issues are commercial rents and rates, energy costs, indirect taxation, legislation and regulation which costs them money. We need to know which businesses the scheme described in section 10 will affect. We need to spend a little more time thinking about the indigenous small and medium enterprise sector and its survival and as much time as is spent on innovation and start-up companies. We have to keep those 900,000 jobs because jobs are haemorrhaging from that sector.</p>

          <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_898">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and I commend the Minister and officials in the Department for their work in bringing it before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> Cash flow is the life blood of business. In the best of businesses, credit or loans are inevitably needed. It is clear that small and medium enterprises are in significant difficulty in obtaining credit or loans in recent times. Public representatives know this from anecdotal information. Businesses in Offaly and Laois have highlighted the difficulty and it is official as a result of research conducted by the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> For example, a local business man with a well-established company recently secured extra business. He had a good credit rating and substantial collateral. However, this was not enough for a bank who refused him a loan when he wished to expand the business. Thanks to this Bill, this will no longer be the case and the entrepreneurs on whom we so clearly depend will be in a better position to continue to do what they do best, to create jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_901"> Surprisingly, we are the most difficult country in the eurozone for small businesses to access credit. Clearly, this situation cannot be allowed to continue. Small businesses are a key component in the functioning and growth of the economy and so this is serious matter which must be addressed. I will take the liberty of quoting Patricia Callan of the SFA who said, "At a time when jobs are in short supply every citizen should be actively encouraged to create a job for themselves".</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> While we are all delighted to welcome good news stories of job announcements as a result of foreign direct investment, it is vital that we provide for the 90% of small businesses which are microenterprises. It has been calculated that on average, funds will be available to the tune of €16,000 and if a business has already been refused credit from banks or other financial institutions, despite being a viable business such as my friend, they will be in a position to apply to Microfinance Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> Many of our people have ideas, skills and determination and it is the responsibility of Government to foster entrepreneurial spirit. Microfinance Ireland will be a welcome addition to the existing supports and grants already available through the city and county enterprise boards which will soon be under the auspices of Enterprise Ireland within the local authorities. I welcome the fact that this finance will be available within the coming weeks. The State will grant €10 million to lend to microenterprises. This sum will also allow Microfinance Ireland to lever further funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> An important component of this Bill is that the focus will be on lending to the microenterprises only as loans to the larger enterprises are already guaranteed under the new credit guarantee scheme. The Government is playing its part in delivering on its commitments in the programme for Government but each of us as consumers must ensure that when we spend, we spend locally and buy Irish as far as possible so that our small businesses such as local butchers and hairdressers, restaurateurs, small food producers, garden centres, can thrive and grow and provide us with the products and services we need. We must play our part in ensuring that as consumers we help to sustain them in their microenterprise and entrepreneurship.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_905">Whatever one's socioeconomic viewpoint there can be no denying that access to finance and credit is critical to the success and sustainability of small businesses which are, in turn, crucial in providing jobs in every community across the country. Almost 200,000 small firms provide employment for over 650,000 citizens a level of employment higher than either the multinational or public sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> The Government, being acutely aware of this, has demonstrated its commitment with a range of measures to support and help small businesses. The advisory group for small business, chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for small business, Deputy John Perry, had extensive consultation with a range of stakeholders to examine what is required in order to remove barriers and to help our small businesses compete. It is an important plan of action which clearly sets out what we need to do and even more important, it identifies those responsible for achieving the stated goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> The Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill is the latest measure introduced by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton and his Department and its genesis can be found in the report on the advisory group for small business. The support the State has afforded the banking sector has been well documented. Some banks were saved on account of their strategic importance to the entire economy while others were saved with more questionable justification. However, once decisions of that magnitude are taken, it can be almost impossible to deviate from the course of action without substantial further cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> By rights, this Bill should not be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">It is entirely plausible and appropriate for citizens to expect the banks to ensure an adequate and steady access route to credit. However, Central Bank research proves, to the shame of the banking sector, that our country is the most difficult country in the eurozone in which to access credit. I recently received representations from a local company in Galway, of many years standing and success, whose efforts to expand by tendering for contracts from abroad were being hampered by the unwillingness of two banks to provide guarantees or letters of credit. The attitudes of the banks have endangered not only the employment of this company's workforce but also that of many other local companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> The advances in technology have transformed the marketplace so that while the focus of the mircofinance fund will justifiably be at the community level, the potential for it to assist our indigenous companies to compete on the global scale are immense. As a small, open economy with a straightforward, investment-friendly framework, enabling local businesses to compete on a European and global level is a logical step and an opportunity which must be encouraged and taken. Just as our wonderfully talented artistic and cultural organisations are internationally renowned, so too can our indigenous businesses be ambassadors for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> The presence of some of the world's largest organisations in Ireland, some of which have established their Europe, Middle East and Africa area headquarters here, is another reason for the importance of promoting and facilitating access to credit for small businesses. The clustering effect which has emerged for several industries, including information and communication technologies, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, has encouraged and stimulated local entrepreneurs to identify and grasp opportunities overlooked by the bigger multinationals. In some cases these smaller Irish start-ups have grown to become leaders in their respective industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> In the past the Irish banks have been the mainstay for providing the financial support and investment required by such companies. However, following the financial and economic turbulence of recent years, a reluctance to take chances has emerged. Undoubtedly, caution and oversight are required for the process of supplying credit and investment but we have reached a stage where previously successful businesses or new businesses with sound entrepreneurial plans are being denied the funds necessary for growth and expansion. In such an eventuality the State must intervene and demonstrate its faith in our entrepreneurs. Although some financial institutions are co-owned by the State, it is not possible for a number of reasons, not least proper governance, for the State or the Department of Finance to become involved with individual cases or the day-to-day running of these institutions. The microfinance loan fund, alongside the Credit Guarantee Bill which was passed by Dáil Éireann last week, will provide a new avenue for the many constituents who have contacted their local Deputies to express their frustration with accessing credit from banks and who have asked Deputies to set up meetings with the Department of Finance so it can peruse their requests or intervene in some manner to provide access to credit which thus far has been refused. There are many examples of that across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> For an initial outlay of €10 million, to be supplemented by borrowings totalling over €15 million, over 5,500 microenterprises will be able to expand or start up, which will result in an estimated 7,700 jobs. I look forward to the implementation of the other recommendations from the Department on small business. If we could help each small firm employ one extra person, our unemployment rate would be cut substantially and, more importantly, hundreds of thousands of citizens would benefit from the independence, fulfilment and personal development that having a job provides.</p>

          <from>Deputy Derek Nolan<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_914">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I praise the Minister for being present for this Second Stage debate. There is no doubt that many businesses are struggling hard due to the lack of credit. I see it in my constituency every week. People who have shops in Galway city, Oranmore and the surrounding areas come to talk to me about the difficulties they are experiencing. Many of them are attributable to the dire economic circumstances of the country and the complete decline in consumer demand, but in many ways they are due to the relationship with their banks. Some of the stories I have heard are very disturbing. One example was a shop that was trading over Christmas. Its overdraft was cancelled on the day before Christmas Eve, when the company was in the middle of its peak trading period. It was a measure calculated by the bank to ensure it could stop the overdraft when the money was there and prevent the overdraft recurring in the new year. In other words, it cut off a vital cash flow and lifeline for that company.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> I also hear from people in Galway about the heavy handed nature with which banks are treating them, especially small businesses. They are almost being bullied. The old relationship or approach banks had, where they would know the business, have a partnership relationship, understand the ins and outs of the business and work with businesses on an individual case by case basis, is being over-ridden by regulations and guidelines from the top applying to every business in the bank. These things are happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> Another matter worth noting, given that we are discussing a Bill that specifically focuses on small businesses, is that many of the businesses the banks look after are very big, and they get priority. It is as if they are too big to fail. The banks cannot allow the big businesses to fail and must keep bankrolling them because if the bank incurs a loss it will be huge. On the other hand they can be much stricter and harsher on small businesses because the exposure level is so much smaller. There are huge concerns among the constituents I represent about how the banking sector works.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> I congratulate the Minister for his work on the Credit Guarantee Bill. I spoke on that Bill, and it is very good legislation. I believe this Bill has great potential to re-orientate the economy. I view it as putting in place a scheme to help start-ups. There was a lack in this country during the boom time. We were very reliant on the sectors that worked, for example, foreign direct investment was working so we banked on it and construction was creating jobs so we banked on it. We neglected the very foundation that any country should have, an indigenous enterprise base. All companies must start somewhere, with some level of funding. It is usually a case of one person or two people having an idea and the drive and energy to pursue it, and this Bill and the fund it establishes will be a key measure in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> On looking through the Bill I tried to find some lending guidelines, to indicate the type of companies that are being targeted. I thought section 10 might contain them but it does not. I understand the Minister will publish them separately. They will certainly be worthy of consideration and debate on Committee Stage because we must ensure that this fund is defined and that people know exactly what it is for, so it is not seen as a be-all and end-all for people with an overdraft problem, loan problem or credit problem. We must know exactly what it is there for so we can market it as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> The scheme is to be integrated with the county and city enterprise boards, which are to be integrated with the local authorities. I hope all of that will be done in a single move. It should not be a type of one-stop-shop one calls to which then refers one to another office. We must ensure there is a link and relationship with those people, so the people who work in the renamed enterprise boards know the intricate workings of the scheme, have a good relationship with the managers and so forth. That will lead to a real flow of information to the people who require it.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> It was mentioned in some of the documentation that the Credit Review Office can duplicate some of the functions. I realise the Credit Review Office's work only applies to two banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, but it would be great if that office could declare, having reviewed the file, that there is a credit case for the enterprise, even though the bank was right to refuse it. To save the work being done again that file could be sent straight to the microfinance fund as a credible alternative source of funding. It it is deemed worthy of the criteria, we would again be saving the enterprise that extra hurdle and extra bureaucratic layer in seeking funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> Again, I welcome the Bill. It is a very positive step. I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the work they are doing. The action plan for jobs is an excellent plan and the fact that it is being rolled out properly and on schedule is to be commended. I look forward to seeing exactly what the lending guidelines will be, but I have no doubt that the Bill will be a success. It will be very welcome to the small business sector and will ensure our economy generates indigenous enterprises to help us get out of the current mire.</p>

          <p eId="para_928">Section 10 states that the Minister will set out the maximum amount that can be lent to microenterprises. I was involved in setting up a number of enterprises, and getting the first loan was not the biggest difficulty. It was when we tried to get beyond our little industry to make it a proper industry that we hit the wall.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> If we are talking about average loans of €16,000 and €90 million over ten years, which is €9 million a year, the reality is that someone who sets up a business will find very quickly that this kind of money will be petty change in their pocket. That is the hard reality for most businesses that will have any kind of significant employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> I was a great advocate for just starting the business and figuring it out later. It is just as well we did it that way because if we had not we would never have set up a new business. I have no doubt that if everything we had planned to do was analysed carefully at the beginning, the flaws in what we intended to do would have been seen. When we set up the timber mill we had no three phase electricity and therefore we got a tractor and put the machine for debarking the timber on the back of it. We needed a treatment plant. We bought that and put it on the single phase electricity. We then realised there were problems getting trucks to bring the timber in and out of the forest and, lucky for us, we managed to get some assistance to get that sorted out. We found it was not as simple as we had figured out because timber was coming in that was not suitable for our equipment and we had to keep growing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> The problem with this is that in terms of going from finance provider to finance provider, when a company gets to a certain stage of a problem as well as to a certain stage of growth - at €16,000 it will not be a very big company - many of them will get into trouble. In terms of my experience, we were lucky. The one wise decision we made was to bring in North Connacht Farmers, now Connacht Gold, as a partner. It had resources and it also had a market for us and, therefore, I did not have to worry about the market in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> I am not saying this to be negative. I am saying it because I often find that a business always works out at the initial stage when the idea is written on a bit of paper. One will do the figures to make it work out because if one did not do that one would not even start the business. However, when one actually starts, and it is similar to somebody saying they are going to build a house for a fixed amount of money, one suddenly realises that there are things one had not thought of or provided for that needed to be done and issues that needed to be solved. In terms of the actuality of people's lives, everybody who started a business will say that they underestimated the difficulty of setting up a business, particularly anything in manufacturing.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> Where one really hits the wall is on the phase 2 operation, in other words, when one is under real pressure. It is costing more than one thought and one goes back to the bank and says that at this level it will not work. My worry is for someone in the microfinance process. The company has set them up. It has given them a loan of, say, €15,000 or €16,000 to get them started but when they realise that amount will not get them business and that they are not making the profits they had predicted, that is when they really need the faith and the help.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> For that reason, the limit the Minister will impose under section 10 will be vital. The question of whether the microfinance lender can remain with that person and give them more money will be vital because most people who start in business run through the dark hours of it going wrong. Some of the most successful businesses needed that great leap of faith, the second loan, the loan that provided when everything was not going according to plan. It is very important that we examine how that will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> I hope that we will get acorns out of this measure that will grow into oak trees. I agree that microenterprises are important but we must be clear that if we are talking about a microenterprise employing only one or two people, we will be a long time solving the unemployment problems of the country if we have to do it that way. I presume what the Minister would hope for in reality is that these enterprises would grow and employ ten to 20 people, or even more than that. We were luckier. The business we started on the back of a hill is employing multiples of that number.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> This is important but I have had this argument about Leader funds over the years and with the <i>de minimis</i> rule in Europe set at €200,000. I have argued time and again that I do not believe a substantial industry employing ten or 20 people can be set up with that kind of grant aid. It is not sufficient because the cost burdens in setting up a business are very significant, particularly if it is a business in the manufacturing sector. I welcome this measure. Nobody could go against it, but it is very finite. Any idea that this is a major panacea, at €10 million a year, in terms of dealing with the major problems of unemployment is wide of the mark.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> The second issue that we must examine is the length of time given for repayment. There is a presumption that a business gets into profit quickly but many companies find that when they start in the real world, so to speak, they do not get into profit fast. What they want are more borrowings without any repayments, and the big advantage of a grant over a loan is that they do not have to repay the money. The time given for repayment is vital. Based on all my experience of dealing with other people who were involved in setting up businesses, and having been involved myself, I believe we must give reasonably long timescales for people to pay back loans. In the first year it would be very difficult even to service the interest on a loan, never mind the capital on a loan. </p>
          <p eId="para_938"> There is much work to be done on the enterprise sector. I never agreed with the European Union attitude towards state aids where, for example, under the Leader programmes it has the <i>de minimis</i> rule of €200,000. I can never understand the logic that giving a grant of €300,000 or €400,000 to a small industry in the far west of Ireland will in some way upset the free trade of Europe or in some way be unfair competition, regardless of where one is on this island, with an industry located on the main territory of Europe which does not have to travel across two seas to get its goods onto the large European market. Europe could look to America and learn some lessons there. I recall as Minister travelling to Europe and arguing with Commissioners that their <i>de minimis</i> rule and their attitude towards state aid was very negative and over-restrictive.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> I remember visiting Wisconsin and being told that an American state can give any grants it wants.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">The starting point in this discussion must be that the arts are not a luxury which can be easily dispensed with in times of economic crisis. Rather, they represent a crucial part of our cultural identity and a key lever in terms of exploring and developing the creative talent and potential of all of our citizens. It could be legitimately argued that supporting the arts is even more important in times of austerity, in order to give people an outlet to develop their potential. We see the benefits and value of that in programmes run for young people, for elderly citizens and for troubled teenagers etc. There are unquantifiable results to these which bring a huge saving in terms of the health budget, mental health budget and the general well-being of society. In that context, we cannot see this discussion solely from the point of view of financial cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> It is part of the problem with the McCarthy report that discussion on these issues takes place against the backdrop of threatened serious changes to arts policy. In that sense, I support the purpose behind the motion, namely, to ring-fence some of the fundamental principles regarding arts policy in general and funding. I wish to put on record the importance of the "arm's length" principle remaining and the necessity for cultural institutions and the Arts Council to get on with their work without political interference. We need only pick up a newspaper to see the importance of impartiality, particularly when we see what private ownership of the media has done in terms of distorting public opinion. In the matter of the arts, the independence and integrity of our cultural identity is critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> On funding, Arts Council funding needs to be secure. However, there is a case for looking at how it is disbursed and for examining the role of local authorities and local authority arts officers and directing funding to them. These people are at the coal face and know what is going on, but they have not been receiving funding, rather the opposite. In fact, arts programmes have been diminished. If we are serious about developing the arts, this is where it must start. We have seen good projects, like the Over the Edge workshops that take place in Galway which are part funded by the Arts Council and Galway City Council, developing poetry workshops, publishing new poets and bringing development in that regard. While there is a basis for some streamlining, this should only be on the basis of the funding being ring-fenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> The Arts Council has a role to play in continuing to support independent publishers. These play a vital role in terms of developing and publishing new writers, but they do more than that. They have brought and promoted Ireland's arts agenda abroad. Culture Ireland has played a successful role in that regard, in conjunction with publishers like Salmon Publishing and others, which have brought creative writing out of this country to workshops and facilities in America and Australia, which have generated revenue when these people have returned and have developed the arts abroad. For all sorts of reasons it makes sense to ring-fence this in order to secure independence and funding.</p>

Arts and culture are not optional extras and should not be measured by financial or economic metrics. It is not too grandiose to say that arts, culture and heritage are what make us human and define us as creative beings. They are what separate us from every other species on the planet. Treating arts and cultural institutions like just another quango or as just an opportunity to cut costs, threatens the essence of what we are as human beings and is misguided. This is even more true at a time of recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> It may be of interest to the Minister to know that the first theatres in ancient Greece began in healing centres and it was from this that we got the term "catharsis". Theatre was about therapeutic healing and it was from that theatre developed. Never has that role been more important and necessary than now when we are faced with a huge economic recession. This recession resulted from straying away from human priorities and focusing purely on economic and financial interests. This has led us to the current impasse. Faced with this situation, there has been a significant return to the arts. More people are visiting galleries and museums and more people are getting involved in poetry and visiting the theatre. Therefore, the last thing we should be doing is making cuts in the culture area or to cultural institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_947"> This error is repeated in the Government's motion, in that all the language is the language of corporate and commercial speak, such as "customer service", "service delivery channels", "reducing our costs", "better value for money" and "implementation and delivery". That is not the language we should use to talk about the arts, culture and heritage. They are not about those things, nor should they be. It is a tragedy that we ever have to charge for access to the arts, culture or heritage. With regard to the institutions the Minister proposes to merge for cost-cutting purposes - treating them like quangos - access to them is free. Therefore, the proposal to merge them on the basis of achieving short-term cuts is a grave error. As somebody said in a meeting on this issue yesterday, it is like saying we should merge the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA, because they are all sports that use a ball. Of course, they are distinct sports and should not be treated and lumped in together as if they are the same on the basis of cost-cutting.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"> These proposals are more galling because all of this cost-cutting is being done to bail out bankers. I will finish by citing the poet Bertolt Brecht who said the crime of robbing a bank was nothing compared to the crime of owning one. He was right. It is a tragedy that our society, our arts, culture and heritage should face cuts in order to bail out the bankers and bondholders who brought our country and Europe to the sorry pass it is in now.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_949">We continue the debate we started on priority questions and I thank the Chair for the meeting I had with him. Any organisation or institution worthy of its name will regularly examine and analyse what is going well and the areas in need of reform. Our cultural and artistic institutions do this regularly. Their point is that they do not want change just for the sake of it. In general, the artistic and cultural organisations have been working well. If the car is going well, why tinker with the engine?</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> These proposals were first made in an interdepartmental report in 1974. The proposed amalgamations were rejected then on the grounds that there were distinct differences in the disciplines involved, there were serious problems with space for amalgamated entities, there was no indication of money savings and because the National Archives had statutory standing. Those reasons are still valid. All are agreed that a sound and thorough cost-benefit analysis is vital. Also vital is real and meaningful consultation with the bodies involved. The Minister said he has an open door for anyone who wants to come and speak to him on this issue. It is vital that all the boards are independent in order to ensure proper governance. They must also be expertise-led, and board members must have real experience in the arts and of maintaining budget discipline. The current boards have been doing well in this regard. I have an issue with regard to the payment of expenses for board members, but I am aware that many of the members of these boards have waived expenses. All the institutions agree with the shared services notion, but they want the principle of "arm's length" kept intact. They have already been coping with cuts. Putting culture under one rule is dangerous, just as putting the media under one hand is dangerous. </p>
          <p eId="para_951"> Mention has been made of Canada. It is the only country where national archives and libraries have been amalgamated, but considerable funding was invested in that.</p>

          <p eId="para_952">I am not being political when I highlight that the concerns expressed in the motion correspond to measures promised in the budget of 2009 by the party then in government. I raise this because at the time I was wary of the proposals and I would still be wary were they to be introduced as fashioned at that time, that is, without any real public consultation, any cost benefit analysis or any functional rationale for the changes. The debate is timely and I am glad that a public consultation process is ongoing. I urge the Minister to ensure it will be a real public consultation process and that there will be an opportunity for the artistic community to respond to any proposals before they are set in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> I welcome the Minister's statement that the Government has committed to programming and curatorial independence, whatever reforms are brought forward. The absence of this is a real fear of the artistic community, a fear I share. It is the fear that the freedom and independence traditionally held by these institutions would be taken from them upon being absorbed into the Department, a move seen as the kiss of death to creativity. Changes to boards and changes to terms of reference and administration can have the same effect and I urge the Minister to be cautious in how he proceeds in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> One thing this country has got right is support for the arts. A small but significant investment has leveraged considerable creative activity and audience participation, which is equally important. There is a considerable payback for the taxpayer's investment. I acknowledge that some of the artistic community take the view that we should not discuss the effect that we have abroad by driving inward investment and artistic tourism. These people maintain that there should be art for art's sake in Ireland but I disagree because an internationally successful and cultural and artistic image is good for our economy. Through music, literature, dance and film Ireland, as a small and remote island in the world, can communicate its sense of identity to the rest of the world. Projecting a positive identity is important not only for our economy but for our sense of self worth. We need only recall the desolation we felt as a nation only some years ago when the international media referred to us as the economic basket-case of Europe. At that time the only good news coming from Ireland was from the artistic community and its successes. We all basked in these successes and they reinforced our sense of national self worth.</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> Success is fragile and I put it to the Minster that we tamper at our peril with structures that have allowed the arts to thrive in Ireland. The Minister is correct to state that no organisation or recipient of taxpayer's money is above examination or reform. The institutions involved have brought forward ideas to save money and improve their activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> The artistic community is not inflexible or resistant to change. On the contrary, it is one of the drivers of change in society and the challengers of the <i>status quo</i> and when it expresses reservations about change we should listen to what it has to say. Naturally, we all recognise that there must be savings, changes to back-room services, sharing of services and so on. There should be more outward-looking boards as well and perhaps the organisations should be somewhat more commercial. This much is accepted but I put it to the Minister that it should be sacrosanct that the artistic and cultural instructions maintain their independent and freedom, especially from political interference.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ann Phelan<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_957">I am fortunate to represent the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny and to have held the position of chairperson of the special policy committee on arts, heritage and tourism for several years while a member of Kilkenny County Council. For this reason alone I am a major supporter of the arts. Of all the sectors in society in Ireland today, the arts, culture and heritage sectors are the only sectors that have never let us down.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> I have become aware of the significant position that Kilkenny holds in the national heritage and cultural areas. I am proud of the fact that Kilkenny has earned the accolade of the cultural heart of Ireland and the home of heritage due to its legacy from the former Minister and now President, Michael D. Higgins. He initiated the decentralisation of the Heritage Council to Kilkenny some years ago. I have seen at first hand the good feeling that comes from this sector. The arts and culture sectors are unique not only because of their employment creation potential but because of the sustainability of such employment and what it generates for local communities and economies. Any amount of statistical information shows how the creative industries benefit economies and communities. For us, the arts is like money in that it is not everything but it is everything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_959"> People who work in these areas have proven to be progressive thinkers. This is why I am eager to participate in the Private Members' debate brought forward by Fianna Fáil. I note, however, that we are having this discussion as a result of Fianna Fáil's maladministration while in government, to which the previous speaker referred. It is entertaining that after one year in the Opposition benches, they appear to have all the answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_960"> Having worked in the cultural sector I have watched with interest the development of the national cultural institutions over the years. I advise caution in making any material changes to these institutions because of the considerable investment in skills and funding that the people have contributed. The public reform plan 2011 proposed to merge the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Ireland while retaining their separate identities.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> Several employees working in the visual arts attended a public forum organised by the Irish Museum of Modern Art in 2009. It featured speakers involved in similar amalgamations elsewhere. The general consensus was that merging institutions did not bring about the desired result. Given other circumstances I would agree with such a statement but the fact is that we are now living in difficult times. All Department must introduce reform mechanisms to retrieve savings. The country has been forced into an environment in which competing interests are vying for limited, scarce resources and we are all left between a rock and a hard place. We have been forced into a position today whereby our heritage is competing with the rights of those on social welfare, the demands of those in desperate need of medical care and assistance and the rights and obligations we have towards our children in respect of education, transport, special needs and other resources. This is a difficult position to be in. I have always been a great advocate of the arts and I note the Minster has said that his door is open. Last night the Minister stated that some recent commentary has suggested that he was planning to effectively dismantle these organisations but that he was planning no such thing and nor was the Government. I thank the Minister for that assurance.</p>

          <p eId="para_962">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. The point made by Deputy Ann Phelan was significant. It was news to me to hear that Kilkenny is the cultural heart of the country. Cork was the European capital of culture in 2005 and it was a remarkable year for the city. I echo the point Deputy Phelan made about our cities, that is, culture is of great importance to the regions of our nation. Unquestionably, the capital city has contributed a great deal to the sector as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">When people think about our country, our rich culture and tradition of music and art come to their minds. We are fortunate that the Minister understands the significance of these institutions. The recent donation of one of the country's most significant art collections to the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork was well received and a signal that culture spreads across our island.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> Fianna Fáil's motion tries to erase the 14 years that party spent in Government. We are in difficult economic times and Ministers are forced to investigate reform and cost saving measures not only in the arts but also in our hospitals, the Garda and social welfare system. Nobody likes to speak about cuts or cost savings in the context of the arts and culture but several key cultural organisations have themselves suggested areas which could be streamlined while maintaining services and allowing people to enrich themselves through the cultural experiences our country offers. Some of the most important participants in this process are our local authorities. I encourage them to continue to provide funding for arts officers because cultural funding at local level provides some of the greatest benefits. This is an area which needs to be monitored by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> More work can be done to develop a legacy from our significant investments in arts and culture, such as the capital of culture in 2005. Too often we call a halt after holding an event but there is potential to develop legacies from many of our cultural activities. I understand a major programme is planned for the Presidency of the European Union in 2013. We need to work towards securing a legacy from these events.</p>

          <p eId="para_966">I welcome the opportunity to debate Ireland's cultural infrastructure and the importance of our cultural institutions. As someone who has been immersed in cultural life both professionally and as a citizen, I value the key role that cultural institutions play in helping us to present various manifestations and expressions of our identity and our Irishness. They are often the first reference point for visitors to this country, particularly those who are interested in our history and culture and they also help us to project ourselves to the outside world.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> I remind those who have mobilised around the subject matter of this debate that rationalising the management structures of certain institutions is not the same as interfering with the arm's length relationship that we all cherish. It would be foolhardy of any Government to interfere in the curatorial and decision making independence of our cultural institutions. This is a direction that would not sit easily with me. However, there are ways in which the operation and management of these institutions can be reformed without compromising their autonomy.</p>
          <p eId="para_968"> Certain institutions connected to the arts merit the type of attention our cultural institutions have attracted from the Minister and the cultural sector in the context of this debate. I am sure others in the sector are as concerned as I am at the evisceration of a host of regional theatre companies through the unceremonious withdrawal of their core funding. This is not an abstract or academic point; it affects real people. Working artists and administrators are now facing an uncertain future. The net effect of this type of decision is to centralise professional theatre in selected areas and call into question the commitment to the regions. I trust that the arts sector is as disturbed as I am by this worrying trend and that everybody who campaigns and cares for a viable and professional arts sector will take as strong a stand on those grievous issues as they have done in respect of our cultural institutions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Colm Keaveney<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_969">We saw in a recent debate on "The Frontline" that some people in our society see little value in spending public money on the arts. In the context of current fiscal challenges it is not difficult to see how spending on the arts or overseas aid can be open to suggestions that we should cut funding, particularly when they are placed alongside cuts in education or health. However, the arts and heritage sectors in Ireland play an important role in economic growth, with arts and culture contributing 7% of total GNP and 8% of total employment. From this perspective, the State's contribution to the sector is money well spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_970"> I was reassured by much of what the Minister had to say in his contribution last night and most of my concerns have been put to rest. The Government's reform plan is essential for reversing the damage caused by the previous Government but it should not be seen as an opportunity to sacrifice a critical sector of Irish society for short-term expediency. As the Latin aphorism states, <i>ars longa, vita brevis</i>, which means life is short but art is eternal. We owe it to future generations to pass on our heritage and enrich our history and past. To this end I am glad to see the Minister is confounding his critics by demonstrating his understanding of the importance of the individuality and independence of those who are involved in the arts and heritage sector, while at the same time seeking value for money in the context of shared resources such as human resources, payroll and insurance. This is an approach I have often spoken about in a past life.</p>
          <p eId="para_971"> My concerns about the sector are not addressed by this motion or the proposed amendment. Individuality and independence are essential for the arts because they create the right environment for creativity and vitality. Our arts and heritage sectors are kept alive and connected to the regions through small local arts and drama groups. The recent approach of the Arts Council betrays a worrying lack of accountability and is damaging the industry by creating the impression of a closed circle. I ask the Minister to investigate the issues raised by my colleagues as a matter of urgency. The arts community needs to focus on issues which are perhaps closer to home and therefore more difficult for us to address in the context of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> Our efforts should be on corroboration involving all stakeholders and I am delighted the Minister has announced that his door is open to suggestions for the effective delivery and nurturing of arts, culture and heritage in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_973">Our arts and artists are this country's greatest ambassadors. Literature, poetry, plays, painting, theatre production, film and music making, whether traditional or classical, foster our native creativity, encourage and strengthen our sense of unyielding humanity and draw visitors from all over the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> In my constituency of Galway West the artistic expression of our culture, led by a vibrant and unique community of creative minds, has given Galway an identity and soul of his own. The Cúirt International Festival, the Galway Arts Festival, the Galway Film Fleadh, the Stirling Sessions and the Galway Jazz Festival, among many others, are but the organised expressions of that ethos. Is mór an trua é nach bhfuil níos mó ama agam chun labhairt faoin bpáirt tábhachtach atá ag an nGaeltacht sa chultúr seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> The arts sector contributes millions of euro to the economy and supports thousands of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">The Galway Arts Festival has an economic impact of some €17.5 million, with almost two thirds of those attending shows staying in private accommodation. It has a major impact on the tourism sector and on employment. It is vital that the Government continues funding for the arts that is targeted towards well thought out and practical programmes that deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> I pay tribute to Galway City Council and its arts office. The council contributes a major amount of money to recognise the contribution of the arts. I pay tribute to the late Mr. Mike Diskin, former manager of the Town Hall Theatre, who played a major role in the development of community arts in Galway. I would like to see another useful debate on the value of the arts and where it is going. The economic impact of the arts is plausible and must be recognised but we cannot view the arts purely as a commodity, something on which to put a price. When I was a councillor and my predecessor in the Galway West constituency was a Deputy, I spoke with Michael D. Higgins about the cost overrun of the Town Hall Theatre. He told me it was never intended to break even or make money. It was meant to be a town hall theatre in which people could watch plays. If that requires a subsidy, so be it because arts and culture do not come cheap. Regardless of money, we must say that the arts are important and need public subsidy.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> Our approach to the arts could be broadened. This could be a good debate if we had more time. I refer to the work of Mary McPartlan, who works in NUI Galway developing a programme to introduce arts into other disciplines such as engineering and medicine and more concrete subjects. The value of the arts in terms of creativity and opening people's minds to alternatives and different ways of doing things is a skill and a gift. We must broaden art beyond something that is in an art gallery or theatre. It is something within us all. I ask that the individuality and independence of the cultural institutions is maintained. It is extremely important and is vital to their survival.</p>

          <p eId="para_979">I am glad to speak in support of the Minister. I listened to what he said yesterday and I was more than happy with his contribution. The continuation of funding for the arts is vital. The potential for ways to improve ourselves, to create jobs and to bring the country out of recession is clear in the tourism area. Some weeks ago, we brought the British ambassador to Cashel to see what the area had after the Queen's visit last year. The ambassador and people with him were amazed at the hidden gems in the area and what we could do in a place like Cashel. There is great potential for tourism and investment around this country. It applies to every village around Ireland. There is potential for job creation. In light of the potential for employment, funding needs to continue in the best way the Minister can provide in these circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> Some counties, including South Tipperary, were slow in appointing arts officers. The benefit of such an appointment when the person is committed, supportive and helpful is great value for money for South Tipperary County Council. The council was the last local authority to make such an appointment but it was a great investment. The tourism potential of the arts, the events organised and the ideas of our young people are considerable. We may need a debate on how to put together a package on the job creation potential for the arts but there will be no argument on investing in it. I support this idea because there is positive potential in it. There will be great benefit if we support it and stick together.</p>

          <p eId="para_981">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion although I did not feel comfortable at first. It is not an area to which I am accustomed, unlike my esteemed colleague Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy. I am familiar with her work in County Offaly and her contribution to the arts. I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> I decided to meander out of the House today and familiarise myself with places I do not usually go to. I went to the National Gallery of Ireland and re-familiarised myself with the beautiful Caravaggio painting. I encourage others to do likewise. I also went to Anne's Lane and a wonderful photography exhibition of the work of Willie Doherty from the Bogside in Derry. He is an international photographer with an exhibition of black-and-white photographs taken 30 years ago at the height of the Troubles.</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> There is a role for the arts and I try to say that as discerningly as I can. In the course of debate in this country over the past five years the impression is sometimes created that we almost live inside an economy. Sometimes we get institutionalised by this mindset and in this context the role for the Members of this House is to reach out to the arts. The arts are already reaching out at community grassroots level such as the Earagail Arts Festival in Donegal. The Galway politicians mentioned the formidable Galway Arts Festival. I refer to community arts and photography, through Willie Doherty, who is reaching out as a talented photographer. He is reaching out to communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> In order to bring about the reconciliation we all aspire to in Northern Ireland, we must reach out to the arts. The arts have done tremendous work. If I speak on behalf of an artist, I will completely undersell his work. However, Willie Doherty is trying to reach a true understanding of what happened in Northern Ireland over the past 30 or 40 years. We must get to the bottom of it and appreciate that there will be scars. I encourage people North and South, Members and those outside the House, to view the powerful imagery of a photograph, shot on the Border between Muff and Derry, of a roadway where, two years ago, the body of Ciaran Doherty was dumped by the Real IRA. Photographs shot 30 years ago are as vivid as if we were back in that time. I encourage people to go to the Kerlin Gallery on Anne's Lane. To get to the bottom of the issue, the photographic imagery will do more to promote what happened than any politician can articulate.</p>

          <p eId="para_985">I welcome the opportunity to speak, albeit for only three minutes. I have requested that we have statements on the arts in the near future. I look forward to a more extended opportunity to speak on the arts.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> I thank Deputy McHugh for acknowledging my work in the arts in a voluntary capacity at community level. It has enhanced my life and I hope others have also gained. In this country we take the arts for granted. The report of an bord snip nua galvanised all who are passionate about the arts to highlight the value of the arts in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">We benefit from the arts in many different ways, whether as practitioners or as people who attend artistic performances, exhibitions and so on. It is wonderful that we are finally having a debate on this, two and a half years down the line. I take this opportunity to commend the National Campaign for the Arts on its ongoing work in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> Participants in arts-related activities are sometimes so engrossed in producing their work or participating at in particular activities, at whatever level, that they forget to consider their work in a broader context in terms of the value they are bringing to themselves, their communities and society as a whole. The Indecon report commissioned by the Arts Council put figures on something we all assumed but had no way of proving. The report showed, for example, that the arts sector provides more than 21,000 jobs and contributes more than €300 million in taxes. We learned from the report that the wider creative industry gives €4.7 billion to the economy annually. These data copperfasten the convictions of those of us who are passionate about the arts as to its wide-ranging value to our society. What is more, they will help to convince those who are distracted by issues they consider more important that we must continue to invest in the arts on the basis that such investment will benefit us all. We have not yet acknowledged the value in a range of therapies, whether health therapy, involvement with youth and so on. We must explore all of that more fully.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> As a people, we seem to have lost sight of the reality that our cultural institutions belong to all of us. People are often amazed to be told that entrance to the National Museum and National Gallery, for instance, is free. Unfortunately, the Acting Chairman has indicated that my time is up. I am looking forward to a debate where I will have an opportunity to expand on the points I have made. I am passionate about the arts and am committed to doing everything I possibly can to ensure the artistic community will continue to be supported in its endeavours for the benefit of society in general.</p>

          <p eId="para_990">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment Deputy Robert Troy and thank Senator Fiach Mac Conghail for his presentation yesterday evening. A recurring theme to emerge from this debate is the message that the arts are a necessity not a luxury, an asset not an overhead. I cannot imagine an Ireland in which citizens could not participate in the enjoyment of arts and culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> As other speakers have observed, the arts make a significant contribution to the economy. The 2011 Arts Council report indicated that the sector provides direct and indirect employment, supporting 21,300 jobs and contributing €306 million in taxes. That is not to say, of course, that the arts should be evaluated solely on economic grounds. However, I draw the Minister's attention to the economic study which showed that the value to the local economy of the Galway Arts Festival was €17.5 million in 2011. It is the arts which drive the tourism industry, with most visitors to this country taking time to visit museums and galleries and attend festivals and events. Studies and surveys show that for 70% of visitors to Galway, the arts festival was a factor in their decision to come. We look forward to this year's event which will begin in two weeks time.</p>
          <p eId="para_992"> This is not the first campaign to highlight the importance and value of the arts. Three years ago, at a time of threat to arts funding, an event was held outside the town hall in Galway at which politicians were invited to sing, play a musical instrument, recite a poem or tell a story. I recall Pádraic McCormack, then a Member of this House, performing his juggling party piece. The event succeeded in its objective of securing the maintenance of arts funding, for which great credit was due to the organiser, Lelia Doolan. The latter is currently trying to persuade the Department to release the €2.1 million available for the Galway Picture Palace project.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> The Minister is undoubtedly aware of the work of Music for Galway. Members of that group have been eager to stress the arms-length principle that has underpinned arts policy and structures in the State for more than 60 years. They have warned against undue political interference and emphasised the importance of having an independent board of the Arts Council. These are important messages to take on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> It is vital that a cost-benefit analysis is undertaken before proceeding with any of the proposed mergers of cultural institutions. The Minister should begin by speaking to people in those institutions about the ways in which savings and efficiencies might be achieved. Some mergers might end up being more costly in the long run, as happened in Canada where, as I understand it, the amalgamation of the national library and national archives cost some CAN $15 million. Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett used the analogy of merging sporting bodies to illustrate the absence of a sound rationale for such proposals. The question was raised last night as to whether the GAA, FAI and IRFU should be merged on the basis that they all represent ball sports, with each code merely using a different type of ball. That is clearly absurd.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> To sum up, we must avoid short-term decisions which might endanger the future of the arts sector. Instead, we should encourage participation, foster innovation and continue to enhance Ireland's reputation in the arts on the world stage. It is important to appreciate the economic potential of the arts and the creative industry. I will reject any plan for the merging of cultural institutions which would tend to undermine their independence and prove damaging to our cultural heritage.</p>

          <p eId="para_996">I join colleagues on all sides of the House in commending Deputy Robert Troy, Fianna Fáil Party spokesperson on the arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht, on bringing forward this issue for political attention in the Dáil. The arts are also receiving attention in the Seanad this week. At a time of economic pressures across all Departments, we must ensure that areas of funding which were traditionally seen as "easy targets" do not get squeezed.</p>
          <p eId="para_997"> Investment in the arts has manifold pay-offs. In many ways, the arts are at the heart of what Ireland is about and how it is seen from abroad. We should hold this strong cultural heritage dear. There is an onus on the Oireachtas to take every measure possible to ensure our cultural institutions are protected and enhanced. In this regard, I urge the Minister to take on board what is proposed in this motion and the points made in this debate before proceeding with any plans to merge cultural institutions. Following consultation with many of the bodies concerned, it has become clear that some of the proposed measures will have serious repercussions. Moreover, there is no clear outline as to where the desired cost savings will arise from such an initiative. It makes sense on many levels to reconsider these proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> One of the proposed actions is the introduction of shared services for the National Library and the National Museum. These two bodies perform very valuable but separate functions. Combining responsibility for very important but distinct services to the State such as are provided by these institutions is to blur the lines and engender confusion as to their respective objectives and functions. Members of the arts community have been very generous with their time over the years, above and beyond the requirements of any funding they received. Many people working in the sector or with an appreciation of the sector and our culture give of their time voluntarily in a variety of ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">It is incumbent upon us to ensure that in establishing bodies for distinct purposes they are independent in terms of policy making. If we can do so, people with a strong interest in the enhancement of those bodies will provide their services at board level to protect them and ensure they perform to the optimum. </p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> It is questionable whether the proposal to combine the Museum of Modern Art, the Crawford Art Gallery and the National Gallery, while retaining separate identifies, can be achieved. In addition, many people have expressed reservations about the plan to merge the National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure us that he will not proceed with those proposals and instead leave the institutions as they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> A lot is being asked of the arts sector, which is already under severe pressure. Current funding for the arts is down by 6% this year, from €124 million to €117 million, as a result of the most recent budget. The Arts Council's budget is down by 3%. In addition, arts capital funding has been most severely hit, down 34%, from €32 million to €22 million. Those measures will have repercussions for the future. This week we have seen the first moves by Ministers positioning themselves for the next budget. The Minister, however, should ensure the arts are prioritised as much as possible, while considering the impact that budgetary measures may have. We must continue to value the work of the arts sector. The Minister must ensure that our cultural institutions retain their independence and continue to be supported.</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1002">I join other colleagues in commending Deputy Troy for tabling this motion. I add my voice to the many others that have endorsed the positive contribution of the thriving arts and cultural sector. From 2005 to 2010, €1.1 billion was invested in the sector. The success of that investment can be measured in the fact that it contributes €4.7 billion per annum to our economy. In addition, it supports 79,000 jobs directly and indirectly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> The arts should not necessarily be measured in economic terms, despite the positivity I have mentioned. The sector should be measured against the need to protect and promote our cultural heritage and foster and engender new and diverse cultures in future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> As a county councillor in Offaly I saw at first hand the initial benefits of setting up an arts office, appointing an arts officer and agreeing and approving multi-annual arts programmes. That will culminate with the new county arts centre and theatre in Tullamore in the coming years. In this regard, I want to commend publicly and thank the Minister for the continuance of funding that was promised by the previous Government. He has worked with the local committee to make sure the project becomes a reality following the success of the planning application.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> It only remains for me to reiterate some of the main points of the motion as moved by Deputy Troy yesterday evening. We believe it would be irresponsible not to publish the cost-benefit analysis of the proposed changes before proceeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> The independence and autonomy of this sector is crucial and must be maintained. The 2002 Bill, which we enacted, gave legislative protection to the arm's length principle, which is the very basis for the Arts Council's independence in disbursing funds. However, abolishing boards and bringing them under the Minister's direct control will undermine that principle which has proven to be such a financial and cultural success, as was detailed earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1008">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Troy agus an Seanadóir Mac Conghail as ucht an rún seo a chur os comhair an dá Theach anocht.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">Ten years ago, I travelled at Deputy Deenihan's invitation, to his home town of Listowel to see what a vibrant, community-based arts sector can do for a town's self confidence and identity, not to mention the economic benefits. The current Minister was central to that and has been involved in everything that has happened there since. That spirit is what we need in the Department now, particularly in the way this process is being handled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> Focusing on the amendment, I am concerned that its wording gives an example of where the Department is coming from concerning this process. It starts by noting the many successful initiatives by Ireland's national cultural institutions which contribute to the enhancement of our reputation abroad and among the diaspora. So say all of us, but if they are not broken why are we meddling with them? Why will we potentially destroy the creative spirit within the cultural institutions that has led to those successful initiatives?</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> The amendment welcomes the statement in the programme for Government that the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will make strategic policy formulations the primary function of the Department with line agencies and bodies responsible for policy implementation. That seems to me to diminish our cultural institutions to the role of mere functionaries. Cultural institutions which foster arts, challenge debate and challenge legislators, are designed and dismissed as mere instruments of State, line agencies and bodies. This undermines a magnificent tradition that in some cases predates the origins of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> Those involved in those institutions fostered the ideal of having an independent State at a time when the people were not able to do so themselves. We celebrate the identity and memory of those people in busts and portraits in this Chamber and elsewhere in Leinster House. That is the spirit of thought, belief and creativity that will be undermined by the process now underway, because such institutions will be treated as line agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> The amendment does not answer the request in Deputy Troy's motion to publish the cost-benefit analysis. If this is the road the Department intends to travel, we should at least have a document available to explain the costs and benefits involved. As legislators, we have an interest in the arts sector through the length and breadth of this island. We could challenge and engage with such a document, using it to defend the values and standards of those institutions. The public may not actively participate in them or have access to them, despite the fantastic initiatives of recent years, but many people still hold them dear. Those who work in the cultural institutions are also held in high esteem because they stand up and challenge the country in many ways though creative talent, including new technology. However, all that will be undermined by this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> Our galleries, libraries and museums are all different and have been deliberately constructed to highlight our cultural heritage, including literature. It is said that one pitch does not mean the same games. The Minister will understand that saying more than most. The same applies to our cultural institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> The absence of a cost benefit analysis undermines the extensive consultation process referred to in the Government's amendment. How could it engage in an extensive consultation process without first outlining to those in the sector, and those with an interest in it, the cost benefit analysis in terms of the consequences of its decisions? How can we, in the absence of such document, trust that the Department is taking the proper decisions? How can we believe that there are savings to be made? My colleagues referred earlier to the Canadian example. There are, doubtless, many more examples of where mergers and the undermining of institutions have led to higher cost. In the absence of a cost benefit analysis, we cannot judge or comment on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> If the Department and those who run it have nothing to hide in terms of this process and if, as stated, this is in the interests of governance and public service reform and will support the curatorial independence of the cultural institutions, then the Government should undertake the analysis before making its decisions. It should, before making final decisions, allow consultation around what is contained in that analysis or other documents being used to guide this process. It should allow those in the Visitors Gallery and those throughout this island who are the foundation of the arts community to see the document which will influence their lives, careers and how they imagine this country in the years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> The Government amendment refers to the decade of centenaries, Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union and The Gathering. However, it commits members of the Government to support the undermining of the institutions that will be the flagships of that commemoration process, The Gathering and our Presidency of the Council of the European Union. If we proceed in the direction in which the Department is guiding us, those flagships will hit the sand and with them the aspirations and challenges with which they are supposed to provide us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> As well as undermining our national institutions the Government is dismantling euro by euro - let there be no doubt it, this is what is being done - the CE scheme structure in every county. The CE scheme and its predecessors were the basis on which many community arts facilities got their start. Many community art facilities which are now national and international organisations got their start on the back of an AnCo or FÁS scheme. New facilities will not get that start because of what is happening to CE schemes. While we are undermining these facilities nationally and locally we proclaim ourselves to be an island of scholars and an island of the art. We hold events such as the decade of centenaries and The Gathering and wonder why they do not reach their potential economically. The decade of centenaries has the potential to challenge the achievements of this State. If we undermine our cultural institutions in this way, these events will be nothing but PR spin. </p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> The Minister set me on a road ten years ago, in respect of which, prior to that, I was relatively agnostic. While this is not an area in which I am particularly involved, I have opened my eyes to it. Last Sunday, the Taoiseach opened the new arts centre in Ballina, at which time he referred to this debate and the need for cost savings. While we are all agreed on the need for cost savings, this cannot be achieved in the absence of cost benefit analysis. As Deputy Cowen said, we are lucky that we have in place around the country an outstanding range of county arts committees and county arts officers such as Mr. Alan McCarthy in Mayo and Mr. Seán Walsh who, through a CE scheme and with community support, manages the Ballina arts centre, challenging those of us who live in the area to keep it going. That is what the arts is about. It is about challenge. If we undermine the independence of the arts community and of our cultural institutions which predate the foundation of this State we undermine their capacity to challenge at a time when more than ever we need to do so.</p>

          <from>Deputy John McGuinness<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1020">I compliment Deputy Troy on proposing this motion, which provides us with an opportunity to voice our opinions and concerns and make suggestions on this particularly important topic. This debate is long overdue. During the course of many debates in this House, be it on the economy or social issues, the arts and culture, which are so important to this country and to every county, are left behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> I did not know when I stood beside the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, last weekend at Kilkenny Castle that we would be having this debate. I listened to what the Minister had to say when in Opposition and at some of the events which he attended, in particular those in Kilkenny. I do not question his passion or understanding of this area. At the centre of this is reform of the public service. As someone who has spoken about reform and who insists on it - I believe we need to reform most of our institutions in terms of costs and so on - I believe that we need to look at this area in the context of the value of the organisations and boards in place, what they have achieved and how best we can reorganise them. I have consulted with many people involved in those boards, be it in regard to arts, culture and so on. They understand the economics of all of this and the difficult space we are now in. They also understand the need to get greater value for money and for greater efficiencies in terms of the work they are doing. They are willing to contribute and to participate in that reform. The only question in this regard is how the Government achieves this while maintaining the independence of that group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> I witnessed the growth over many years of the Kilkenny arts festival and the growth in community interest in the arts and culture, through which people gained a greater understanding of the works of Tony O'Malley and Elizabeth Cope and so on. Their keen interest in the arts has helped them to understand their own heritage and tradition. Often people participate more fully following that type of experience. It would be damaging for us to interfere with or dismantle anything within that sector that is positive. We can talk about culture and art and the tourism associated with it and what that does for centres like Kilkenny and beyond - every county is now fully understanding in terms of the contribution that art and culture makes to their lives, tourism and the economy locally and nationally - but at the heart of this debate is how the Minister is going to proceed based on what he has heard on his journey around the country. I suggest that he should follow his heart and should not allow the Department, which can often engage in a little empire building, to take control of this valuable resource which it will later present as something quite different, which does not contribute in the way the various organisations currently do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> I have no doubt that if the Minister were to look to the memberships of the various boards he would find there are people who are willing to participate again at no cost to the State. This is where the Minister's energy should be directed in terms of seeking efficiencies, in co-operation with the organisations and communities which represent art and culture in this country. If the Minister does so and sticks with his own beliefs we would have something far more positive at the end of this process than what is currently planned by a Department that is looking at this in the context of quangos, which these organisations are not, and the savings that can be achieved. Perhaps there will be no savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> In terms of reform, the Minister will need all the facts and figures. I would like to be convinced by what he is going to do. I am sure the Minister would like Members across the political divide to be convinced about what he is going to do. </p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Dinny McGinley)<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1025">Tá áthas orm deis a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá maidir leis an rún atá roimh an Teach seo anocht agus a bhí roimh an Seanad níos luaithe inniu. I am delighted to be here this evening to respond on behalf of the Government on this matter. To begin, I want to reiterate what the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, said yesterday. It is a sign of vitality in our democratic system that the subject of debate in both Houses this evening is our national cultural institutions. It bodes well for a society when its parliamentarians are so engaged on issues of cultural heritage and artistic importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026"> Our arts and culture define us as a nation. They set us apart. They, above all, are what reveal us to the rest of the world. Our excellence in these fields has been constant in a churning world of change. I listened intently to the debate yesterday and earlier today and I acknowledge the contributions from both sides of the House. Having said that, we cannot forget or overlook the fact it was the former Government which authored the strategy of amalgamations and mergers in our national cultural institutions. They left this matter unfinished and the national cultural institutions in a state of uncertainty. In an act of nothing less than pure politics it has presented this motion in its ongoing attempt to whitewash its history of neglecting these matters in the past. However, I agree with one thing said by Deputy Martin yesterday which has been echoed by other speakers, that our national cultural institutions are intrinsic to our history and we should seek to leverage them as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> Ours is a Government that has put culture at the heart of business and slowed the rate of decrease in funding available to the national cultural institutions. This is a Government that is not afraid to embrace a process of reform where such reform is necessary. I am afraid the Opposition parlayed many half-myths in its contributions to this debate. The notion there has not been consultation with the sector is simply derisory. The Department, the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, and the officials have engaged extensively with all of the national cultural institutions, their chairs and boards and the wider stakeholding community on the public service reform plan. I have great admiration for the officials at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht who deal with culture, heritage and the language, the work in which they have engaged for many years, their commitment and goodwill and their realisation of how important a part of our country this is.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028"> The Opposition has introduced a veritable quota of red herrings to the discussions. The arm's length principle is bandied about with a lack of understanding. This principle is enshrined in the Arts Act 2003. The arm's length principle is not at issue in the context of the public service reform agenda. In the same way, the Cultural Institutions Act 1997 and its supposed dismantling was introduced to this discussion by those who oppose for the sake of opposition. Again, we did not introduce this into the discussion. Many Deputies spoke about the impact of the arts and culture in our regions and throughout our country and this is very true. It is the arts and culture that animate our towns and cities each evening. They are an irreplaceable part of our community and will remain so through the lifetime of this Government and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029"> Some Deputies raised the putting in place of an independent recruitment process for chief executives and directors of cultural institutions. There is one in place in the Public Appointments Commission, and it has been used by the Department and the cultural institutions in all recent recruitments including the directorships of the National Concert Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Ireland and the Arts Council. This process will also be used in the upcoming open competition for the directorship of the National Museum. All of these appointments have been made during the term of this Government. The suggestion that we are seeking to dismantle independent recruitment simply does not stand up in light of this fact. Furthermore, the board appointments made by the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, and I since we came to office were all publicly advertised on the Department's website and expressions of interest were sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030"> I was particularly taken by the contributions of Deputies Catherine Murphy and Maureen O'Sullivan on the work of the National Archives and I join them in congratulating the acting director and her staff on the wonderful job they are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031"> At a time of ongoing economic difficulty, we want to examine the governance of institutions and consider how boards or advisory groups might perform a more outwardly proactive and international role in terms of fund-raising and philanthropy. Where these institutions are virtually 100% funded by the taxpayer, the Government has a responsibility to subject them to periodic review. Some commentary in this House and outside has focused on the curatorial and programming independence of the institutions. There is no question of these being undermined. These institutions perform a very important role and manage on our behalf a priceless resource. The Government wants to ensure they can work in the most effective and efficient way possible for today, tomorrow, and the generations to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> Some recent commentary has suggested we are planning to effectively dismantle the national cultural institutions. We are planning no such thing. However, the challenge we are faced with is how to ensure Ireland's national cultural institutions can optimise the funding they receive from the taxpayer and be equipped to deal with the range of issues which will arise in the future. One of the simplest ways in which we can help the institutions to work in a more effective, efficient and co-operative way is to encourage them to share common services.</p>

          <p eId="para_1033">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this very timely debate. I was first elected in 2007 and I do not recall a previous Private Members' motion on the arts, heritage or culture and it is very opportune that we having this debate this evening. There is a large amount of cross-party common ground which is good to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> I have no doubt about the Minister's commitment to the arts. Anybody who follows him in a cursory fashion as I do as he travels to his home constituency of Kerry will see the many occasions on which he stops in Limerick county and city. I am particularly taken with the fact that he does not attend the high-profile places. He attends the lesser-known institutions involved in the performing arts, museums and cultural centres. This is very welcome and it is very refreshing. It was very noteworthy that when he launched his book in Limerick he went to the Frank McCourt Museum in Limerick city. It raised the event's profile. I do not know whether the Minister raised Frank McCourt's profile or whether he raised the Minister's profile; perhaps it was a 50:50 arrangement.</p>

          <p eId="para_1036">I attended it and it was a very nice event and the public reciprocated accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037"> I acknowledge the very fine work of the arts officers throughout the country who work with local authorities through the county and city arts committees. Some of the work they do is largely unknown and it is opportune that we mention it in the Dáil. I will give an example of what is done by the arts officer and arts committee in Limerick. They work in the hospitals, particularly in the children's unit of the Mid-Western Regional Hospital. They go in and shine a light in the lives of young children who are severely sick and who are long-stay patients. They use the arts to bring a degree of relief and happiness to those sick and suffering pain. Very fine work is also done by the arts officers in the antenatal unit of the Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038"> It is noteworthy the County Limerick Youth Theatre receives huge support as does the County Limerick Youth Choir. We all speak about the promotion of sport, and it is a major part of our culture and heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">Those involved in the arts have a significant programme which they roll out right around my county of Limerick. They participate and get involved in 85 of the 115 primary schools across the city and county of Limerick. That is hugely beneficial to our younger people, many of whom do not engage in sport because it does not turn them on. It has to be recognised in this House that artistic and cultural activities offer a worthwhile and fulfilling pastime to such people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> The festival outreach programmes that our arts officers engage in up and down the country are hugely important. Now that we are in the summer season, fleadhanna cheoil and traditional music festivals are kicking off up and down the country. We often talk about the economic spin-off of such events, which are of significant importance to our small towns and villages. The support that festivals receive from arts officers is immense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> There has been some unwarranted criticism of the role of the arts in major infrastructural projects. I have heard people in this House ridicule some of the roadside art that was installed when the motorway programme was being rolled out and roadway schemes were being finished. That is very regrettable because we should all appreciate these important features of our road network. I will give an example in my own constituency. A fine piece of art on the Croom bypass, which is part of the main road from Limerick to Cork, depicts the mill wheel on the River Maigue and a leaping salmon, which are synonymous with the town of Croom in County Limerick. It is important to give people an appreciation of the culture and heritage of our towns that are being bypassed. The criticism of this very positive programme has been undue and unwarranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> Many of our debates focus on funding, but the support given to the performing arts in our theatres has to continue. There are less well-known theatres in every county, such as the Friars' Gate theatre in Kilmallock and the Honey Fitz theatre in Lough Gur, both of which are in County Limerick. A former Church of Ireland church - St. John's church in Knockainey - has also been taken over for these purposes. All of these theatres are important. They have to receive State support where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> The connection between our museums and our heritage has not been mentioned to any great extent during this debate. There are hugely important medieval sites in County Limerick towns like Adare, Kilmallock and Askeaton. It is right that such sites are used by those involved in the performing arts to hold summer festivals or put on summer productions. The continuing support that is being rolled out by the Office of Public Works has to be mentioned. The OPW has done immense work to restore these sites and make them accessible to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> I would like to mention some of the museums in County Limerick. When one thinks about museums in the county, one tends to focus on better-known museums like the Foynes Flying Boat Museum. It is a huge testament to the community in Foynes that the museum has received millions of euro in State investment. The Hunt Museum is another example of a high-profile museum. I remind the House of the existence of less well-known museums like Limerick City Museum. It is also worth mentioning that one of the flagship artefacts on display in the National Museum in Dublin - the Ardagh Chalice - was found in County Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> I would like to conclude by suggesting that the Government made a mistake when it separated tourism from arts, culture and heritage, all of which previously comprised a single Department. I accept that tourism is a much larger portfolio. The link with tourism is a vital part of the funding of arts, culture and heritage projects across the country. If I were to criticise the direction that is being taken, I would say that the links that were in place previously might need to be restored. I recognise the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, to this area. We need more debates of this nature to allow us to recognise the fine work, much of which is offered on a voluntary basis, that is being done by people associated with the arts throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1046">I welcome the members of the arts community who are in the Gallery tonight. I am delighted to wrap up this debate. I thank every Deputy from all parties and none who contributed to it. Many Deputies spoke in favour of the motion. The speakers on the Government side who seemed to castigate us for introducing this motion agreed that our cultural institutions need to have autonomy and independence. I reiterate what my party leader said last night. Although the previous Government indicated that it intended to produce a Bill to provide for amalgamation, it never happened. The general scheme of the Bill had not been approved by the time Fianna Fáil left office. The previous Government did not agree any changes in this regard. I do not think we should apologise for the policy we are espousing tonight, having consulted the arts community. I am a Front Bench spokesman for my party, but I was not a member of the previous Government. I do not feel ashamed about introducing this motion, which supports the arts sector and the retention of the independence of our cultural institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> Fianna Fáil has a proud record with regard to the arts. We introduced the artists' exemption and the tax relief for the film industry. We invested in many venues throughout the country. We opened the arts to the wider community. If I was to speak about the policy changes that have been made by this Government since last year's general election, I would use most of the time available to me. The Government promised that not another red cent would be given to the banks. It said that student fees would not be increased. It promised to abolish upward-only rent reviews. On the specific motion before the House this evening, in its election manifesto Fine Gael committed to the arm's length principle, which has been upheld by successive Governments over 60 years. A great deal of legislation has been introduced over the years to enshrine in law the principle of the independence of our cultural institutions.</p>

          <p eId="para_1049">That freedom is especially important in the arts. The competencies, expertise and networks at director and board levels within our cultural institutions are of critical importance. I agree with the Minister and some of his Government colleagues who mentioned last night that the arts have always been dealt with on the basis of consensus. That is why we are asking Members to support our motion. I acknowledge the commitment to the arts that has been shown by the Minister since he took office last year. He protected the arts budget last year by ensuring it was reduced by just 3%. I would be failing in my duty as an Opposition spokesperson if I did not use this platform to open a debate in this House on an issue that is being widely debated in the arts community. Last night, the Minister appeared to be taken aback about the fact that people have highlighted this issue through the media. I remind him that people are entitled to avail of their right to freedom of speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> In November of last year - almost nine months ago - the Government published a public service reform plan that included proposals for certain cultural institutions to be merged. Since then, it has wasted an opportunity to engage meaningfully and purposefully with the interested parties and the general public. Many of the fine institutions in question, which belong to the people of the Republic, predate the founding of the State. I believe they will be around for a long time after we are gone. The secret discussion and consultation that has been initiated by the Government in recent months came about following political pressure and the high-profile resignation of Professor Diarmaid Ferriter from the board of the National Library. The Minister said last night that this approach needs to be taken for economic reasons, as a consequence of the economic mismanagement of recent years. I was disappointed this evening to hear Deputies comparing cuts in arts funding to reductions in other services. I suggest that is like comparing apples and oranges. These mergers will not generate any savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">They are a box-ticking exercise so that the Minister can go back to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and say he has reduced the number of boards within his Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_1053">These are not quangos; they are our cultural institutions and they are doing a fantastic job. Cultural tourism contributes €2 billion annually to our economy. There were more than 1 million visitors to the National Gallery last year. This is not about money, as both I and members of the arts community have stated repeatedly. They want to engage with the Minister and bring about real reforms that will generate greater efficiencies and cost savings while at the same time maintaining their independence. I reiterate what I stated last night - the National Gallery, IMMA, and the Crawford Gallery have all made submissions to the Minister's Department on how they can achieve greater efficiencies by utilising backroom services and shared resources. The Minister is on record as stating this was a good document.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> We are talking about what effectively will be a Government decision. The Minister has the ideal opportunity. This is his Department, he is the Minister, the person elected by the people. I know he feels it is an honour to serve as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. He, not any unelected bureaucrat or official, has the responsibility to drive policy in his Department. The buck stops with him and the Minister should not renege on that. It is his opportunity to pursue his policy. I do not doubt his commitment to the arts. In his election manifesto he stated he would maintain the arm's length principle in respect of our cultural institutions and he is now in a position to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> On this side of the House, that is all we and the people within the cultural institutions are seeking. They realise savings must be made and they cannot be exempt from any reviews. What they want, what is crucially important in the interests of our cultural institutions, is that each institution should retain its own autonomy and independence. They can only do so by retaining their own boards and directors and ensuring open competition for all future appointments of directorships of our cultural institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> Last night the Minister mentioned an advisory group. I became worried when I heard that. Will he propose an advisory committee of the one-size-fits-all kind, and that this one advisory committee will advise our all cultural institutions? That will not work because the board of each institution has a skill set, the scholarship and the expertise relevant to the institution of which it serves. That apart, the boards also play a pivotal role in securing sponsorship and fund-raising and at looking at ways to reduce their financial dependence on the State. This will all be lost if the Minister proceeds as planned.</p>

          <p eId="para_1059">Another two minutes will do. Board members are honoured and privileged to serve and share their expertise towards the protection and enhancement of our cultural institutions. They are not on the boards for any financial remuneration. Do not tell me that Professor Diarmaid Ferriter was on the board of the National Library for financial remuneration or that Paul McGuinness, the manager of U2, one of the greatest and most successful bands in the world, was on the board of the Arts Council for financial remuneration. I use these people only as examples - like so many others they are on the boards to give of their expertise to a field they know best.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> I listened to Deputies on the other side of the House last night who criticised us for introducing this motion, claiming we were simply playing politics as normal, offering opposition for the sake of it.

          <p eId="para_1062"> Given the party whip system, our motion will not be carried. I am pleased that so many Government Deputies spoke positively to this motion.

          <p eId="para_1326">I believe there is an urgent need for the Minister to make a very strong case in Brussels for an increase in the <i>de minimis</i> provision to which I referred earlier. I suggest that he might consider a figure which I tried to have agreed the last time this issue was under discussion, namely, a minimum provision of €500,000. If such freedom was given we would be able to make companies grow more rapidly than is possible at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327"> The Minister announced this initiative in May 2011 and when this Bill is passed there will still be considerable work to be done before the scheme becomes operable. I would be interested to hear how, despite all the promises given over the past year and a half, when this would all happen. Members of the public will want to know when they can they apply for and receive microfinance for their business. The Minister will also decide how much money can be borrowed by an individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">Many a person has set up a business only to realise when the business was operational that they had not provided for all the necessary equipment or costs in their set-up plan. Whether one is building a house or setting up a business, it is common to find that people have not provided for every contingency. The ability to get a second loan to allow a person to correct deficiencies in the original plan is very important. We have to take some risks, and I will discuss that later.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329"> A micro enterprise is defined as an enterprise with less than ten employees and a turnover of less than €2 million per annum. There is a huge discrepancy between that definition, particularly with regard to turnover, and the idea that average loans of €16,000 and a total loan fund of €10 million per year will be sufficient. I doubt that €16,000, €20,000 or even more will be adequate for setting up a company with a turnover of €2 million. We must be concerned about a much wider issue here. If the banks were functioning properly, the need for micro finance would not be so acute. There would be a one-stop-shop called the bank, whose job is to lend money to people who have a reasonable proposition with a reasonable chance of success. We established the Credit Review Office and I would be interested to find out from that office, where it has overturned the decisions of banks, how successful the businesses concerned were, in other words, whose was the right call.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330"> One experience which I found frustrating when I was looking for money from the banks in the past, and I do not know if matters have changed dramatically since, was that they could be quite slow before making a decision not to lend the money. No detailed explanation was given about where they saw a deficiency in one's plan. In hindsight, they were sometimes probably right to turn down applications I sent to them on behalf of the business for which I was working. Perhaps we had not figured things out, but if they had explained the deficiencies or weaknesses and why they were not giving the loan, we might have been able to address those weaknesses and we might have had a better business plan as a result. It is important that there is real dialogue and debate between lenders and borrowers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331"> Sometimes in life one is told things one does not like. When that happens one might say: "You are wrong and I am right", but many people will, on reflection, see the merit of a valid point that is made. Many times in my life somebody might have given me advice that I was not expecting and perhaps I was not initially enamoured with it but, when I reflected on the issue, I saw validity in the point being made and I came back with a better plan. It is not only a question of the banks giving out money but also a question of whether there is real interaction between lending agencies and borrowers and whether they explain the reasons they do not lend money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332"> On the other hand, at the time when I was dealing with the banks, bridging loans against Government grants and so forth were never a difficulty. As long as one instructed the person giving the grant to pay the money directly to the bank, the bridging loan was given as a matter of routine. In recent years however, even before the credit crunch, I have seen people, be they in community bodies or in small businesses, find it incredibly difficult to get what should be the most simple form of credit, a bridging loan against a grant that is due to be paid. There should be a checklist of required documentation and so forth and the bridging loans should be given quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333"> As in the 1980s, unemployment is probably the biggest challenge facing this society. The number of people who are unemployed has consequences both socially and from the point of view of health, as well as for the feeling of worth within our community. Work is about more than money. Money is important but work is also about social standing. I am not one of those who believe there are too many people who are in receipt of unemployment assistance who would prefer not to be at work. The cost of spending one's day without anything to do is enormous, because one must amuse oneself all day. The total effect on one's well-being is serious. All the professional evidence shows that people who are unemployed visit the doctor more often, take more medicines, attend hospital more often and, if they are long-term unemployed, they die younger. We talk continuously about the health system but, in fact, this is one matter that would have a huge effect on that system, according to all the available professional evidence. It is one of the really curable conditions. I also understand from the literature provided to me by experts in the field that there is a 99% cure of all these symptoms when people secure employment. We must, therefore, concentrate on creating employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334"> What is the yardstick one should use when one attempts to set up a project? I recall encouraging various people to set up businesses when I was the co-operative manager and we started divesting ourselves of some of our activities. The first obvious requirement is a diversity of projects. When a person makes a success of something in this country we have a habit of saying everybody in the country can make a success of the same business. We saw it happen in the construction sector and in other areas. We glut the market. We even managed to do it with the Connemara ponies in recent years when they were making money. Everybody got into Connemara ponies. We must be very careful to ensure that where sectors are successful we do not try to push everybody into them, because that will also create a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335"> I have always believed that the second requirement for a project is that before one looks at the finances or the details, one must ask if the proposal makes sense. In other words, when one stands back and looks at it, is it a sensible thing? Has one some natural advantage, be it of knowledge or access to raw material, that makes the proposal sensible? I have seen proposals come forward and it did not make sense that they could ever be sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336"> Finally, the ultimate test I always had was the person. Two people could be given the same conditions and one will make a go of it but the other will not. We must consider whether we are doing enough to attract the people with that magic ability to run a business. They are few and far between. It is the native skill of how to run a business. Sometimes it is not a matter of education. these issues come before finance. Finance is the last issue because if one does not have a good business there is no point in talking about finance. However, when it comes to finance, I believe it should be a mixture of equity finance, grants and loans, and there must be a proper proportion between the three.</p>

          <p eId="para_1339">I welcome the Bill and the Minister's commitment that employment will continue to be the Government's top priority. This Government is committed to jobs but I ask the Minister to tell his Cabinet colleagues that rather than carry out the budgetary process in public and on the airwaves of our national broadcaster they might do it privately in the Cabinet room. That would do us all a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340"> The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has gone about his business quietly. He is committed to small and medium enterprises and to indigenous industry. The Minister is correct. Rebuilding the foundations of the economy requires changing the way we operate in terms of our small and medium enterprises but that requires working banks that lend to and work with business. It requires us having sustainable businesses. It requires having entrepreneurs with ideas who are risk takers, about whom Deputy Ó Cuív spoke, and the need to work with them. We must help those people and not put a barrier in their way. The Taoiseach has spoken about this country being the best country in the world in which to do business. That is the task we have been given.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341"> The Minister spoke about creating a strong indigenous industry, stimulus and creating jobs. That is what we must do, and it requires our banks to work with people, but what Ulster Bank has done this week is reprehensible. It is unacceptable that the bank has gone into hiding and today, Wednesday, we still have not got an answer to the problem. Those are the banks that our businesses require to work with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342"> Enterprise Ireland today announced record exports of €15.2 billion. That is an extraordinary result which shows the importance of the indigenous industry and that it is, as the Minister correctly stated, central to achieving growth in jobs in our country. That is the reason it is important that we work with and pass this Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343"> It is extraordinary that there are no Members in the House other than Government Members. What does that say about the jobs issue? It says there are four Government Members who are prepared to come in here at 9.40 p.m. to speak about this Bill because we understand its importance. We do not want to engage in rhetoric but speak about the importance of seeing people who emigrated return here and those who went abroad to start up businesses coming home to reinvest in our own country. </p>
          <p eId="para_1344"> This Bill is about helping indigenous small business and the domestic market. In its budget last year this Government rightly targeted the hospitality sector. In terms of the spin-off, Deputy Griffin is aware of it in Killarney and Kerry South. I am aware of it in the city of Cork and in west Cork. Restaurants in Cork are now employing more people. They have better offers. One can go into Cork city on a week night and get three courses of quality food for €20 because this Government took an initiative to attract people to this country. Similarly, as we saw today, the thriving export market is an indication that we can work, and we must build on our domestic market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345"> I fully agree with the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, that small businesses, or microenterprises as we now call them, are the catalyst to getting our country and our economy moving. That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346"> The fundamental point is that we must go back to our banks, which I believe are codding all of us in the way they are not working with people or allowing any leeway in terms of different types of loans, overdrafts and working capital. They are penalising harshly the small and medium enterprises. I know there are some who are starting up who are being squeezed, so to speak, and are finding it difficult but we must reward them and give them opportunities to grow and develop. Otherwise, we will be stagnant and there will be no further growth. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak.</p>

        <speech by="#AnthonyLawlor" eId="spk_545">
          <from>Deputy Anthony Lawlor<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T21:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1347">I am delighted to speak on the Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill which is a welcome addition to the work we must do to increase the number of people who are back in employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348"> Deputy Buttimer remarked that there are not many Opposition Members present. I recall Deputy Wallace mentioning on a number of occasions when he stood to speak in the Chamber that there were no Members present to listen to him. I assume he is at his VAT free wine bar tonight looking at us on a screen, but we will keep going. </p>
          <p eId="para_1349"> I welcome that the Minister is providing funding and that, most important in that regard, he will able to leverage additional funding associated with it from the European Investment Fund. I welcome also that the Minister has involved the county enterprise boards. As a former member of a county enterprise board I thought the work they were doing was extremely worthwhile in grant aiding small businesses to get up and running. </p>
          <p eId="para_1350"> I would like the Minister to take on board the following proposal regarding young people, which he might bring forward in an amendment. Statistics show that 33% of young people, those under the age of 25, are unemployed. They are a vital sector for the future of the country but with 33% of them unemployed we must examine ways in which we can get them back to work. Many of those young people have entrepreneurial skills. It is a well known fact that since 2008 when figures were prepared there has been a 50% drop in the number of young people who got involved in small enterprises who have shown they have entrepreneurial skills. What is the reason for that 50% drop? Is it because banks have ceased lending to young people and are not willing to take a risk with young people with good ideas? Prior to 2008 banks were taking risks with those young people. Some of them will fail and some will progress, and as a result the banks are reducing the amount of money they are lending to young people with good ideas. The result is a 50% drop in the number of young people starting up their own enterprises. What can we do to return to the number that pertained in 2008? Would it be possible to ring-fence some of the fund that will be available to microenterprises specifically for people under 25 years of age? I will give the Minister a good reason for doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351"> The county enterprise boards run a student enterprise scheme. In recent years thousands of young students and entrepreneurs participated in that scheme. Only last year, Tara Haughton from Kildare set up a company, RossoSolini. The female Members present will be familiar with shoes that have red coloured soles. She came up with that idea and luckily secured finance to pursue it through the county enterprise board. If she was not able to access finance from that source, she would have been unable to export 65,000 pairs of those coloured sole stick-ons. It is people like her for whom we should be providing funding. </p>
          <p eId="para_1352"> The Young Entrepreneur Competition is excellent for people in third level education and below. Some 2,500 young people participated in that scheme last year. To reduce the number of unemployed people under the age of 25, it would be helpful if some of the funding available under the microfinance scheme could be ring-fenced specifically for young people under the age of 25. I hope the Minister will consider bringing forward an amendment in that respect.</p>

        <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_546">
          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T21:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1353">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I commend the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on bringing forward this important legislation. I have worked in the financial services industry for many years and one story has always stuck in my mind, and it is appropriate that I share it with the Minister in the context of this Bill. I once interviewed a married couple who were seeking a small loan to carry out some renovations to their home. The application was assessed and the loan approved. The wife was delighted because she could fix up the house and make it more comfortable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">The husband was somewhat more hesitant. I asked him what was wrong and his reply was: "The banks - They give you an umbrella when the sun is shining, but when the rain comes they take it away." The umbrellas are well and truly gone now. This simple story paints an accurate picture of what has happened in Ireland. At the height of the boom, when the sun was shining, banks lent recklessly, but now when the rain has started and people have fallen on hard times, the umbrella has been taken away.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355"> In the Celtic tiger years, asset based lending became the norm. The focus moved away from repayment capacity and now we are paying the price. I believe that by introducing the microenterprise loan fund scheme, the Government is providing businesses with much needed financial assistance. The most positive aspect of the scheme is that it will enable entrepreneurs with ideas to access the credit that they require to get their idea up and running. It is hugely important that the Government does its utmost to support small business as they are the lifeblood of our economy. My county, Monaghan, is renowned for its entrepreneurial spirit and the majority of our employment is related to indigenous businesses. The Minister had an opportunity to see this first hand when he visited Monaghan last month and met with a number of local business organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356"> One of the biggest reasons for start-up business failure is poor financial management. People can produce excellent products, but they also need to have the business know-how to manage their finances correctly. If this does not happen, then, unfortunately, regardless of how good the product is, it is inevitable that the business will struggle. The microenterprise loan fund will provide some businesses with the chance that they have been waiting for, but these businesses must ensure that this opportunity is not wasted through poor financial management. I would encourage businesses to use their local county enterprise boards and local enterprise officers who are available to give excellent guidance and assistance. This scheme forms a further part of the Government's plans to get credit flowing to businesses again and will complement other initiatives, such as the credit guarantee scheme and the development capital scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357"> Retaining and creating jobs remains the top priority for Government. There is no doubt that by supporting our small businesses and creating an environment in which they can flourish will in turn have a positive impact on job creation. There are businesses that need access to credit in order to survive, but likewise there are businesses that have diversified and which are turning this recession into a positive by identifying new opportunities. These would be in a position to expand and create jobs if they were provided with the necessary finances. Figures issued today show 2011 as providing a record result for exporters, with over €15.2 billion of exports out of Ireland. The main growth area in exports is with small and medium enterprises, which this fund specifically targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358"> It is worth pointing out that research from the Central Bank has identified Ireland as the most difficult country in the eurozone for small businesses to access credit. We have all been told by our constituents that the banks are simply not lending. Part of the reason for this can be attributed to the fact that they do not have the skills to assess or understand the business propositions that are presented to them. The problem is that when a person with a credible business idea is refused a loan, this can have a very negative impact on his or her confidence. The person may lose hope and instead of creating what could have been a successful business employing others, the likelihood is that he or she will give up all together. The other danger is that if people repeatedly hear that the banks will not lend, they will not even attempt to get their project off the ground. That is the reason schemes such as the micro-enterprise loan fund are vital at this point in time, so that entrepreneurs are encouraged and supported. I reiterate my support for the Bill and commend the Minister for his ongoing efforts in attempting to create a more favourable environment within which small business can operate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Griffin<recordedTime time="2012-06-27T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1359">I warmly welcome this Bill. When enacted, this legislation will provide a vital lifeline to microenterprises that are currently starved of vital credit. The biggest single problem facing our economy and future economic prosperity currently is the lack of credit available to businesses. We have heard many examples of such cases in the contributions made here this evening. This Bill is good news for all those businesses that will come under its remit. A vibrant micro-enterprise sector is crucial to our recovery and to the creation of sustainable jobs, not just in larger urban centres, but all over Ireland and in peripheral areas. This is very important, particularly for rural constituencies where microenterprises offer major opportunities. I support any efforts to help in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360"> I welcome the Minister's action plan for jobs and his efforts to implement the action plan as quickly and thoroughly as possible. This is an ambitious plan with specific targets and a detailed roadmap for getting to where we need to be. This is needed more now than at any time previously in our history. Even in the 1920s, 1950s and 1980s, unemployment was not as bad as it is now. It is timely that we now have such a detailed roadmap for job creation and I commend the Minister and those working with him on that. Hopefully, we will see it fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361"> I would like to give an example of a case in Kerry I came across recently. I met an entrepreneur from west Kerry who set up a very successful business in the past 12 months which is going very well for him. He is now at peak production. Unfortunately, however, he does not have the capacity to expand his business because of a lack of credit and the failure of the banks to lend to him. He is turning away orders currently. Jobs are waiting to be created in his business, but he cannot create them because he does not have access to credit. I hope such an enterprise will benefit from this legislation and that it will help solve his problems and create jobs for people in desperate need of them. Every job created in our economy helps a family. It puts bread on the table, pays bills and sends children to school and college. We need to be conscious of this. A job is not just a statistic; it is a life. We need to do all we can to help create as many jobs as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362"> I am very concerned by the problems and lack of activity in our domestic economy, but I know the Minister is making every effort to try to stimulate activity. I urge him to consider areas outside of the jobs plan. Perhaps he will consider looking at giving further breaks to employers for creating new jobs. I know there are many schemes available currently to employers. However, many employers are not aware of those schemes. A greater effort must be made to create awareness of the various schemes that exist. Recently, I submitted a number of parliamentary questions to the Minister's Department and received some detailed responses which I have circulated to business people in my constituency who were unaware such schemes existed. An effort should be made by the Department to get this information into the public domain so as to ensure the full benefit of the schemes can be exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363"> In the case of new employment, perhaps the Minister should look at giving further breaks, such as PRSI breaks. We should think about the fact we tax people who create new jobs. I agree we need a tax base and the revenue associated with jobs. However, perhaps there is something we can do to make it easier for employers to create new jobs. That is what the economy needs.</p>
