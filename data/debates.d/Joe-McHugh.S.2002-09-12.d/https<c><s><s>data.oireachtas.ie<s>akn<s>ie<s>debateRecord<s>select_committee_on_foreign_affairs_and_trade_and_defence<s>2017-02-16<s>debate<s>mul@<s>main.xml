          <p eId="para_7">I remind members to turn off their mobile phones. On 15 December 2016, the Dáil ordered that the Revised Estimates for Public Services in respect of the following Votes be referred to this committee for consideration: Vote 27 - International Co-operation and Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade. We will consider these Revised Estimates today and report back to the Dáil. I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development, Deputy McHugh. I also welcome the departmental officials and thank them for their briefing in advance of this meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> Before we move to the main substance of this meeting, on behalf of the Joint and Select Committees for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence I would like to pass on our condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of our former ambassador to Tanzania, Mr. Lorcan Fullam, who I understand passed away at the weekend. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis. </p>
          <p eId="para_9"> It is proposed that we will deal first with Vote 28 on a programme by programme basis. At the outset of consideration of each of the programmes the Minister will give an overview of the programme and I will then open it up to the floor for questions from members. On completion of Vote 28 we will proceed to Vote 27 and consider it in a similar manner. </p>
          <p eId="para_10"> Before proceeding to the business, I remind members and those in the Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the broadcasting equipment even if on silent mode. I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make any charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Members have received advanced briefing on the various programmes. </p>
          <p eId="para_11"> I now invite the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to make his opening remarks on programme A, the purpose of which is to serve people at home and abroad and to promote reconciliation and co-operation</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">I am pleased to be here. I join with the Chairman in offering my condolences to the family of former ambassador and senior official, Mr. Lorcan Fullam, who came from a very well known, highly respected and well regarded family in Portarlington in my constituency. With the Chairman's consent, I would be pleased to convey the condolences of the committee to his family when I meet them later today.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> In my remarks today I will focus on Vote 28 - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, will later address the committee on Vote 27 - International Co-operation. I may also ask the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, to take any questions relating to diaspora issues, which is part of his portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Vote 28 funds the operation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its network of missions, excluding African missions and Vietnam, which fall under Vote 27. Ireland’s contributions to international organisations such as the UN budget, UN peacekeeping operations, OECD, OSCE, Council of Europe and so on, and a number of programmes such as the emigrant support programme and peace and reconciliation fund, and other programmes in areas such as trade promotion, culture and education. Members will have seen the advance briefing note provided by my Department which summarises the main activities and priorities under each strategic programme. </p>
          <p eId="para_15">For 2017 the committee will be aware that the overall gross estimate for the Foreign Affairs and Trade group of Votes, Votes 27 and 28, is €715 million, compared to €702 million in 2015, an overall increase of €13 million or 1.85%. The increase is in Vote 28, earmarked, in particular, for the passport reform programme, for urgent capital building and security works in our missions abroad, to continue the required investment in modernising the Department's ICT infrastructure and global ICT network and in making some provision for increased operating cost pressures abroad across the diplomatic mission network of some 80 missions across the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The programme structure for Vote 28 has changed slightly from last year to correspond with the Department's new strategy statement for the period 2016 to 2019. The programme structure mirrors the priorities set out in the foreign policy review document, The Global Island: Ireland’s Foreign Policy for a Changing World, which sets out the Department's work in five priority areas: supporting our people; engaging actively in the European Union; promoting our values; advancing our prosperity; and strengthening our influence. These correspond directly with expenditure programmes A to E in the 2017 Revised Estimates Volume. The main change compared with last year is the reordering of programmes B, C and D which were previously programmes D, B and C, respectively. There have also been some transfers of activities between programmes, including the setting up of a new promoting Ireland programme which is now under programme D3 and which explains some of the variations members see in expenditure on individual programmes compared to 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> I will proceed to make some very short introductory comments on programme A. The amount allocated for this programme in 2017 is €79 million compared to €68 million in 2016. The bulk of the additional funds secured in 2017 which I mentioned will be spent under this programme which is about our people - Irish citizens at home and abroad - and covers a number of key priority areas for the Department. Given the breadth of issues covered by the programme, I can only touch briefly on some of them in my short introduction. I am sure the Chairman will moderate discussions on issues members believe are important to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> Providing high-quality consular assistance and other consular services for Irish citizens at home and abroad is a key objective of the Department. As members will recall, extensive arrangements were put in place for the tens of thousands of wonderful Irish, including Northern Irish, fans in France for the European championships, as well as those attending the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil. We responded to major terrorist incidents and launched a new smartphone travel app, Travelwise, which helps to keep Irish citizens informed and safe while abroad. I encourage members to inform their constituents of this app as it is an important source of information for citizens travelling abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> As regards consular priorities in 2017, a new consular strategy is being developed, while a new customer service action plan and consular customer service charter have been adopted. We expect the trend in recent years of a steady increase in Irish people travelling abroad to continue in 2017 and will continue to plan and prepare for Irish citizens attending major international sports and other events in 2017 in focusing on the preventive piece in our work.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The passport reform programme is important to members in the context of their constituency work. In 2016 the Department issued 733,000 passports, representing an increase of more than 9% on the figure for 2016. Applications so far in 2017 are already over 20% ahead of the number in the corresponding period last year. The increase in demand is driven by various factors: a general increase in the number of Irish citizens travelling abroad; a growing population; and a significant rise in application numbers from Northern Ireland and Great Britain. As members may know, just over a year ago I launched a significant investment in the passport service to modernise the issue of passports, improve security and enhance the service provided for citizens. The passport reform programme runs from 2016 to 2018 and involves a combined capital and current budget of €18.6 million. Nearly €8 million has been allocated for the programme in 2017. I acknowledge the professionalism and sense of customer service of Austin Gormley and his team at the Passport Office. One of the most significant innovations will be the introduction in the coming months of an online passport renewal option for adults which will reduce the administrative burden for citizens and improve the overall efficiency of the service. I expect to make a further announcement on this innovation in the next few weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The next heading is the emigrant support programme and diaspora issues which are being handled by Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe McHugh. In relation to Irish communities and individuals abroad, our active work continues to support our most vulnerable emigrants and implement the wider objectives of the Government’s diaspora policy document. Our vision continues to be having a vibrant, diverse global Irish community, connected to Ireland and to each other. I am pleased that the budget allocation to support emigrant communities and wider diaspora engagement remains at €11.595 million for the emigrant support programme and a further €400,000 for diaspora affairs, responsibility for which has been transferred to my Department from the Department of the Taoiseach. I commend the work of my colleague, Deputy Joe McHugh, in this important area in his role as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora. He will take questions members have on these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The Northern Ireland programme deals with matters relating to Northern Ireland and delivers funding for projects to bolster peace and reconciliation on the island. The interests of the island as a whole and protecting the gains of the peace process will remain a priority for the Government in the upcoming Brexit negotiations. The Government's priority is to ensure the Good Friday Agreement and the overall balance of the settlement will not in any way be disturbed by the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and to maintain the open and, effectively, invisible border. </p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The next topic is the reconciliation fund and the related issue of commemorations. Although significant progress has occurred in Northern Ireland, there is still important reconciliation work to be done. The reconciliation fund of €2.7 million is an important expression of our support for this work. Recognising the contribution commemorations can make and drawing on successes in this regard last year, we will support in 2017 the commemoration of Irish involvement in the battle of Messines. </p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I would welcome the comments of the Chairman and members on programme A.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelGrealishPD" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_26">I compliment the Passport Office, the officers of which are absolutely brilliant. I do not know why people still wait until the last minute to renew their passports and book their tickets and hotel accommodation only to get to the airport and find their passports are out of date. I was only let down once by the Passport Office and acknowledge that its staff do excellent work. I welcome the proposal to provide for online renewals. Most people have a car and they receive a letter or an e-mail to advise that their motor tax is due for renewal. There is an e-mail address for every passport holder and an e-mail could be sent every ten years to warn people that their passport will soon go out of date and advise them to renew it.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> There are proposals for works on properties abroad, including security works. Perhaps the Minister might elaborate on them a little. Embassies and other buildings need to be continually upgraded. Are there proposals to open new embassies, given that Britain is due to pull out of the European Union? The British Government looks after some of our interests in some countries. How will this pan out in the future? Will the arrangement continue or is it being proposed to open new embassies?</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The Minister said the Government hoped to keep an invisible border with Northern Ireland. Will this just involve a discussion between the British and the Irish or will the European Union have a say on what will happen on the Border? It is a decision that should be left to us alone, the European Union should have no say.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Have any discussions taken place between the Minister, the Minister of State and the British Foreign Secretary? How will that matter be dealt with? It is crucial for us to have an invisible border there. </p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I will put the question on the Irish Cultural Centre in Boston to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, as the funding of projects abroad come under his remit. I will await his proposals in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">Like Deputy Grealish, I wondered if there are plans to open any further embassies. There is interest from certain countries in having an Irish embassy there.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> I acknowledge the recent visit to Kenya when I was with the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and Mr. Michael Gaffey. It was positive and progressive to see the work of our embassy there under the ambassador, H.E. Vincent O'Neill and the work he is doing to promote Ireland in so many ways. There was an interesting exhibition there about the Irish in Kenya, which was organised by a group of people. It highlighted the contribution that Ireland has made, as well as explaining our international reputation. The exhibition is going to come to Ireland also. That is something that all our embassies could do because Ireland has made such a worldwide contribution. </p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Programme C concerns creating a fairer and more just world, but perhaps the Minister can explain what is involved in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I thank the Minister and Minister of State for attending the committee. As the Minister said, there has been a significant 9% increase in applications for Irish passports totalling 733,000. I also wish to compliment everyone associated with customer services for their work in the Passport Office. I have had many difficult cases at times and the passport staff have always been helpful and supportive. I wanted to put that on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> The Minister also mentioned an increase of 20% in applications this year already. Is that as a result of the Brexit vote concerning Northern Ireland? What is the percentage breakdown of new passport applications from Northern Ireland and Britain so far this year? </p>
          <p eId="para_44"> Representing a Border constituency, my concern is about the effect of Brexit. We must ensure the continuance of the Good Friday Agreement. Is Government funding in place to ensure that Brexit will not have a negative effect? We are talking about hard or soft borders, but nobody knows what the situation will be. Can the Minister expand on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_45">I apologise for being late. I have read the Minister's statement and wish to raise two points. I am sure the Department was aware that there would be an increase in passport applications. I heard on the media this morning that the Minister intends to employ additional staff in the passport service, although that is not specifically alluded to in his address. How many extra staff does he intend to employ? Will he be re-employing those who worked there temporarily over the summer and who are already trained? There is a huge issue with passports at the moment. The Minister and the Minister of State will know that, as I have been plaguing them about it. It is a serious matter. What is the Department doing about the customer service element in advising people of the revised lead times? That is also a big issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> How many staff is the Minister going to employ and how soon does he hope to have them in place? My colleague, Senator Robbie Gallagher, has written to the Minister about opening a sub-office in the Cavan-Monaghan area, so are there any plans to open another passport office?</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Subhead A6 concerns North-South, Anglo-Irish co-operation, but there is no increase in funding between 2016 and 2017. Given that the UK is in the process of exiting the EU and given the political situation in the North, is the Minister satisfied that there is no increase in funding in that area? I would have thought that is something that will keep the Department particularly busy over the coming year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_16">
          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_48">I also wish to record my appreciation for the work of staff in the Passport Office. We are on to it constantly and we appreciate its help. I note the substantial increase in capital funding for office premises. Have there been any successful efforts to reduce the costs of official residences and chanceries?</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> As regards the diaspora, we appreciate the emigrants' support programme. Immigration reform and the political situation in the United States is of concern to many families throughout this country, given the undocumented Irish in the US. Following the Minister's recent visit there, can he see any reasons for optimism about immigration reform in the US?</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> The Peace and Reconciliation Programme has been valuable for the most disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland and the Border area generally. Could any available funding be rolled out as early as possible this year? Many communities in Northern Ireland feel vulnerable at this stage. We cannot quantify the angst and worry for such communities due to the referendum decision on the UK's membership of the EU. A clear message should be sent that our support for various projects will continue. I acknowledge the interaction of the Minister and his ministerial colleague, Deputy Donohoe, at the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We must give strong reassurances that the various programmes funded by the Department and through INTERREG and the peace programmes, will be continued beyond 2020. A message must go out to communities that the valuable supports and programmes that have been in place since the late 1990s will be continued. Many of the most disadvantaged communities have benefitted from those programmes.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_17" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_51">I will deal with the last point first. The Chairman made a good point regarding the importance of funding from the Peace and Reconciliation Fund. I acknowledge the Chairman's comments. It is a vitally important source of funding for many communities that are still suffering from division and are recovering in a post-conflict society. I take the Chairman's point about the early disbursement of funding, but he will be aware that we receive hundreds of applications. It is important that each and every application is gone through in order to ensure that they meet the strict criteria involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> We currently have two funding rounds a year. New applicants are always welcome alongside many of the more established organisations that have benefited and continue to do very good work. The closing date for the receipt of applications for the next round of funding is 10 March, which is approaching. I therefore ask committee members to alert any interested parties at the earliest opportunity. After that March round, the second round will be open in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">I remind members and all interested parties that full details and information regarding the fund and the criteria in respect of application and the manner in which the application can be made are available on the website.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> Deputies Grealish, McLoughlin and Darragh O'Brien asked about passports. Deputy O'Brien mentioned that the central passport location is situated in his constituency. All Deputies will be aware that volumes of passport applications are particularly high at the moment. Deputy Grealish is right in his contention that public representatives should continue to ensure there is a public information campaign that asks people to check their validity of their passports and those of their children. I know the Passport Office will continue to do this. People need to be able to choose the correct passport channel. I think that has given rise to issues in recent times. It is stated on the application form and the website that applicants should not book their travel plans until they have received their passports. My advice continues to be that applicants should allow six weeks for the receipt of their passports in order to ensure there is no disappointment. Queries often arise with regard to application forms. Documentation can be incomplete, or the quality of the photograph might not be sufficient to meet the appropriate security requirements. I advise people to allow six weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> I remind Deputies that citizens who are travelling in three weeks or more can avail of the convenient and cost-effective Passport Express facility, which is available through post offices. At a time when rural Deputies are concerned about the future viability of rural post offices, it is important that this service is provided for through all post offices here and 70 post offices in Northern Ireland. It is important for it to be adequately recognised that the current turnaround time for renewal applications made through the Passport Express facility is 15 working days and not five or ten working days. I ask applicants for passport renewals to regard 15 working days as the appropriate time they should allow to ensure their new passports can be issued and returned to them in time. First-time applications take a little longer due to the additional security checks that are required. In addition to the orthodox passport application area and the passport express facility, a third stream is available to those who need to travel at short notice. We hope to be able to provide a satisfactory outcome in such circumstances within the timeframe that is sought. We advise people who need to make emergency or urgent applications to go online to book an appointment at one of the passport offices in Dublin and Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I acknowledge that this is a very important issue for public representatives. As a Deputy who represents a rural constituency, I am aware that this engagement forms a considerable part of our duties. Later this spring, we will announce online improvements which should considerably benefit citizens in making online applications for passport renewals. I note Deputy Grealish's point regarding e-mail responses. I accept it is important for us to work in that area. We intend to ensure a first-class customer service is available to people who do not have e-mail accounts or may not be living in close proximity to passport offices. The capital funding mentioned by Deputy Darragh O'Brien will allow for the installation of the new advanced computer system. We have received very positive feedback from the public about our new building - Knockmaun House - and its surrounds in Mount Street and the level of efficiency there. At a time when application numbers are high, the staff of the Passport Office and the Department are endeavouring to ensure a first-class level of service is offered to all applicants.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> Reference was made to a spike in passport applications. I acknowledge that there has been an increase. We do not ask people who are filling in passport application forms to state the reasons they are making such applications. Our concern is to ascertain whether people qualify for Irish passports. It is fair to say that there has been a considerable degree of new-found interest in passport applications from Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Most passport applications from both sides of the Border are made through the post office network. That remains the most efficient and effective way to apply for a passport. Applications can be submitted through all post offices in this jurisdiction and up to 70 post offices across Northern Ireland. An online option for passport renewal will be offered to citizens in the next few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> I am satisfied that the existing range of service options meets the current needs of passport applicants. I am not convinced by the arguments made in favour of the proposal to locate new passport offices in certain parts of the country, including those mentioned by Deputy Darragh O'Brien. Proposals have also been made in respect of other parts of the country and places outside this jurisdiction. I am confident that the introduction of the online passport application option will result in an even greater level of efficiency. We will have an opportunity to test this later in the year. I am confident that turnaround times will be reduced further, even in the context of additional applications. I will be happy to keep the matter under review and to take guidance at any point from this committee and its members.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> The proposed withdrawal of the UK from the EU presents us with a monumental challenge over a range of issues, including our invisible Border. I can say in response to the Deputies who asked about the Border that I have raised this issue in my discussions with the UK Foreign Secretary, Mr. Johnson, MP, and the UK Secretary of State for Leaving the European Union, Mr. Davis, MP, who was in Ireland before Christmas. I am in ongoing discussions on this issue with the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, MP, who was in Dublin on Tuesday. I am satisfied that our concerns in this regard have been fully accepted, acknowledged and realised by my UK counterparts. It was significant that in her statement introducing the White Paper that was published by the British Government recently, the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, specifically referenced Northern Ireland and the Border issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> I am aware of the concerns and anxieties in the Border area, particularly in the constituencies of the Chairman and Deputy McLoughlin. This issue is a priority for the Government. We have raised it in our discussions with our UK counterparts. I have raised it with each of my foreign minister colleagues across the EU. The peace process is of fundamental importance. Anything that has an adverse impact on the Good Friday Agreement, or disrupts it in any way, will be wholly unacceptable to the Irish Government. Members will be aware of the excellent great strides that have been made in North-South relations since the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">These strides have been possible because of the invisible nature of the Border that I crossed only last Saturday travelling from Carlingford in County Louth along a minor road into Newry. Members will be aware of the invisible nature of the Border and I have sensitised all my European Union colleagues to that effect. I am satisfied the British Government is aware of the position and we must work towards that. That is in the context of negotiations, which, incidentally, have not yet started. We are not negotiating with the British and we will be negotiating firmly with the EU 27. This issue will form part of the negotiations. Ultimately, it is not something that will be decided by ourselves and the British Government but it will be decided in the context of the negotiation between the European Union and the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> Deputy Darragh O'Brien made a point regarding funding. The North-South Ministerial Council is not currently operating in the manner in which we all would have expected because of the electoral cycle in Northern Ireland and we are now in an election process. I call on all parties involved with the election campaigning that as soon as the results are announced with the votes counted, everybody elected and their respective party leaders should sit around the table at the earliest opportunity to ensure that an Executive can be up and running in a positive and constructive way in Northern Ireland. It is important in itself in the context of the Agreement but there are specific Brexit issues that must be addressed. I am satisfied the level of funding to allow for North-South engagement in the matter of Brexit is sufficient. I acknowledge what is implicit in the Deputy's question, which is the need to ensure we have an intense level of engagement with our UK colleagues and Northern colleagues in the new Executive in order to ensure the priorities of the Irish Government from an all-island perspective are fully appreciated. Those include the maintenance of an invisible Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> I will revert to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's issues in the appropriate programme. I do not envisage cases where our funding will not be continued on the basis of our proposals. We keep our embassy complement under review. There were a number of specific areas where urgent works were required in terms of the safety of buildings; I refer in particular to a programme of work in Paris. There are also a number of embassies where for security reasons we need to update the buildings and their curtilage. That is having regard to a number of international terrorist attacks and we must ensure our people and their teams are safe. That is an ongoing programme but we highlight areas of urgency and importance. Funding is always a matter of challenge in that regard and our embassy network forms part of our ongoing engagement with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. On the matter of new embassies, such issues are always under review. In the context of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, our longer-term review issues might now be subject to a shorter-term review. We must intensify our markets overseas and that will involve the development of further programmes launching early next month. There is also the matter of our trade priorities for the year and we can consider new embassies that we opened in the past 18 months. In this context I refer to areas such as Nairobi in Kenya, Austin in Texas, Hong Kong, Jakarta in Indonesia and Bangkok in Thailand. There are already reports coming in from these embassies that demonstrate a significant amount of activity in terms of bilateral relations with these countries with particular reference to trade and economic development. I will be happy to keep the committee fully informed in that regard. We are looking at other areas. This committee and Members asking foreign affairs questions in the Chamber have made me aware of the political, economic and trade factors with particular reference to Iran and this is under review in line with other areas. In the meantime, the embassy of Ireland in Ankara in Turkey has accreditation to Iran. We are represented in Iran by an honorary consul but we will continue to review matters, having regard to the range of factors we have in considering our diplomatic representation overseas. Deputy Grealish made an important point about our relationship with the UK. In countries where we do not have a resident full-time mission, consular engagement in that regard has been very important and that will continue. However, our relationship with the UK is not the only one we have with like-minded countries. I acknowledge the assistance we get in many countries from the French and German Governments, for example, as well as other EU Governments. I make specific reference, however, to the important engagement and relationship that we have with our nearest neighbour.</p>

I picked the cultural centre in Boston because I have been there and visited it on a number of occasions.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">Last year, €2.3 million went to welfare organisations through our emigrant support programme, which was 70% of the overall programme funding that went to the United States. In San Francisco, there are ambitious plans for remodelling the centre there. We will stay in touch with our consulate and I have asked the group in Boston to stay in touch with the consulate there and ourselves to keep us informed. With regard to the funding for this year, the applications closed yesterday and there will be approximately 400 projects from 200 organisations to be evaluated. I do not know if Boston is in that group but I can find out. The Deputy can ask the group to stay in touch with us and our officials and let us know what are the specific plans. As I mentioned, the group is ambitious and has a fantastic facility. The Deputy has been there and knows about the football pitches. They have brought in different types of activities for young people and it is a great model that we should promote for other centres around the world. It is inclusive and it addresses the generational gap as many centres and communities in the United States find it difficult to get young Irish people involved. That is a great model.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> The Chairman mentioned the undocumented and, as I mentioned, 70% of the funding goes to welfare organisations that support the undocumented. We are looking at extra funding for that. I have been to San Francisco, New York and Boston already and have been working very closely with those organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> At a political level, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade visited Washington from late January to early February, where he met representatives from both sides of the US Senate and Congress. His meetings are a critically important part of the strategic approach that we have adopted to the issue of the undocumented Irish. Ms Anne Anderson, the Irish ambassador to the United States, held a meeting on 12 January that was attended by Senator Billy Lawless and representatives of all our consulates. The Department has adopted a strategic follow-up approach rather than a piecemeal or one-off approach. While I do not want to create an expectation for the undocumented Irish, I note that prior to the new Administration taking office there was fear about the J1 programme. Last night, however, extra J1 places were announced. The point is we have a rich American-Irish relationship that the Minister has nurtured on a weekly basis. </p>

          <p eId="para_72">I thank the Minister for his comments. I note provision has been made for a 7% increase in salaries and wages next year. Perhaps the Minister or Mr. Gormley will answer my questions on staffing. Will the Department advertise for additional staff and if so, how many? Recruitment was reported on RTE, the national broadcaster. Not everything RTE says is true but it might be in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> I wish to comment on the embassy network. Recently Deputy Grealish and I visited Egypt. I want to put it on the record of the House that any time Members of the Oireachtas travel abroad the Irish consular service and people who work in our embassies do exceptional work. In Egypt a small Irish team comprised of an ambassador and consular staff do a superb job in a very difficult situation. Deputy Grealish and I saw at first hand the additional security measures that are required in Cairo. It is not the easiest of working environments. On my own behalf I wish to express my gratitude to the consular service and embassy staff for the work that they do all over the world. I would like to get a handle on how much it costs to provide a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> The Minister of State mentioned the importance of the J1 visa programme and like him, I welcome the additional visas. Yesterday I mentioned the undocumented Irish to the Minister in the Dáil. What is our approach to the undocumented Irish? Perhaps this is not the correct forum to discuss the matter. Are reciprocal visa arrangements along the lines of the Australian deal being considered? Is Ireland still in the overall group of the 12 million illegal or undocumented people in America? Has the Minister sought a specific bilateral arrangement for Ireland? I appreciate that the new Administration is in existence for a short time. What is our approach now? </p>

          <p eId="para_76">As I have mentioned here before, driver licences cannot be renewed online and the situation affects the undocumented Irish in America. A passport is the most important document that a person can have yet it can be renewed online or through the post office. One must show up in person at a particular office to collect a driver licence. It is a huge problem for Irish people who live abroad. Recently I was in Boston to attend a wedding and four young people approached me to tell me they had no driver licences. In America when a police officer stops a person the first thing he or she will ask for is a driver licence. People abroad cannot get a driver licence unless they come home and present themselves at the appropriate office. I ask the Minister and Minister of State to ask the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to put a system in place that caters for Irish people who are abroad, particularly the undocumented Irish people who are in the United States. They are particularly worried now due to the pledge by President Trump to tackle the problem of illegal people in the United States. Can the Minister and Minister of State discuss the matter with their colleagues in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?</p>

          <p eId="para_77">I support the comments made by Deputy Grealish. I am dealing with the case of a young girl who is undocumented and living in America. Unfortunately, she lost her driver licence in America. People can replace their passport and buy it online yet the same cannot be done for a driver licence. Local authorities no longer issue driver licences. The National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, has made no effort to accommodate the people abroad who wish to renew their driver licences. People need their driver licences because they need to drive in the United States and elsewhere. The NDLS will not accept it when people say they have mislaid or lost their driver licences. A driver licence will only be issued after people return home, submit an application, have a photograph taken and return to the United States. It is impossible to do all of that, particularly for the 50,000 undocumented Irish who live in the United States. As I said yesterday, many of these people are very concerned and afraid because of what has been done and said by the new regime in the United States. Two cases have been mentioned this morning but many people are affected by this issue.</p>

Ultimately, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the matter but I am happy to set up a meeting.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">I wish to comment on immigration reform. I had a number of meetings in Washington and I shall mention my meeting with the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Mr. Paul Ryan. For many years he has been familiar with the undocumented Irish and I acknowledge his support.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> It is early days for the new Administration in the United States and we cannot say for certain what the programme of work will be for the coming year. I can tell members that Mr. Paul Ryan said to me, having regard to his influential position as Speaker, that he expects that the undocumented will be tabled on the agenda in the latter half of this year. I agree with Deputy O'Brien that it is early days for the US Administration. I felt that it was important for me to avail of an early opportunity in the life of the Administration to speak to figures who will play an important role. We will keep in contact with the US Administration at the highest level. I cite the Taoiseach's visit for St. Patrick's Day and note the opposing commentary on same. It is important that the Taoiseach avails of every opportunity, as do all Ministers, as well as members, including this committee, to contact people who we believe will be in a position to advocate, assist and help resolve this issue that has lasted for a number of decades. I am happy to keep the committee fully informed about the matter. I note that individual members, as well as this committee collectively, will have an opportunity to continue what is a very important engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> Irish people who have lived in the United States for many years are stakeholders in the United States on the basis that they pay their taxes, raise their families and engage in business, commerce and trade. While they are an integral part of US society and contribute to the US economy, their papers are such as to give rise to very serious concerns on their part as to their status and future. It is important that the situation is fully recognised in the context of whatever legislative changes are brought forward. The indications are that this may happen this year. </p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Deputy O'Brien raised two specific issues about budgets and staffing. Over the coming months in excess of 230 temporary clerical officers will be recruited for the Passport Office. Many of them will have previously worked in the Passport Office, which is important in the context of training and efficiencies. That is the expectation but the situation is always under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> On the matter of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, members will be aware of the reconfigured nature of Departments internally. I refer to both the Department of the Taoiseach and my Department. We now have a dedicated Brexit unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and we have managed to increase our footprint in the form of personnel, particularly in our PermRep in Brussels. Consideration is being given to embassies in London, Paris and Berlin. On the matter of London, I acknowledge the increased presence on the ground of agencies such as IDA Ireland and our embassy to ensure we maximise opportunities that may arise on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> It is fair to say we have all been concentrating on the adverse impact and the negatives. I do not envisage much of an upside for anybody on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. I said that during the course of the campaign and since the referendum. I fully respect the wishes of the British people as expressed in the referendum. It could well be, in the context of the withdrawal, that there will be an opportunity for Ireland, especially in financial services and related areas. We have augmented our agency staff to ensure we are prepared for these opportunities as they arise. More than 600 people attended a very successful financial services day or seminar in Dublin Castle recently. It was addressed by the Taoiseach and Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who has been particularly active in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">Programme B, which was previously programme D, provides the framework for the Department's role in securing Ireland's influence in the EU outcomes through maintaining and growing strong relationships with the EU institutions and other member states. Some of this has already been addressed. The focus of work under the programme will be on safeguarding Ireland's interests in the broader context of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and the negotiations we expect to commence properly later this spring. The allocation for this programme in 2017 is €23.3 million, compared with €19.3 million in 2016. That is an increase of €3 million, which reflects the priority attached to Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> The Government is under no illusion about the nature and scale of the Brexit challenge. Our preparations began more than two years ago. We enter the negotiations in a position of strength. Within my Department, a team of experienced senior officials, both in Dublin and abroad, is continuing to prepare intensively for what will be complex and detailed negotiations. Additional capabilities and resources are being assigned to cover the complex process of the withdrawal. Within the Department, additional resources have been assigned to the two key divisions, the EU division and the Ireland, UK and the Americas division, IUKA. In addition to extra posts at headquarters, specific additional staff have been assigned to our embassies in London, Berlin and Paris in addition to Brussels, as I stated. Every Department has developed a thorough impact assessment or analysis of the critical issues that need to be addressed. I have referred in the Dáil and this committee to my engagement at EU level. I will be happy to take questions in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> Deputy Darragh O'Brien should note an allocation of €325,000 is included under this programme to support our EU engagement. This programme was transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach for 2017. This programme is also used to fund projects and proposals which further Ireland's EU related foreign policy priorities across a range of organisations. I will take questions and comments.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">I welcome the Minister's statement that there is a dedicated Brexit unit in the Department and that it has been possible to increase the number of personnel in key embassies. The brief we got from the Department states funding for Brexit related activities across programmes will impose resource challenges on the Department this year. I hope there will be adequate resources to deal with this very important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> When colleagues of the Minister from the Foreign Affairs Council visit this country and are meeting, I hope they will go outside the capital to the Border. I welcome the fact the President of the Bundestag is visiting the Border area next week. He will be in the Dundalk area along with colleagues from the Bundestag. While we can all read memos and files and go to capital cities and hear about the challenges facing countries, there is nothing to beat going to the coalface and meeting the people who will be directly affected by what will happen in a few years. I acknowledge there are time constraints when Ministers visit other countries but I hope that, where possible, colleagues and people of influence from other member states will be brought to the Border. Let them see that we have, thankfully, made so much progress and that we do not want to undo it. When a person exits County Cavan into County Fermanagh, he or she does not know it unless he or she is a local with local knowledge. This represents a huge change from the era in which people such as I grew up. We have seen significant changes since the late 1990s.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">I know the answer the Minister will give to my question, that is, that our neutrality is respected and intact. That there is a mandatory contribution, in addition to a voluntary one, under the common foreign and security policy raises issues. We cannot ignore what has been brought to light regarding what has been happening in Shannon. I know the Minister will tell me our neutrality is not in danger of being undermined but the reality is as I have described.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">I welcome the comments the Minister made on Brexit. It is time we talked it up and not down. There is enough negative talk regarding Brexit.

          <from>Deputy Tony McLoughlin<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_99">Last Friday night, I held a meeting in Sligo on Brexit. It was attended by the Taoiseach and Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP. There was a wide-ranging discussion and questions and answers. Various groupings were involved. One of the speakers was an employer of a number of drivers in the haulage business. Nobody realises the implications Brexit may have, including in the Chairman's area. I refer to the travel time implications when travelling from North to South and across Europe as a result of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> Many other issues were raised at the meeting. On the educational side, the president of Sligo IT indicated he could see pluses for Sligo in the educational field.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> Agriculture is a major concern. There were a number of representatives from the agriculture community present on Friday night and they highlighted their concerns. There are no borders at present and the new Border arrangement is an unknown quantity at this stage. This is a considerable concern for everybody in trade and business. Perhaps the Minister will make a statement on that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_41">
          <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_102">The Minister indicated in his statement that he has spoken at least once to every other EU foreign Minister. That is crucial. I know he intends to keep that engagement going. How many bilateral meetings does the Taoiseach have left to do with his counterparts? I understand from questions to him yesterday that he may have done one third of the meetings. What plans are there to ramp up this process? It is difficult when he has to keep his eye on things here and abroad but anyway, that is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> Does the Minister have an indication of the position from the British Government? The British Government had mentioned March as the time to table the Article 50 letter. Has the British Government given an indication as to whether the date will be put back somewhat? What is the EU's view? I get a sense that the EU is pushing to have this dealt with far quicker.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> Another question relates to the special status for Northern Ireland. I met the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland the day before yesterday. I put it to him that I and my party were particularly disappointed and dismayed that the British had rejected out of hand any notion of special status for Northern Ireland. I asked the Minister this question yesterday. I am trying to clarify the position of the Irish Government on special status for Northern Ireland. I took it from our debate in the Dáil yesterday that we seem to be in agreement with the British on that point. I hope that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> I have another question on the trade side following from the remarks of Deputy McLoughlin. This area is crucial as well. While there are many risks to all sectors, there also are many opportunities. How is the Department tracking the various issues in each sector? This is a vast issue. Deputy McLoughlin referred to haulage but this applies to any sector. I met representatives from Horse Racing Ireland last week. Some things we would never think about are impacted because of Brexit. Is an inventory of the issues in the various sectors being updated on a regular basis? How is the Department tracking things to be able to deal with them? I will not even go into examples because the Minister knows what I am talking about. Anyway, it is vast and I still am concerned that we do not have the resources. While an additional €325,000 appears to have been allocated to support EU engagement, who is keeping the ledger in respect of resources on the administrative side in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade? Who is keeping an inventory of the various issues with which every Department must deal? I will leave it at that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_42" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_106">I will deal with the question raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan first, in which she made reference to the number of organisations under the programme to which we make a contribution. The organisation with the greatest emphasis in this regard, perhaps, is the United Nations. This is crucial to our people. In none of our engagements with any of these international committees or organisations has the issue of Irish neutrality been in any way compromised. Our position regarding our non-aligned status and the fact that we are not members of any military organisation are accepted among the international community.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> We have seen the publication in recent times of our new foreign policy review and strategic plan. Specific reference is made to Ireland's neutral status. Our engagement with the EU common security and defence policy, CSDP, is an integral part of the foreign and security policy of the European Union. It provides the European Union with operational capacity to undertake missions outside the European Union for peacekeeping, conflict prevention and the strengthening of international security in accordance with clearly laid down principles of the United Nations contained in a charter. We remain strong supporters of CSDP initiatives, which continue to improve the capacity of the European Union to make contributions to international security, peace and stability, especially in the context of support for the United Nations. In this regard, we will continue to work closely with EU member states. However, I wish to assure Deputy O'Sullivan, as I have done on numerous occasions previously, of the importance and the international recognition of our stated status of being militarily neutral.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> I am keen to address the Chairman's important and positive suggestion. He suggested that international visitors, especially EU foreign ministers, who will have an important role to play in the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, might have an opportunity to visit a Border area. I think that is an excellent suggestion and I would be happy to follow up on that. I am expecting a visit shortly from the EU foreign minister from Luxembourg. I would be happy to give consideration to arranging a visit for him to a Border area. He comes from a small but nevertheless influential state in the European Union. Indeed, it is one of the founding members. Luxembourg experiences in excess of 50,000 people per day crossing the invisible borders from Germany, Belgium and France for work, education and engagement. I would be happy to try to arrange an opportunity for him to visit a Border area.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> Last week, I had the opportunity for the first time to meet the key European Parliament figure, Guy Verhofstadt, on a bilateral basis. I issued a formal invitation to him to visit Ireland and engage. This may be an opportunity to invite Mr. Verhofstadt to address the committee. Again, in the context of his visit, I would be happy to make arrangements or to suggest that he might visit a Border area, perhaps even in your constituency, Chairman. The same could apply if we have an opportunity with the chief negotiator, Mr. Barnier, at some stage. He has been to Dublin for formal meetings. I think it would be appropriate that all the key figures visiting Ireland would have an opportunity to see a practical demonstration of the invisible Border. This arises in the context of the peace process and the fact that since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, the North-South relationships in terms of relations among people, trade, commerce, business, education and health are such that the maintenance of that Border is of major national importance for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> This leads me to the question from Deputy Darragh O'Brien. Our priorities in these negotiations are to ensure that the seamless frictionless invisible Border continues, that nothing adverse to current arrangements will arise and that the unique circumstances derived from the Good Friday Agreement and the particular circumstances relating to North and South would be fully recognised in the context of the negotiations. We will be entering into these negotiations from an all-island perspective. It will involve impressing on our EU colleagues, as well as those from the UK, the unique circumstances that will be required in respect of the final negotiated framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> On Tuesday, I raised the matter of the timeframe for Article 50 with the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Brokenshire. He confirmed that matters are still on track having regard to the judicial aspect of things, which has been dealt with and the parliamentary debate, which has taken place. It would appear to be still very much the desire of the British Government that the Article 50 invocation will take place before the end of March.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> I wish to make a final comment on our engagement with the EU. I acknowledge the Chairman's welcome suggestion. St. Patrick's Day represents another opportunity where Ministers travelling abroad will be involved in engagements. One of the aspects of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations this year will be that every Minister who travels abroad will be required to have a Brexit meeting in some respect and inform persons with whom they are engaging of the importance of Ireland's position within the European Union and that, irrespective of the vote of the British people, Ireland will not be leaving the European Union but that the unique and special circumstances on the island of Ireland needs to be fully recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> The Taoiseach has met a number of his EU prime-ministerial colleagues and I have met all of mine. St. Patrick's Day presents further opportunities. I would be very happy to keep Deputy Darragh O'Brien and other members informed. At this stage I have clocked up in excess of 100 bilateral meetings on the matter of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. The central co-ordinating point is in the Department of the Taoiseach in respect of that analysis and the impact assessment across a range of Departments. The Brexit Cabinet committee is meeting again this evening. I again make clear the intent on the part of the Government that the chairmen of these committees and Opposition spokespersons and party leaders be fully informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> In response to Deputy McLoughlin, it is important that as public representatives, we all avail of the opportunity of listening to people and engaging with stakeholders in the manner in which he suggested. He mentioned agriculture and haulage. This week I attended a meeting in Galway attended by 250 people, all of whom have anxieties and concerns. I know all the political parties are engaged, as is this committee. There is a duty and burden on every one of us, as public representatives, to engage with our citizens and stakeholders in order that we are fully apprised of the issues to help us in the negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> We have done a huge amount of preparation. We are ready for these negotiations. We go into them in a very positive frame of mind and with a positive disposition. The Irish people faced very serious challenges in the past. We have a very experienced team in Brussels. We have spoken to Mr. Barnier on a range of issues - I met him as recently as last week. He is in no doubt as to the unique and special circumstances relating to the island of Ireland, our peace process and our trade links. We go into these negotiations very much prepared but not in any way underestimating what is a serious and difficult challenge.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I appreciate that the Minister has kept us informed of the meetings happening within the Department. Speaking from an Opposition perspective, I say that we need more briefings from officials to other parties and groupings in the Dáil. I am not just talking about the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but of all relevant Departments. That aspect needs to be strengthened, in particular coming into March and April.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> My party is linked to the ALDE group in Europe, which has seven Prime Ministers or EU member states. We meet regularly and will travel to a meeting at the start of March. Most parties and groupings want to help in this. Some very small parties welcomed the Brexit result as a workers' revolution, which was total nonsense, but this is a major threat. Other parties and groupings are willing to help and are helping. It is important that we have a consistent message as a country and the way to get it across is through more regular official briefings outside of normal committees such as this one. That is just a point; it is not a criticism.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">I absolutely agree with the Chairman. It is not just the responsibility of the Government. We all have a role, including Members and officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> We all know the unique relationship between Ireland and Britain. I take it from the responses that Ireland will not seek special status for the North of Ireland in a European context. We are effectively saying that the British Government has rejected the notion of special status, be that membership of the EEA, associate membership or something like that. Are we now also rejecting that? I want clarification on that aspect.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">These negotiations have not even started yet. Our priorities are fully recognised as the negotiations commence. One of those priorities is protecting the Northern Ireland peace process. In talking about special status within the European Union, there are certain difficulties regarding the maintenance of Northern Ireland within the European Union, having regard to the Good Friday Agreement and having regard to the fact that it is the United Kingdom that is the member of the European Union. That said there are unique and special circumstances pertaining to the island of Ireland. We need to ensure that is fully factored into the negotiations. We need to maintain the common travel area, east-west as well as North-South.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> On the particular point the Deputy raises regarding the need to impress upon our EU colleagues in the negotiations, while the people in Northern Ireland actually voted to remain within the European Union, any special status for Northern Ireland within the European Union is something that to my mind is unachievable for a number of reasons, not least of which is that the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and her entire Cabinet have said on a number of occasions that they intend withdrawing the UK from the European Union.</p>

          <p eId="para_125"> I understand what the Minister is saying, which is that because it would be difficult to achieve, we are not going to try. The largest number of EU citizens who will be outside the European Union will reside in the Six Counties, in the North of Ireland, post Brexit. It is totally unique. The EU will understand that it is unique. There are difficulties with Spain and other countries. Are we watching what will happen with Gibraltar, Catalonia, etc.?</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> I believe the special status idea should be put to the EU and discussed. If it wants to reject it, it can reject it. The British are saying they will not have it; that is fine. In the main the people in the North want it and, as the Minister knows, 56% voted to remain. The largest proportion of EU citizens living outside the EU post Brexit will be in the North of Ireland. Such a special and unique case deserves special status. I understand negotiations have not started. We will come back to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">This compares with €60.4 million in 2016 and represents a reduction of €4.6 million on the Revised 2016 Estimates, which were increased last November, as committee members will recall, by way of a technical Supplementary Estimate to cover additional contributions to the UN, in particular relating to peacekeeping, and to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, to meet Ireland's full obligations in 2016 to these organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> Much of the expenditure under this programme relates to Ireland’s mandatory contributions to international organisations of which we are a member, including the United Nations. The 2017 Estimates reflect the best estimate, at this time, of mandatory contributions due in 2017. It should be noted, however, as we saw last year, that the challenge in forecasting the UN peacekeeping budget in particular, which is the largest part of our payments to the UN, is never an easy one. It is difficult to estimate this in advance as existing peacekeeping operations may be expanded, reduced or further developed, depending on the circumstances, or a new one might be established. In addition, UN contributions are invoiced in US dollars and therefore are subject to currency fluctuations.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> Ireland is seeking election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021 to 2022 term, a candidacy we declared in 2005. We will base our campaign on Ireland's foreign policy credentials and strong international standing at the UN. We continue to engage closely with the UN and other multilateral partners, such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe, which is very important to us. We make contributions to the work of our multilateral partners in targeted policy areas, including peacekeeping, conflict resolution and conflict prevention, international development, disarmament and UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security. We will continue our efforts to make the UN and other multilateral institutions more effective in facing global, regional and development challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> Disarmament and non-proliferation issues will remain a priority in 2017, building on our active engagement and participation in the international disarmament and non-proliferation process. Ireland will play an active role in negotiations at a forthcoming UN-mandated diplomatic conference to negotiate a new legal instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading to their total elimination. These negotiations will begin in New York next month.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> We continue to advance human rights priorities, building on our successful membership and solid record of achievements at the UN Human Rights Council following our two-year term on the council which ended in 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> A key pillar of our international engagement under programme C is our input into the shaping and formulation of the European Union's common foreign and security policy, CFSP, most notably at the monthly meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council in which I participate and to which I made reference earlier in my reply to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> There is no denying this is a time of great concern and some frustration for the Middle East peace process. The process has somewhat stalled. We will continue to argue for strengthened international focus and more intensive international action, in the first instance through our membership of the EU. This is what I have been doing at the Foreign Affairs Council, most recently at the meetings in January and February. I was pleased to participate as an invitee to an international Middle East peace process conference in Paris in January.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I have a particular interest in the Middle East and I hope the committee will have an opportunity to visit, as I have, the refugee camps in northern Lebanon to see the hundreds of thousands of Christians who have been displaced from Syria. The two major superpowers are squaring up to each other in the Middle East, and whatever will happen now with the election of Trump? Peace in the Middle East must come from within the Middle East. What contact has been made at EU level with the Iranian Government? Iran has a population of 180 million and has a major role to play in bringing peace and stability to the Middle East. I do not believe the two superpowers will achieve it. Has any contact been made at EU level or by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with Iran? The Minister touched on it, and I tabled a parliamentary question recently, on whether the Minister had any proposals to open an embassy in Iran. It is a country with which we should start to foster relations, particularly now sanctions have been lifted, although it is difficult to know what Trump will do. It has a major role to play in bringing peace and stability to the Middle East, which must come from within the Middle East. What contact does the Department have with Middle Eastern governments to ascertain whether a resolution can be proposed? Are there proposals at EU level to try to bring peace there? Many of the people in the refugee camps do not want to come to Ireland or go to the United States. The vast majority of them just want to go home, where they were born and reared, and not become a refugee in another country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_140">I thank the Minister for outlining the issues. I support the ongoing work of our Defence Forces in peacekeeping throughout the world. They are a credit to the country and we are all very proud of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> With regard to the human rights element to which the Minister alluded, what is Ireland's view on the proposed third country arrangements between the EU and Libya? I have been critical of the arrangement with Turkey but the idea of sending refugees back to Libya is absolutely crazy. With regard to Afghanistan, an EU memo on the forced resettlement of people back to that country was leaked. In my view this would be in breach of the Geneva Convention and I note 16 other third country arrangements are in preparation. The Minister has said previously, in response to questions from me in the Dáil, that in broad terms the Government supports these arrangements, which I consider to be a mistake. What is Ireland's view on this proposed arrangement and future arrangements?</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> I am very interested to hear about our ongoing effort to win a seat on the UN Security Council. Deputy Grealish and I met the Secretary General of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, at the beginning of January, and many Arab countries are very well disposed towards us. Peacekeeping was mentioned specifically by the Secretary General in an extensive meeting, which was also attended by the Ceann Comhairle and members of the Minister's party. It is interesting there is goodwill towards us. Will the Minister tell us how it is going at present?</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> The Minister knows my views on the Middle East peace process. Has the Department relayed officially the absolute displeasure and concern of the Irish Government and the Dáil at the heightened measure of building on Palestinian lands? In recent weeks 6,000 additional homes were announced. A vote in the Knesset, which will be taken to court in Israel, would retrospectively legalise illegal settlements in the Palestinian occupied territories. I firmly believe, and I know it is in the programme for Government and has been included in the programmes of successive Governments, that a two-state solution is absolutely the way forward. Most of us agree with this. My concern is there will be nothing left to recognise if this is allowed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> We also had the discussions yesterday between President Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, from which the indications were that for the US Administration, the two-state solution effectively is not that important and everything relates to Israel. In no way, shape or form have I ever tried to antagonise or am antagonising the Israelis. I fully respect Israel and we have full diplomatic ties with Israel but it is about time Ireland got off the fence and moved to officially recognise the state of Palestine as part of a two-state solution. It is in the programme for Government. The Dáil and Seanad passed a motion in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">I, and most of my Opposition colleagues, tabled a motion last June that was based on the 2014 motion with which the Minister's party agreed. I would like to get an update on that. I do not want the House to divide on such an issue. It is about time this country made a stand and said that what is occurring in the Palestinian territories is simply wrong. There is no other way of putting it.</p>

          <p eId="para_146">I thank Deputy Darragh O'Brien. Before the Minister responds, when we contribute to international organisations do we have any input into the programmes our funding goes towards or do we get a report of the outturn for the year for each organisation as to where the money went?</p>

          <p eId="para_147">The answer to that is "Yes". Our influence as a small state has been well recognised. It is not a new-found influence; it recognises the steadfast support of the international organisations by the Irish people and by successive Governments over many years. We make our priorities known in many ways for many of the programmes. The Irish influence is evident. Yes, the organisations produce annual reports with reference to the programmes and I am sure the reports can be made available to the committee at any time.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Deputy Grealish spoke about relations with Iran. To add to what I said earlier, our representative in Ankara has current responsibility for our engagement with Iran and we also have an active honorary consul in Tehran. We keep under review the matter of a more positive presence or level of engagement. Having regard to the changed circumstances in Iran, there is a desire now, not only on Ireland's part but on the part of the European Union and the international community to work towards improved relations with Iran. Last year's visit by EU High Representative Mogherini to Tehran was important. We continue at EU level to ensure that we look at a greater level of opportunity in terms of trade, technical co-operation and a level of political dialogue which recognises both Iran's role and its influence in the region. I met the Speaker of the Iranian Parliament here last year and other Members, perhaps even members of this committee, have engaged on a bilateral basis. I must acknowledge there are difficulties in the area of human rights and with regard to Iran's involvement in and association with a number of conflicts and tension points in the region, which must also be borne in mind. I will be happy to keep the committee informed. It is my belief that we should continue along the path of dialogue to ensure that we can have an improved relationship across a range of pursuits. I am a great believer in dialogue across a range of issues. That also plugs into the St. Patrick's Day event. People should avail of opportunities to speak at all levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> In response to Deputy O'Brien's contribution on the Middle East peace process, I visited the region twice, officially, in recent years. I have discussed the Middle East peace process with both local leaders, EU colleagues, senior persons at the highest level in the Palestinian Administration and directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu last year in Jerusalem, along with former defence Minister and current Minister Lieberman and others. I acknowledge what the programme for Government states and the commitment on the part of the Government to ensure the viability of a two-state solution in an area of great challenge, which has been the case for many years. I am committed to continuing to acknowledge the importance of the two-state solution. I keep under continuous review whether an immediate recognition by Ireland of a state of Palestine, prior to its real achievement on the ground, is helpful towards the goal of finding a lasting resolution to this conflict. It is not a matter of making up my mind. It is not a matter of me being unwilling. Neither is it a matter of the Government being unwilling but it is a matter of ensuring that we make what will be a lasting contribution. Deputy Darragh O'Brien calls on me to condemn the settlement expansion in a way that perhaps he feels I have not been doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">No, to clarify, I do not make such a charge against the Minister. I asked whether since the recent announcements of the expanded settlements we had been formally in contact with the Israelis but I do not lay a charge at the Minister's door that he has not spoken out in the past.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">My view on the continued unacceptable expansion and further development of settlements by the Israelis is quite clear. I acknowledge UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which states clearly that the settlements are illegal and that they actively undermine the prospects for a sustainable negotiated two-state solution. I have said that on numerous occasions and I have conveyed the message to the Israelis. In fact, the most recent announcements proposing more than 3,000 units are deeply disappointing because to my mind those actions and ongoing activities serve only to undermine the reputation of Israel and the credibility of declarations on the part of its Government towards support for a negotiated peaceful solution. I call again at this committee this morning for an end to all settlement construction and a reversal of current announcements. Yes, I have made my position and that of the Government perfectly clear, directly to the Israelis. I want the Government's position to form a very positive part of moving towards a solution. I was very pleased to represent the Government at two internationally convened peace conferences in Paris last year and again in January of this year. It is important that international engagement is also acknowledged in the context of any unilateral action that may be considered on the part of this country. This is a matter to which we will have an opportunity of returning both on Question Time and in the broader plenary sessions of the Dáil agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Deputy Darragh O'Brien mentioned his meeting with the Secretary General of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit. I acknowledge the importance of that meeting. That influential figure is a friend of Ireland and there is an element of goodwill there in terms of our relationship, which is important for us in respect of our UN Security Council campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">That campaign is under way. It will be a difficult challenge, as indeed all campaigns are. I wish to assure the House of a very active, positive and constructive engagement on the part of Ireland. Ireland, Norway and Canada are in a campaign for two positions and both myself and my Government colleagues are taking every opportunity we have to engage with our international colleagues. </p>
          <p eId="para_154"> I wish to acknowledge the positive contribution of Deputy O'Brien when speaking to the secretary general of the Arab League. Any influence that can be brought to bear by this committee in terms of parliamentary engagement is always positive and I would ask the committee to continue in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, is anxious to speak on the matter of Vote 27. We might like to be brief in order to facilitate that. The Department's work under programme D, which was previously programme C, will focus on leveraging our resources to drive job creation, our exports including cultural exports, inward investment, tourism and education. There will be a particular focus in 2017 on assisting Irish business in the context of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> My Department’s commitment to advancing Ireland’s trade and economic interests in Europe and internationally is set out. The current amount allocated is €31.2 million, representing an increase of €3 million on 2016, mainly due to the consolidation of existing promotion and outreach funding from a range of programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> We play a crucial role in efforts to restore our international reputation and to promote Ireland’s economic interests overseas. Our economy is in good shape and continuing to grow strongly. Key indicators on employment, GDP and debt levels continue to move steadily in a positive direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Members will be familiar with the work of our embassies abroad through trade missions and visits. The networking they do and their engagement with the local community at all levels, as members of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, is an essential platform for our bilateral relations and for the work of the State agencies. I wish to acknowledge the work of this committee in that regard. It is helpful to me in my work and is also helpful to the Government. The work projects, in terms of Irish values, expand our influence, secure our place in Europe, support our people abroad, and foster our continued prosperity. These remain our high level goals. I believe it is important that we engage at the highest level. </p>
          <p eId="para_160"> We look at our pre-existing market funds in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, designed to support larger initiatives and projects and spanning a number of countries and of course, in the context of Brexit, the need to ensure a greater level of market diversification and intensification. That is a core focus for team Ireland overseas. Our export trade council meets regularly, we have expanded further now in the context of the challenge of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. We also have the full and active participation of the Minister for Education and Skills and his officials with particular reference to international education and the drive to capture a greater share of that market. </p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Our trade division funds a range of activities associated with joint economic commissions with four countries: China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. It also supports the cultural and economic work of missions through the development of materials, exhibitions and funding for translation. All engage in a comprehensive and ever challenging programme of international activity. I want to acknowledge its important role and function. </p>
          <p eId="para_162"> In conclusion, it is my belief that the reconfiguration of the Department of Foreign Affairs in 2011 with the inclusion of the trade promotion label has been extremely important and will continue to play a very important role in the context of our engagement internationally. The Department of Foreign Affairs is now firmly the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is a primary focus of our international engagement.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">I fully agree with the Minister on the trade promotion element and that trade is now firmly embedded within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is important. It is logical and it makes sense. To follow on from what the Chairman has said, I would like to ask the Minister about the new trade strategy. When it is published, what will the process be? Will the Minister be bringing it to this Committee? That might be useful for us to look at because it is certainly a crucial part of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> In the context of St. Patrick's Day, we all understand the importance of that. I see that there are metrics now, which the Minister has designed within his Department, of the number of visits, trade missions and that type of thing. They are very interesting to track but there seemed to be a drop between 2015 and 2016 on Minister-led trade missions supported by State agencies and the embassy network. If I am reading it correctly, there were 34 in 2015, which dropped to 18 in 2016. The Minister has targeted 24 of these Minister-led missions in 2017. Perhaps I am reading it wrong but it is good to be able to track it like that. Will the Minister elaborate on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_185">I thank the Chairman. The focus of programme E will be on strengthening our corporate performance with a view towards an improved level of public service. This will include enhanced corporate governance, increased public diplomacy, strong commitment to transparency, customer satisfaction engagement and reviewing and upgrading key corporate processes and procedures. The allocation is €39.3 million compared with €41 million in 2016. In addition to these areas of focus mentioned, my Department will also work to enhance services through the medium of Irish. Indeed customer service, and I mentioned this in the context of the passport, is at the heart of our work.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> I referred earlier to the passport issue. Again I would be happy to keep the committee fully informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Public communications in providing travel advice and consular information have been transformed. The consular services division is faced with requests from increasing numbers of people, many of whom find themselves in great difficulty and require immediate attention. I acknowledge the great professionalism of the consular services. Their work is often done out of office hours and at weekends in dealing with difficult emergencies. There is a particular focus on the ongoing operation of the Department's web and social media presence. I urge committee members, in their engagements with constituents, to highlight how the Department's website is a mine of helpful travel information. There is also the new smartphone app, TravelWise, which was launched last year and is a must for anyone who is travelling, particularly young people travelling to the United States under the new recently announced J1 visa scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> Programme F deals with income accruing in appropriations-in-aid. Total income in appropriations-in-aid in 2017 is estimated at over €45 million. Passport, citizenship, visa and other consular fees are set by way of a statutory instrument issued under section 3 of the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Provision of Services) Act 1993.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">I thank the Minister. Many of us have had interaction with the consular services over the years, often when a family in our constituency are facing difficulties with a family member who may be ill or has died abroad. Some months ago the committee heard from Mr. Colin Bell of the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust which is involved in bringing back the remains of deceased Irish citizens from Australia, New Zealand, the United States and elsewhere. The consular services provide a wonderful service in helping people when there are sudden deaths of family members abroad. Unfortunately, all members have had to engage with the services for constituents over the years. They, too, appreciate the support of the consular network across the world.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I acknowledge the tremendous work done by the consular services abroad. Unfortunately, when there is an accident abroad, the first port of call is the local Deputy who will then ring the embassy or consulate. A telephone call from an embassy or a consulate to a family affected gives them comfort that there is somebody who can handle the situation. Will the Minister, please, pass on to consular services staff our appreciation of the tremendous work they do?</p>

There are exceptional people working in the consular services who are a credit to the country, particularly when one sees them working on the ground. It has been consistently recognised, but this year will be more challenging for many of our embassies, particularly in Europe. There is never a problem with the consular services and the staff are a credit to the Civil Service and the State.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_194">I welcome the opportunity to present the 2017 Revised Estimate for Vote 27, international co-operation, as well as to briefly outline our plans for the current year. Last May I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development and I have greatly valued the work and advice of this committee in the period since.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Vote 27 funds about 80% of Ireland's official development assistance, ODA, programme, better known to the public as Irish Aid. The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department's high level goal to work towards a fairer, more just, secure and sustainable world. This year the Government has provided €651 million in official development assistance, an increase of €10 million on last year's allocation. The increase builds on the momentum started in 2016 in increasing budget allocations for official development assistance in a measured and sustainable way. It also represents a clear demonstration of the Government's firm commitment to the aid programme. In the past year we have consistently reaffirmed our commitment to making progress towards achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, as official development assistance. The programme for Government makes our position clear that we will make progress towards the target as resources permit. As economic recovery consolidates, we have begun to increase ODA allocations and hope to continue to deliver on this commitment into the future. Our ambition is to continue to make sustainable progress towards the UN target in line with the commitment we have made with our fellow EU member states to collectively reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2030. I recognise the challenge the target presents and look forward to engaging with the committee on our common commitment to achieving it.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> Over 80% of Irish Aid's funding is provided in sub-Saharan Africa where needs are greatest. The priority we attach to Africa is also a wider European one, given the increasing connections and the common pressures facing the two continents. In July I visited Uganda and in December, Kenya. I saw how Ireland's aid programme was sharply focused on helping vulnerable people in the poorest regions from Karamoja to Adjumani in northern Uganda to Samburu County in northern Kenya. I also had the privilege of visiting several inspiring projects run by Irish missionary organisations in Kenya, as well as meeting Irish missionaries who have made such a remarkable contribution to Africa and developing an empathy with it among the Irish people. I also saw how our embassies integrated their work across all areas, from building trade to political, cultural and people-to-people links between Ireland and Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> The committee will be aware of the daunting, unprecedented scale of humanitarian need globally. Over 128 million people in 33 countries around the world are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, with 65 million displaced from their homes. The United Nations requires $22.2 billion in 2017 to reach the most vulnerable, five times the amount required a decade ago. The humanitarian crises we face are the result of natural disaster, climate change, drought, wars and conflict. The conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen will remain among the greatest drivers of prolonged humanitarian needs in 2017. I will travel to Lebanon and Jordan in the coming weeks to assess the impact and the humanitarian response. The officials in the Department will be more than happy to facilitate a visit by the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">Yes; that is why we are going there. Since 2012 Ireland has provided over €67 million in response to the Syrian crisis, including €25 million last year alone. We are monitoring closely the difficult situation across the Horn of Africa and responding. I am particularly concerned about near-famine conditions in several countries, including Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria. I am determined that we will continue to provide support for the so-called "forgotten" crises in places such as Darfur, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic which often do not receive attention in the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Development co-operation is at the heart of Ireland's foreign policy. Our key objective in 2017 is to continue delivering a world class programme, aimed at some of the world's most vulnerable and marginalised peoples and helping to save lives and build livelihoods.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> I would welcome comments and questions from committee members.</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T11:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_202">I thank the Minister of State. We are all conscious of the significant importance of this programme to so many in need of assistance affected by the many humanitarian crises across the world. Only yesterday the committee met the Red Cross representative from Mali. It is one of the worst countries on the poverty index, with a serious lack of access for its people to proper sanitation and education services.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">It is a country we do not hear or read about now, which emphasises the scale of humanitarian crises there are throughout the world. My understanding is that spend on overseas development aid this year will be 0.3% of GNP, which is the lowest spend in this area for 17 years. We all know that the Government and every Department is facing huge challenges, but as a country we need to progress our achievement of the 0.7% goal to which we have been committed for some time. The sustainable development goals, in which Ireland, through the Minister of State, and his colleague, Mr. David Donoghue, played a huge part in achieving, are dependent on countries increasing their commitment to overseas development aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> In regard to Brexit, will the EU development budget be impacted by Britain leaving the EU? We all have difficulties with Britain on many issues, but under successive Governments over the past decade or so it has managed to ramp up its contribution to overseas development aid. Whatever its contribution directly to the EU budget, there will be a loss following Brexit. We all complain, and rightly so, about the EU and its structures and governance, but it is the main donor in terms of overseas development aid in response to humanitarian crises. It is important to recognise that. At a time when there are, unfortunately, more crises and humanitarian need throughout the world, as a country Ireland needs to do better. The Minister of State will probably respond to the effect that there has been a change in the measurement of our GNP. Whether or not that is true I do not know, but we should be improving incrementally towards achieving the 0.7% of GNP.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">Following on from the Chairman's point in regard to current spend being 0.3% of GNP, perhaps the Minister of State would confirm if that is the official outturn figure for last year.</p>

        <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_207">Okay. Does the Minister of State have the final figure for 2016? There has been only a €10 million increase, although I acknowledge that, in fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, he will be fighting for additional provision. I recognise the work of Irish Aid, Mr. Gaffey and his team. It is superb, there is no question about that, but it needs to be further resourced. During our first meeting last year I raised the issue of multiannual planning, which I accept will require the agreement of all parties and groups. I am aware of the difficulties which the Minister of State will face in terms of going to Government and asking for a significant increase for overseas development aid at a time when other Ministers are seeking funds for other projects, but while the current provision is significant, we are going backwards. There is no point in restating a goal that we are never going to achieve. In a previous report to the committee by, I think, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, we were told that we were expected to achieve the 0.7% target by 2030. Is that the official Government line now? We need to give serious consideration to what is achievable over a five-year timeframe and to put that money in place. The Minister of State needs to put that up to other parties, including Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> Following on from the spring statement, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight is the starting point for the budgetary process. A €10 million per annum increase is not enough. If we continue with that, we will end up sliding backwards such that we might as well forget about ever achieving the 0.7% target. I am not laying responsibility for this at the door of the Minister of State because it is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister of State and the Government. It is about time all parties and groups were asked what they propose to do in monetary terms. I proposed that last year. Fianna Fáil is open to working with Government in this regard and we want other parties and groups to do likewise. The tough choice will have to be made. We need to see a significant increase in this budget. I recognise the work of Dóchas and other NGOs in this sector in working with Irish Aid. Fianna Fáil has done work on this issue. We estimate that to get to 0.4% over a four-year period, a €60 million to €70 million allocation will be required next year, but that is unlikely to happen. We need either to forget about the target and be realistic - which I do not want us to do - or take serious steps to achieve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> The work being done with our partner countries is great. Is consideration being given to our partnering with other countries' aid programmes? I a believer in untied aid. The British model is slightly different from that. Some countries will use aid for trade. I do not think we should do that but we can use Irish Aid to partner with countries that, perhaps, diplomatically we have work to do but with which we do not have the necessary business ties. There are countries that do a lot of work in Africa, including Israel. The Minister of State might be surprised to hear me mention that but I genuinely believe Irish Aid is a really good vehicle through which we can improve our relations with other countries or get to know other countries better. Is any such work under consideration? I again commend the work that Irish Aid is doing. I would like to see us support it more and to see us make greater progress in achieving the 0.7% target. That is not happening.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelGrealishPD" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2017-02-16T11:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_210">I thank the Minister of State for his presentation. Were any organisations or projects suspended owing to fraud or because they were not being run properly? Are there projects or agencies under the remit of the Department under investigation in terms of the manner in which funding was spent? How does the Department police the spend of funding on projects? How does it ensure money is spent in the areas for which it is provided?</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> I acknowledge the Minister of State's comments in regard to the Irish missionaries abroad. I recall speaking at a function a few years ago in Lusaka at which there were a number of missionaries in attendance. As I said on that occasion, the missionaries are the true ambassadors for Ireland abroad. They are the people who make the Irish feel welcome and wanted. When I visited the Parliament in Lusaka, I met 14 members of Parliament who were taught by Irish missionaries, which is phenomenal. It is because of the work of the Irish missionaries down through the years that Ireland is held in such high esteem abroad and St. Patrick's Day is celebrated in so many countries around the world. We are, unfortunately, running out of missionaries to send abroad. However, as I said, those we have are doing tremendous work on the ground. I once met a nun who was 74 years old and had left Donegal at 17 years of age. Her order wanted to bring her home to retire but she did not want to come home. She said that she had lived all of her life in Lusaka and she did not want to go back to wet and windy Ireland. Perhaps the order should take that on board and should stop forcing people home to come home and spend the remainder of their lives in Ireland where all too often the weather is miserable.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">The only way we can work towards achieving the 0.7% target is collectively. I am on record already in that regard. In regard to the sustainable development goals and the 2030 plan I do not think it is good enough to say that in 14 years we will achieve the 0.7% target. If we want to hit that target we need to put in place a mechanism to do so and the only way we can do that is working collectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Since 2011 to date, the total development package which Irish taxpayers have contributed is €4.5 billion. When I indicate that at various events, people are surprised to hear it. It is reflective of where people are at in terms of what they want to do and their contribution to the global challenges. In a survey undertaken by the UN before Christmas, Ireland was ranked ninth in the world in terms of <i>per capita</i> contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">In fact, we are ahead of the United States because, while the United States signs the biggest cheque for development globally, we are ahead of them <i>per capita</i>. I do not, however, accept that we should be at 0.3%. We could do more but we have come through an economic period which left us faced with certain choices. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, very harsh measures were taken on respite care, people with disabilities etc. but the ODA budget stayed the same. The Irish taxpayers need to be acknowledged for that. I am happy to work with the committee on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> Deputy O'Brien asked where we were in terms of opportunities to partner with other countries. We are in consultation with fellow EU members and are looking for joined-up programming opportunities and these will happen. I acknowledge the work that David Donoghue and his team have done. They have built up their reputation for work in Kenya and Jordan over decades. Missionary work down the years also allows us to open doors. I met missionaries to Africa in Limerick at the beginning of the year and they used the word "authenticity". We have authenticity in our reputation at the moment. The Department of Finance in Kampala in Uganda asked us to get more involved in business. Many of them were educated by Irish priests and nuns and they see our honesty and integrity. It is not about using that as a platform and as an opportunity for business but it is about business connections helping in a wider sense in areas such as sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> I had a wonderful opportunity to meet Sr. Mary Owens in Nairobi, Kenya. She started off as a principal in my alma mater in Milford in 1966 and was three years there before going to Africa, where she has been since. She is working with young children and teenagers on a HIV programme. A laboratory has been built with financing from Irish Aid. It is a wonderful project and such investments in humanity by Irish people should never be forgotten. They have ploughed the furrow for the rest of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> A question was also asked on evaluation auditing and the money that goes to different groups. We have a very strict and accountable system for funds, which amounted to €651 million this year. There is a very good system of governance which is evolving all the time to adapt to different challenges. It is a requirement of all grant agreements that partners in receipt of Irish Aid funding, with the exception of international organisations, provide annual audited accounts. Audit coverage is close to 100%, though there may be exemptions for very small grants. The number of partners and grants, both at headquarters and in partner countries, will vary each year, as will the number of audit reports received annually. A reasonable estimate would be more than 200 reports each year. Audit requirements for international organisations, such as UN bodies, are laid down in international agreements. The Department usually receives audited financial statements from these bodies. In addition, with regard to UN bodies, the Department receives reports on internal audit activity presented to the executive boards.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">I concur with the comments of Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Noel Grealish on the contribution of Irish religious and lay missionaries. Over the years the different Irish NGOs have made presentations to us and the people at the coalface are working in the most difficult circumstances to deliver services. We owe them a great debt of gratitude for the work they do, helping the most deprived people in the world. We will never give enough in ODA and Deputy O'Brien's suggestion for an all-party approach at budgetary level could help the Minister for Foreign Affairs to get a better allocation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Whether in good times or bad times, there are always pressures on the budget for every Department and maybe an all-party approach, through the Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight, would be a good way to get unanimous agreement. We need to do more for the most deprived people and that does not take away from the huge challenges facing many people in our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Deputy Grealish has often spoken of the huge contribution of our missionaries over the years. The Holy Rosary Sisters are neighbours of mine in Cavan town. They are all retired people who have come back from Africa, nuns who gave their lives to teaching, nursing and working as doctors and consultants. They are amazing people and they did outstanding missionary work in areas where there were no services and no facilities. The good work they did helps us today to sell Irish products or win support for a seat on the UN Security Council or the human rights council.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> I am glad the Minister met some of our missionaries and representatives of NGOs. Following a proposal of Deputy O'Brien, we have made a decision to undertake a review of Irish Aid, to bring in NGOs, the Minister of State and his officials to do a short report which we can present to Dáil Éireann. According to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, it is some time since there was a full debate on ODA in the Dáil. We want to rectify this and if we produce a report and bring it to the Dáil for a full debate, we can advance Deputy O'Brien's idea. If members or the Minister have any other suggestions for refining that work, we would be glad to hear them.</p>
