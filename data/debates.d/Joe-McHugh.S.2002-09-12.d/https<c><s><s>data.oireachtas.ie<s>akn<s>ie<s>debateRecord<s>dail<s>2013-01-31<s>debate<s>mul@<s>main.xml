          <from>Deputy Willie O'Dea<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">Yesterday a Redemptorist priest, Fr. Michael Cusack, had some things to say about the Government's policy on rural policing. He "urged fresh thinking on policing resources so that people in rural communities do not sleep in their beds in fear, and evil does not triumph over virtue." He went on to describe how, after a garda had been removed from his local parish in County Galway, a particularly horrific crime occurred. Is the Minister aware that Fr. Cusack is merely reflecting concerns expressed by the Opposition for many months and, more important, the Garda Síochána, elected members of political parties, not least the main Government party, independent commentators who have written on and spoken about the subject, Muintir na Tíre, the IFA, rural communities, community leaders and every group which represents anyone in rural Ireland? Is the Minister further aware that there are more reports today of a businessman in County Galway who has been robbed four times in the past six months and a woman in County Kildare who has been robbed twice in recent months by people who travelled from the city by bus to commit the robberies? Is the Government going to ignore and dismiss all the concerns of communities throughout the country by proceeding to allow 95 rural Garda stations to close as and from today?</p>

          <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_2">I listened carefully to what Fr. Cusack had to say yesterday in the Redemptorist Church in Dundalk. He spoke very movingly about the trauma experienced by anyone, whether they lived in a rural area or a city centre, who had ever been subjected to a robbery or an invasion of his or her home space, particularly robbery with violence. Fr. Cusack spoke movingly about that experience. In the latter part of his comments Deputy Willie O'Dea addressed what was happening in terms of the changes in crime patterns because of the development of the road network.</p>

          <p eId="para_4">The Deputy brought it up. Everyone on all sides of the House is aware that it is possible for individuals or groups involved in crime to move rapidly from one part of the country to another. For this reason, the Garda has undertaken a special operation to target those involved in such crimes which, I suggest to the Deputy, not only affect the rural areas about which he speaks but all suburban areas in towns and cities also. This is one of the changes in how criminals operate. I note the significant success of the Garda operation, Operation Fiacla, as a consequence of which between April and December 2012 a total of 3,538 people were arrested and 1,925 people were charged. As part of this debate there is a real issue in terms of how our police force operates. Yesterday we saw at the funeral of Detective Garda Donohoe a magnificent and moving demonstration of how the community, the country and the State stand by gardaí as gardaí have stood by their country. Operation Fiacla probably represents one of the best developments in Garda management and the fight against crime. It shows, in terms of results and the number of arrests, the numbers being brought before the courts and the decline in the number of burglaries.</p>

          <p eId="para_6">In terms of the debate in the House, Fianna Fáil should consider how best we should police all parts of society, with the objective of bringing criminals before the courts and putting those found guilty behind bars. That is what modern, effective policing is about.</p>

          <p eId="para_7">I asked the Minister a simple direct question and she answered everything but the question I asked. She quoted various data. The number of burglaries is up by 10%, but I suppose if one tortures data sufficiently, one can get them to confess to anything. That is the bottom line. I am amazed to hear the development of the road network is now responsible for much rural crime. I am putting a direct question to the Minister. Does she consider a society in which people, old people in particular and persons living in isolated rural areas, go to bed at night in fear represents the vision for change the people voted for only two years ago? As I want to be clear, I am asking the Minister a direct question. Will she confirm to the House and, through it, the country that in spite of all the anxiety, fear, terror and protests from thousands of people who have turned out to protest at the closures throughout the country, the Government's answer is, "No change; we are going to proceed regardless"? A simple "Yes" or "No" would suffice.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">Everyone in the House serving different parts of the country is aware that criminal methods have changed. People use vans and other forms of transport. The response of the Garda, in particular Garda management, has been to develop targeted policing methods to actually deal with the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">Deputy Willie O'Dea may scoff but the fact is that anybody, whether living in an urban or rural area, will suffer if his or her home is invaded by someone bent on robbery. That is what Fr. Michael Cusack was talking about yesterday. I was in the church listening extremely carefully. He referred to the enormous trauma suffered by victims of robbery. He told the stories of two victims of violent robbery in particular.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">There is no doubt that the closure of almost 100 Garda stations today represents a serious blow to rural Ireland in particular but also to some urban communities. These are the very communities which have already suffered under the cuts regime of this and the previous Government. We have seen in recent weeks and months a spate of burglaries targeting vulnerable and elderly people. For many communities, the local Garda station provides peace of mind and allows people to sleep soundly in their beds. The Government has decided, however, to continue with the implementation of Fianna Fáil's so-called national recovery plan from 2010 by making further Garda cuts.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">The difficulty is that very many people who rely on Operation Fiacla believe it is gan fiacla because the gardaí are not sufficiently resourced. The Minister knows this because she represents an urban constituency not a million miles away from my own. She knows that the most common and sometimes the only complaint citizens have regarding the gardaí is the lengthy response time. They call the Garda but they are not in a position to respond promptly. It is the biggest frustration one comes across. That is in an urban setting. Let us transport ourselves to rural Ireland where we know there has been a spate of very high-profile and vicious attacks, particularly on elderly people. People living in remote areas are quite correctly ill at ease because they do not believe the service they require will get to them quickly enough to keep them safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> Will the Minister at least acknowledge that the closure of almost 100 stations is a matter of grave public concern? Could she go beyond the generalised rhetoric she has offered and be far more specific about what the compensatory measures for those communities will be? Will there be additional gardaí? I support civilianisation as I believe it is the right thing to do. Will that be accelerated? How many gardaí will be freed up? Will the people in rural Ireland who are losing their stations at least know that there will be a Garda on the beat?</p>

          <p eId="para_74">The Commissioner has addressed those issues. I will return to the issue of the North because comparative policing and its success in different countries and regions both in the EU and in different parts of this island is an important factor in this debate. What is important in modern policing is that gardaí are involved in front-line duties. The PSNI inherited 140 stations but by 2015, just 49 stations will remain. This is in the context of Deputy McDonald's party being in government in the North. The Deputy should ask herself why her colleagues in the North agree to have a 40% reduction in the number of police stations.

          <p eId="para_77">Studies on crime levels in different areas are very important. All the wisdom relating to modern policing both in the US and Europe is that it is critical to get police officers out on the front line and Operation Fiacla is a very good example of that. Where it has been operating around the country, it is taking into account changes in crime patterns brought about by additional mobility due in many cases to the upgrade in the roads network. That is something with which we must deal. The Garda Commissioner and management are working on a programme and plan to make for more efficient policing for the 21st century. That seems to be what Sinn Féin is supporting the PSNI to do in the North but it always seems to have a two-faced response in respect of this - one that looks North and the other that looks South. I am asking Deputy McDonald to compare and contrast what happens in both areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">My question relates directly to the Minister's Department and policies. Last year, there was an outcry from families of children with special needs about the dramatic increase in the refusal of the domiciliary care allowance, a consequent alarming increase in the number of appeals and the waiting times for those appeals, which often went up to a year. In a parliamentary question I put to the Minister last week to which I received an answer, the same shocking pattern revealed itself when it came to applications for invalidity pensions. In 2009, 39% of applications were refused. In 2011 when the Government took office, the figure jumped to 69% while the figure in 2012 was 64%. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of appeals so that in 2012, there was a 700% increase in the number of appeals through which people had to go as opposed to 2009. That has led to the appeals office being completely overrun and unable to cope. Only one quarter of the 4,356 appeals lodged in 2012 were decided. This means that thousands of people with chronic illnesses and injuries have to wait up to and over a year to have their appeals heard for invalidity pension. There is widespread anecdotal evidence of similar patterns when it comes to applications for carer's allowance and disability allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> Why are the Minister's Department and medical assessors second-guessing consultants and GPs who are testifying to the fact that people are physically or mentally unable to work? Is she deliberately denying some of the most vulnerable people - ill people with chronic illnesses - their just entitlements? Where does this leave her constant protestations that she will defend the vulnerable, including people with special needs, when there is clear evidence of a systematic pattern on the part of her Government of denying vulnerable people their rightful entitlements and forcing them into situations of anxiety, desperation and suffering as a result of cuts she is imposing but which she dresses up as reform? </p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_81">I thank the Deputy for his question. To begin with his first point about domiciliary care allowance, I answered a question about this a few days' ago, as the Deputy noted. I am happy to repeat to the House that the waiting period for domiciliary care allowance - the Deputy has the statistics in the answer to his question - has been reduced to six weeks following the reforms of the IT platform. That is a very significant development and I compliment the staff of the Department of Social Protection working in the context of significant changes introduced in the Department as a consequence of the Croke Park agreement. They have reformed the IT system. In the context of more applications for domiciliary care allowance and a change to what is called a new IT structure, the waiting period has been reduced to six weeks and the backlog has largely been addressed. I am delighted to tell the Deputy that current applications for domiciliary care allowance should now take about six weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> I previously explained to the Deputy that while the volumes, funding and the numbers being awarded domiciliary care allowance are increasing, certain applications are not complete when presented. Deputies know this in respect of different cases. The Deputy referred to people's medical experts. It is for people's family doctors and consultants if they are involved to make a case in clear medical terms and in line with the legislation as to why somebody qualifies for the allowance so that the medical assessors, who are medically qualified people working in my Department, can take account of the advice and opinion of the person's own medical advisers. </p>
          <p eId="para_83">If the information is not forthcoming at the time of application, we allow fresh evidence to be submitted and if that is not satisfactory, people have a right of appeal. The improvements in information technology brought about by the staff in my Department have resulted in a six week waiting time. The backlog of family income supplement applications has been almost totally eliminated. We have made major improvements and, in a time of unprecedented economic difficulty, protected core rates of weekly social welfare payments and are providing additional funding under all of these headings.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> Another factor affecting the number of applications is that in 2010 the then Fianna Fáil Government reduced the payment period of illness benefit from an indefinite period to two years. Deputies who deal with these cases will be aware that a consequence of this decision was an increase in the number of people coming forward because their two year period had expired and they were seeking to migrate to another payment. They also had a right, by and large, to return to jobseeker's allowance.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">The Minister had her chance. I give most credit to the families who came out on the streets last year and embarrassed the Government into acknowledging the disgraceful mistreatment of families with special needs. They forced the Minister to address the problem, but it is now being moved to another area. She has completely failed to address the fact that since the Government took office the number of refusals of invalidity pension has dramatically increased by 64%, from 39% in 2011 to 69% in 2012. Two thirds of applicants may be receiving an answer within a few weeks, but they are being refused.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I will give an example of the people who are being refused. In most cases, they had an entitlement to illness benefit. In other words, the Department accepted that they were not fit for work and paid them illness benefit. When people applied for invalidity pension after two years, they were denied it in two thirds of cases. I know of one individual who had worked for 40 years as a bin man before developing rheumatoid arthritis and problems with his heart, knee and back. He was denied, despite being completely unable to work. I can provide a litany of similar examples of individuals who are made to suffer for months as they beg and appeal for their entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> Is there not a systematic policy of first stop refusal if the Department can find any excuse whatsoever, even when medical assistance has been provided by GPs and consultants? When people appeal, they often have to pay €200 for a consultant's letter stating the Department should not have refused them in the first place. That is another cost for those who are ill and vulnerable. It is disgraceful. Stop treating people in this bureaucratic way and give them their entitlements.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">Illness benefit is certified by the applicant's own medical adviser who submits the certificate to the Department of Social Protection. The payment period of illness benefit was previously unlimited and somebody could have remained on illness benefit for an indefinite period provided he or she was certified under the medical system, with which most Members are familiar. That system was changed in 2010. This has resulted in a large increase in the numbers applying for payments under other medical related schemes. I am delighted Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett has conceded that the civil servants in the Department have worked hard to improve the system.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">That is what led to the recent discoveries with regard to burger meat. The fact that these discoveries were made in Ireland is testament to how rigorous and scientific our examination is of food. The reputation of Irish food is of tremendous importance and value to the country and the farmers who produce it. This is part of the reason Ireland has such a strong international reputation. With regard to the recent controversy, there are strong indications that all of the companies which have changed suppliers have indicated they will consider sourcing meat and products from other Irish suppliers.

I am happy to say the new IT structures, although it is taking time to put them in place, are capable of dealing with the increased volume of applications under all scheme headings.

          <p eId="para_195">Aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Cuív. Ritheann sé seo le roinnt des na leasuithe a leagadh síos agamsa. Ba chóir go mbeadh an smacht ag Tithe an Oireachtais, ina iomlán, maidir leis an gcaighdeán oifigiúil, ach go háirithe ó thaobh stair na teanga agus cé chomh tábhachtach is ata sí, agus toisc gur teanga í atá in ísle brí in áiteanna. Ba chóir go mbeimís cinnte go bhfuil an Ghaeilge lárnach, ó thaobh an Stáit de, agus go bhfuil an smacht iomlán ag an Stát chun déanamh cinnte go bhfuil an teanga bheo bheathach agus go bhfuil struchtúir leagtha síos di. Tá teangacha ina déantar sin agus tá teangacha eile nach bhfuil aon stádas oifigiúil acu. Níl caighdeán oifigiúil ag an mBéarla, mar shampla. Féachtar chuig Oxford, Cambridge nó a leithéid ach níl aon chaighdeán oifigiúil maidir leis an Stát. Ins an Fhrainc, tá caighdeán oifigiúil leagtha síos ach ins an Iodáil, níl. Tá an oiread sin canúintí agus teangacha éagsúla ins an Iodáil agus tá stair chasta taobh thiar de theacht i réim na hIodáilise san Iodáil. Tarlaíonn an rud céanna i dtíortha eile.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> Sa tír seo, caithfimid déanamh cinnte de nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga ársa istigh i gcófra áit éigin agus go bhféachaimid uirthi anois is arís, ach gur teanga bheo bheathach í a ghluaiseann leis na hathruithe ins an tsochaí, ach go háirithe ins an ré atá ann faoi láthair, ré na heolaíochta agus na ríomhairí nuair atá rudaí ag athrú cuíosach tapaidh agus nuair atá a lán tionchar ag cultúir lasmuigh den tír ar an dteanga. Tá sé tábhachtach dá réir go bhfuil an teanga lárnach i dTithe an Oireachtais agus go bhfuil an t-Oireachtas gafa go hiomlán le cosaint na Gaeilge agus le déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an caighdeán oifigiúil ag dul leis an lá atá inniu ann. </p>

          <p eId="para_197">Tá sé mar cheann de phríomh aidhmeanna na reachtaíochta, soiléireacht a thabhairt maidir le caighdeán oifigiúil na Gaeilge. Leagann an Bille síos go soiléir gur ar Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais a bheas an fhreagracht an caighdeán oifigiúil a athbhreithniú go tréimhsiúil de réir mar is cuí. Bhí gá leis an tsoiléireacht mar gheall ar chinntí a tógadh sula dtáinig an Rialtas seo i bhfeidhm, cinntí a chiallaigh go raibh dhá rannóg aistriúcháin faoi leith ag plé le haistriúchán reachtaíochta agus le caighdeán oifigiúil na Gaeilge. Ní chabhraíonn easpa soiléireachta leo siúd a bhaineann úsaid rialta as focal scríofa na Gaeilge, ach go háirithe in earnálacha an oideachais, an aistriúcháin agus na cumarsáide.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> Le halt 2 den mBille, mar atá sé dréachtaithe, beidh sé soiléir nach bhfuil stádas reachtúil ach ag "An Caighdeán Oifigiúil" a d'fhoilsigh rannóg aistriúchán Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais i 2012 agus aon leagan eile a fhoilseoidh an rannóg amach anseo. </p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Tá obair fhiúntach déanta ag an gcoiste stiúrtha, mar a luaigh mé an lá cheana, a bhunaigh an Rialtas roimhe seo chun moltaí a dhéanamh maidir leis an gcaighdeán a thabhairt suas chun dáta. Tá na moltaí sin anois curtha faoi bhráid Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais le tabhairt san áireamh sa chéad athbhreithniú eile a déanfar laistigh des na trí bliana amach romhainn, mar a luaigh mé an lá cheana chomh maith. </p>

          <p eId="para_201">Téann seo go croí lár na ceiste maidir leis an reachtaíocht seo. Tá dhá cheist ann. Ceist a haon, cé is ceart an caighdeán a réiteach? Dar liomsa, má táthar ag leasú an dlí ba cheart go dtabharfaí an cumhacht sin don Rialtas. Tá laigí móra san mBille, mar tugann sé ceart do Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais leasuithe a dhéanamh ar an gcaighdeán scun scan ar éinne eile sa saol. Féadfaidh an coimisiún dul i gcomhairle ach ní deirtear go gcaithfidh sé dul i gcomhairle. Tá sin mícheart agus ba cheart go mbeadh cumhacht ag an Rialtas ar an gceist seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> Ceist a dó, an dara laige leis an mBille ná, mar is eol don Aire Stáit, gur bunaíodh an dara aonad aistriúcháin mar go raibh teipthe ar Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais coinneáil suas leis an ualach oibre a bhí air maidir le haistriú Achtanna de chuid an Oireachtais. Gan an cheist sin a réiteach, gan aon smacht ag an Rialtas air, agus teipeanna an dualgas sin a chomhlíonadh curtha faoi ndeara do Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais, caitheann an Rialtas dualgais bhreise anonn air. Is laige mhór í sin. Áit ar bith san mBille níl fuascailt na faidhbe maidir leis an teip ghlan ag Coimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais déanamh cinnte go gcomhlíonann sé a ndualgais dlí agus bunreachta maidir le haistriú Achtanna. Anois, tá an Rialtas ag tabhairt breis cúramaí don choimisiún agus níl aon fhreagra ag an Aire Stáit ar an gceist seo a leanas. Muna bhfuil an coimisiún in ann an jab atá aige a dhéanamh cén chaoi a dhéanfaidh sé an obair bhreise? </p>
          <p eId="para_203"> An rud a bhí déanta ag an Rialtas roimhe seo ná déanamh cinnte de, ar a laghad maidir le hionstraim reachtúla, go mbeadh smacht díreach ag an Rialtas ar an bhfreagracht maidir le haistriú na n-ionstram reachtúla.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">Bhí mé ag cur mo nótaí le chéile nuair a sheas mé don chéad uair, agus seo an rud atá i gceist agam. Ní aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Cuív sa chás seo. Aontaím gur chóir go mbeadh an smacht ag Tithe an Oireachtais. Mar a mholaim i leasú 16, is gá do Thithe an Oireachtais, tríd rannóg an aistriúcháin, dul i gcomhairle le daoine eile maidir leis an gcaighdeán oifigiúil. Orainne, atá tofa ag muintir na hÉireann, atá an cumhacht agus an dualgas an Ghaeilge a chosaint agus í a chur chun cinn. Mar chuid de sin, ba chóir go mbéadh an caighdeán oifigiúil ullmhaithe faoinár dtreoir.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> Fágann an Bille go mbeidh sé ceadaithe príobháidiú a dhéanamh ar obair na rannóige agus go gcuirfear cuid den obair ar riaráistí Billí amach ar chonradh. Tá dáinséar i gcónái ansin, agus tiocfaidh mé ar ais chuige sin. Ach an rud atá i gceist agam anois go mbeadh dream amháin i mbun na hoibre. San Fhrainc, fágtar an cúram faoin Académie française. In Éirinn, rannóg an aistriúcháin atá i gceannas ar an gcaighdeán oifigiúil agus ba chóir go bhfanfadh sé sin mar atá sé, ach ba cheart go mbeadh ar an rannóg comhairle a ghlacadh. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta Ó Cuív sa mhéid sin. Sin an fáth go bhfuil coiste stiúrtha ann, a bhfuil sé de ról aige an chomhairle sin a thabhairt. Nuair atá rannóg an aistriúcháin ag cur an chaighdeáin le chéile, ba chóir go mbeadh iallach air éisteacht a thabhairt don choiste stiúrtha agus dul dá réir. </p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Sa deireadh thiar thall is faoi stiúradh Thithe an Oireachtais a bheadh an caighdeán oifigiuil, mar a bhí anuraidh nuair a foilsíodh An Caighdeán Oifigiúil is déanaí. Tithe an Oireachtais a d'fhoilsigh é. Foireann Thithe an Oireachtais a bhí i gceannas air agus ba chóir go bhfanfadh sin mar atá. </p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Tá an ceart ag an Teachta Ó Cuív nach fiú tráithnín é sin muna bhfuil na hachmhainní cuí ag an rannóg chun an jab tábhachtach sin a dhéanamh. Sa Fhrainc, ach go háirithe, tá seasamh mór ag an Académie Française i measc an phobail toisc an ról atá aige an teanga a chosaint, ní hamháin caighdeán oifigiúil a cur amach ach an teanga féin a chosaint i gcoinne Béarlachais agus a leithéid.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Uaireanta bíonn troid tógtha dá réir. Tá na Francaigh ag déanamh an iomarca cosanta ar a dteanga féin agus bheadh sé go hiontach dá mbeadh an sórt sin argóinte againne maidir leis an nGaeilge, go raibh an iomarca cosaint a dhéanamh ó thaobh an Bhéarlachais agus go mbeadh an teanga a labhairt ag an leibhéal céanna agus atá sa Fhrainc. Níl faoi láthair ach sin an aidhm atá againn ar fad anseo.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">An chumhacht a fhágáil ag an Rialtas. Ní aontaím gur ag an Rialtas ba chóir go mbeadh an fhreagracht seo. Tá an fhreagracht seo á tabhairt do Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais agus tá difir eatarthu. Baill Oireachtais atá ann ar an Choimisiún agus tá lán muiníne agam go ndéanfaidh siad an rud ceart. Beidh ionchur againn uilig as seo amach agus is fearr sin in ionad é a fhágáil ag Rialtas amháin nó Rialtas eile. Tá lán-mhuiníne agam i gCoimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais go ndéanfaidh sé an rud ceart agus nach mbeimid ag brath ar an Rialtas. Sin ceann de na gearáin atá againn, go bhfuil gach rud faoin Rialtas. Aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Snodaigh ar an phointe gur chóir go bhfágfaí é i gCoimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais agus tá daoine ó gach taobh Tí air sin agus is féidir leo monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar an chur i bhfeidhm agus ar an éifeacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Maidir le foireann, tá foireann an lár-aonaid aistriúcháin aistrithe go dtí Rannóg an Aistriúcháin agus mar sin tá daoine breise ann.

          <p eId="para_211">Go loighiciúil, luíonn sé le réasún dá mbeadh an t-aistriúchán ar fad oifigiúil á dhéanamh in aon áit amháin. Níl aon mhaith leis sin mura bhfuil an dream atá ceaptha an obair sin a dhéanamh gan a bheith in ann é a dhéanamh. Dá mba rud é gur tháinig duine isteach anseo agus plean le cur os ár gcomhair a fuarthas ó Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais a chruthódh dúinn go bhféadfaí an t-aistriúchán ar fad a dhéanamh taobh de na Tithe anseo, ghlacfainn leis an rud atá á dhéanamh ag an Aire Stáit maidir leis na daoine a bhí ag obair sa Roinn a aistriú isteach faoi chúram na dTithe. Ach ar nós go leor eile, níl an plean sin ag an Aire Stáit. Tá sé ag rá linn go bhfuil an reachtaíocht seo ag dul á achtú go fíor-luath agus níl aon phlean go bhfuil sin le réiteach i láthair na huaire. Cad é an deifir? Dá ndéanfaí rudaí ar an mbealach ceart, gheofadh an tAire Stáit an plean i dtosach, dhéanfadh sé a scagadh agus a chur faoi bhráid na Dála agus nuair a bheadh sin déanta agus gach duine sásta go mbeadh an coimisiún in ann a chuid freagrachtaí a chomhlíonadh i dtaobh Achtanna agus i dtaobh ionstram reachtúla. Ansin, bheinn breá-sásta go n-aistreofaí na cúraimí a bhí ar an Roinn isteach faoin choimisiún. An fhadhb atá ag an Aire Stáit i gcónaí ná go gcuireann sé an cart roimh an gcapall.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Maidir leis an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil, baineann an caighdeán leis an bpobal. Tá dhá chaighdeán ann i láthair na huaire mar nach raibh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin sásta bheith páirteach sa choiste a bunaíodh faoin Rialtas deireanach le hathbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an gcaighdeán. Nuair a bhí a chuid oibre á déanamh ag an gcoiste ar ar cheart do Rannóg an Aistriúcháin a bheith ag freastal air, ach gur dhiúltaigh sí freastal air, chuathas i gcomhairle leis an bpobal ag gach aon chéim den phróiseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> An dara rud ná go raibh na haicmí ar fad lena mbaineann an caighdeán páirteach ann. Ní bhaineann an caighdeán díreach le reachtaíocht amháin agus cúrsaí teanga do reachtaíocht. Baineann sé le hobair agus saol laethúil na Gaeilge.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> Nuair a bhí an obair sin ar bun, in ionad páirt a ghlacadh san obair, dhiúltaigh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin páirt a ghlacadh inti. Céard a rinne an rannóg? Dream nach bhfuil in ann a dhualgas a chomhlíonadh maidir le haistriú Achtanna, tharraing sé foireann a bhí ceaptha a bheith ag aistriú Achtanna le go mbeidís ar fáil sa dá theanga oifigiúla don phobal ón obair sin agus réitigh sé leagan nua den Chaighdeán Oifigiúil gan dul i gcomhairle le héinne, agus gan aon ionchur ag na daoine ar fad, idir lucht na cumarsáide agus mar sin, atá ag plé le cúrsaí na Gaeilge. Tá sé spéisiúil má léann duine brollach an fhoclóra a sheol an tUachtarán an tseachtain seo caite go bhfeicfear ann go bhfuil sé bunaithe ar an gcaighdeán a réitigh an coiste a bhunaigh an Rialtas deireanach, níl sé bunaithe ar an gcaighdeán nua rúnda seo a tháinig amach gan aon dul i gcomhairle ó Rannóg an Aistriúcháin. Mar sin tá bun lochtanna le cur chuige an Aire Stáit. </p>
          <p eId="para_215"> D’fhéadfadh sé cuid den rud seo a cheartú dá mbeadh sé sásta glacadh le leasuithe ar an mBille seo. Dá mbeadh an tAire Stáit sásta cur isteach sa Bhille go gcaithfidh Caighdeán Oifigiúil nua faoin mBille a thabhairt amach laistigh de bhliain a thabharfadh san áireamh an obair a rinne an coiste a bhunaigh an Rialtas deireanach agus dá mba rud é go mbeadh sé sásta leasú a ghlacadh a chuirfeadh mar dhualgas ar Rannóg an Aistriúcháin coiste a bhunú ar a mbeadh na daoine ainmnithe atá ainmnithe agam i leasú eile, móide daoine eile. Dá ndéanfaí é sin, réiteofaí na fadhbanna a tharraing Rannóg an Aistriúcháin orainn sa chás seo. Ar chuma rún-diamhar éigin, tá sé mar bheart ag an Aire Stáit gan ghlacadh ar aon leasú ar aon Bhille, ceap magaidh a dhéanamh den Teach seo agus gan aon ionchur a thabhairt do dhaoine atá ag obair go crua anseo agus ag cur moltaí ar aghaidh. Tá sórt deachtóireachta bunaithe ag an Aire Stáit nach éistíonn le tuairim éinne eile. Mar sin, ní bheidh na hAchtanna tugtha chun dáta agus na haistriúcháin ar fáil taobh istigh de trí bliana fiú. Chomh maith leis sin, ní bheidh aon chinnteacht ann go mbeidh comhphlé le dreamanna eile i réiteach an Chaighdeáin Oifigiúil agus mar sin, tá an Bille seo thar a bheith lochtach ó thús go deireadh. Níl an tAire Stáit ag tabhairt aghaidh ar na feidhmeanna éagsúla. </p>
          <p eId="para_216">Tá rudaí chomh dona do Teachtaí Dála atá ag iarraidh aon obair a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge agus atá ag iarraidh oibriú ar Bhillí agus a chaitheas breathnú ar sean Achtanna de chuid an Oireachtais go raibh ormsa gearán a dhéanamh leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga mar nach bhfuil leagan Gaeilge de na hAchtanna ar fáil dúinn lenár gcuid oibre laethúil a dhéanamh. Níl na leaganacha sin ann do mo leithéid, atá ceaptha ag an bpobal le bheith páirteach in obair reachtaíochta sa Teach seo.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">Sílim go gcaithfidh muid amharc chun tosaigh. Aontaím leis an Teachta nach raibh gach rud i gceart san am atá thart. Bhí riaráistí maidir le haistriú na mBillí agus maidir le aistriú na n-ionstraimí reachtúla. Tharla sé sin uilig. Níor shíl me nuair a tháinig mé isteach go raibh fuascailt na ceiste againn. Nílim chun dul siar ar an stair ar cad a tharla le tamall anuas, go raibh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin agus an Lárionad Aistriúcháin ann agus go raibh a gcaighdeán féin ag gach dream. Tuigeann duine ar bith a bhfuil ciall nó tuiscint ar bith aige nach bhféadfadh muid dul ar aghaidh mar sin. Bheadh muid inár gceap magaidh. Caithfimid caighdeán amháin a bheith againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> Ní shílim go bhfuil dream ar bith gur féidir leo é sin a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí ná an dream atá ann ó bunaíodh an t-Oireachtas, Rannóg an Aistriúcháin. Is iad a chuir An Caighdeán Oifigiúil ar fáil go dtí seo agus sílim go bhfuil an taithí, an t-eolas agus an traidisiún acu chun leanúint ar aghaidh le sin. Táim ag breathnú ar an am amach romhainn. Maidir leis an bhfoireann a bhí ag an lárionad aistriúcháin, tá sé tugtha isteach anois go dtí Rannóg an Aistriúcháin agus cuirfidh sé sin go mór lena n-éifeacht. Tá plean á ullmhú ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin chun tabhairt faoi na riaráistí. Ar ndóigh, is oidhreacht iad sin a tháinig chugam agus b'fhéidir go raibh siad d'oidhreacht ag an Teachta féin chomh maith, ach tá muid chun tabhairt fúthu anois. Is ceist riaracháin í sin agus tá an plean á ullmhú. Níl dabht ar bith ná go rachaimid ar aghaidh le sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> Mar adúirt mé, tá mé ag iarraidh rudaí a chur ina gceart. Táim ag iarraidh an rud a shíl an saol mór gur ceart a dhéanamh a dhéanamh, mar nach féidir le dhá rannóg a bheith amuigh ansin ag déanamh na hoibre chéanna. Caithfimid breathnú ar aghaidh agus ceacht a fhoghlaim ón rud a chuaigh thart, ach gan a bheith ag díriú isteach barraíocht air. Caithfimid pleanáil don am atá romhainn. Sin an rud atá sa Bhille seo, go mbeidh dream amháin, go mbeidh údarás amháin agus go mbeidh rannóg amháin ag déileáil leis an gcaighdeán. Beidh freagracht ag an dream sin as agus beidh cúraimí caighdeáin orthu ó seo amach. Tá sin ag dul chuig an dream a bhí á dhéanamh i gcónaí go dtí seo, Rannóg an Aistriúcháin. Beidh tuilleadh cuidiú acu. Lena chois sin - tá seo sa Bhille nios faide ar aghaidh - beidh siad ábalta daoine ón taobh amuigh a bhfuil an inniúlacht agus na cáilíochtaí agus na teistiméireachtaí acu a thabhairt isteach sa mheitheal chomh maith.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">Seo ceist thar a bheith spéisiúil. Tá sé ráite sa Bhille, lch 7 líne 17, go mbeidh An Caighdeán Oifigiúil "... agus arna fhoilsiú faoi chóipcheart Rialtais, atá le húsáid sa reachtaíocht phríomha agus sa reachtaíocht thánaisteach agus mar an treoir le haghaidh scríbhneoireacht sa Ghaeilge". Ardaíonn sé seo ceist spéisiúil. Más rud é nach gcloítear 100% leis an gcaighdeán i réiteach reachtaíochta nó i réiteach reachtaíochta thánaisteach, an bhféadfadh duine ordú a fháil i gcúirt nach seasann an reachtaíocht?</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé scríofa in aon áit eile go gcaithfidh an reachtaíocht le bheith bailí a bheith caighdeánach go huile agus go hiomlán. Mar shampla, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon dualgas ar iad siúd atá ag scríobh reachtaíochta i mBéarla glacadh le caighdeán an Bhéarla, mar ní dóigh liom go bhfuil caighdeán i mBéarla mar atá i nGaeilge. Bheadh sé spéisiúil a fháil amach an gcaithfidh éinne in aon tír eile ar domhan, mar shampla, cloí leis an gcaighdeán oifigiúil go huile agus go hiomlán gan aon imeacht uaidh, dubh, bán ná riabhach i scríobh reachtaíochta nó i scríobh reachtaíochta thánaisteach. An bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit a rá linn go dearfach an bhféadfadh duine cás cúirte a thabhairt in aghaidh reachtaíochta ar an mbunús nár chloigh an reachtaíocht sin go huile agus go hiomlán leis an gcaighdeán? Ar ndóigh, is iomaí argóinte a bhíonn ann faoin gcaighdeán.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> An ceart go dtabharfaí mar threoir, dá ndéanfadh duine imeacht ón gcaighdeán ar aon bhealach beag ag aon am, nach mbeadh aon bhunús ag éinne cás cúirte a thógáil faoin sin? Ba mhaith liom míniú ar seo a fháil ón Aire stáit. An bhfuil sé 100% cinnte nach bhféadfadh duine éigin cás éigin a thógáil nár chloí aon phíosa reachtaíochta go huile agus go hiomlán le gach aon bhriathar atá sa gcaighdéan?</p>

          <p eId="para_226"> Measaim gur cóir go mbeadh caighdeán amháin ann agus go mbeach gach píosa reachtaíochta bunaithe ar an chaighdeán sin, mar a tharlaíonn sa bhFrainc. Tá an cheist ardaithe ag an Teachta, ach níl tuairim daingin agam uirthi, toisc nár chuala mé freagra ó na teangeolaithe, ó Rannóg an Aistriúcháin, nó ó na habhcóidí ar a mbeadh dualgas déileáil le cásanna faoi seo dá mbeadh a leithéid ann. Seo an fhadhb atá againn le cuid mhaith de na leasuithe atá curtha chun cinn againn inniu. Tá cinneadh tógtha go bhfuil cuid mhaith díobh as ord. B'fhéidir go gcabhródh sé leis an Teachta Ó Cuív dá ndéarfadh mé leis na cinn a leag mise isteach atá as ord. Is iad uimh. 1, 4, 5, 6, 13 agus ó 19 go dtí 23.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">An fáth gur luaigh me iad sin mar nach raibh Céim an Choiste ceart againn ag an gCéim sin. Ní ar duine amháin atá an locht faoi sin, baineann cuid den locht linne, cuid leis an Aire Stáit agus cuid leis an gCathaoirleach a bhí againn ar an lá. Ní raibh aon deifir leis an reachtaíocht. Ghlac muid leis ag an am go mbeadh muid ag teacht ar ais anseo i gceann míosa nó níos mó agus go mbeadh muid in ann breis taighde a dhéanamh. Ní raibh dóthain ama agam sa choicís nó níos lú atá caite ó bhí Céim an Choiste againn chun dul go domhain isteach sna ceisteanna a ardaíodh ansin inar chuir mé spéis. Sin an fáth go bhfuil spéis agam sa cheist atá ardaithe ag an Teachta Ó Cuív. Sa Fhrainc, mar shampla, táthar an-dáiríre mar gheall ar an chaighdeán oifigiúil atá acu agus tá an-chosaint á dhéanamh acu air.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Tá raic mór le tamall de bhlianta maidir le <i>la ministre</i> nó <i>le ministre</i>. Tá sé sin tábhachtach ó thaobh inscne de. Níor bhain an raic sin le reachtaíocht. Dúirt duine i bParlaimint na Fraince gur úsáideadh an inscne mícheart. Tá sé tábhachtach, go háirithe nuair atá an dlí i gceist, go bhfuil úsáid na teanga go hiomlán beacht. Tharla cásanna thar na blianta ina raibh reachtaíocht neamhbheacht. Ba chóir go mbeadh reachtaíocht dréachtaithe de réir an chaighdeáin. Conas is féidir linn a chinntiú anois, agus caighdeán nua againn, go bhfuil gach rud a tháinig ón uair a bunaíodh an Caighdéan Oifigiúil i réim? Cén caighdéan a bhainfidh le reachtaíocht a ritheadh tamall de bhlianta ó shin, roimh teacht i réim an chaighdeáin nua - Caighdeán Oifigiúil 1958 nó Caighdeán Oifigiúil 2013? An mbeidh dabht ann? Is ceist an-teicniúil é. Nuair atáimid ag déileáil le reachtaíocht, ba chóir go mbeadh an deis seo againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> Is mór an trua é nach raibh dóthain ama ag Teachtaí agus ag an Aire Stáit dul i ngleic go huile is go hiomlán le roinnt de na pointí seo. Bheadh sé níos fearr dá mbeadh an t-ábhar seo pléite againn le lucht Rannóg an Aistriúcháin roimh Chéim an Choiste. Níl mé ar an gcoiste sin. B'fhéidir gur botún a bhí ann nach raibh mé gafa go huile is go hiomlán leis an reachtaíocht seo nuair a foilsíodh ar dtús é. Ní raibh mé in ann impí ar an gcoiste dream ón gcoiste téarmaíochta, Rannóg an Aistriúcháin nó an ghrupá atá ag cur an foclóir nua a luaigh an Teacht Ó Cuív le chéile, a thógáil isteach. Níor éirigh linn go leor cúloibre a dhéanamh a chabhródh linn sa mhéid atá le déanamh againn inniu. Tá dainséar ann go ndéanfaimid botún nó nach mbeidh an reachtaíocht chomh foirfe is ba chóir.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> Dúirt mé ar an Dara Chéim gur cheart foclóir nua téarmaíochta parlaiminte a fhoilsiú. Tá foclóir parlaiminteach ann. Níl an foclóir nua úsáideach go fóill - níl ach 30% de críochnaithe. Ní raibh mé in ann teacht ar an dá fhocal a lorg mé san fhoclóir. Ní fiú tráithnín é, fad is atá botúin den tsórt sin ann, nuair atá pointí teicniúla á lorg againn atá an Ghaeilge ar ár gcumas againn. Nuair atá an foclóir iomlán curtha le chéile, beimid in ann teacht ar na focail sin. Tá mé ag tnúth leis. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé críochnaithe chomh tapaidh agus is féidir. Is léir ón gcuid a chonaic mé go mbeidh sé áisiúl, go háirithe sa lá atá inniu ann nuair atá gach rud leictreonach. Ba cheart go mbeimid in ann teacht ar fhoclóir cruinn beacht ar barr ár méire.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Níl mé gafa le haon taobh nó taobh eile. Tá mé ag dul i dtreo atá glactha ag an Aire Stáit faoi láthair, toisc gur chóir go mbeimid cinnte go bhfuil leagan amháin den teanga in úsáid i reachtaíocht. An féidir leis an Aire Stáit soiléiriú a thabhairt dúinn maidir le reachtaíocht a fhoilsíodh i mBéarla tamall de bhlianta ó shin ach nach bhfuil aistrithe go dtí seo? An mbeidh an reachtaíocht sin aistrithe de réir an chaighdeáin nua nó de réir an tsean-chaighdeáin? Os rud é go raibh siad le n-aistriú tamall de bhlianta ó shin, is dóigh liom gur chóir go mbeadh siad aistrithe de réir an tsean-chaighdeáin. Is cuimhin liom an argóint a rinne mé anseo sa bhliain 2006, nuair a bhí muid ag déileáil le reachtaíocht a bhí ag déanamh athruithe ar Acht Choláiste Phríomh-Scoile na Gaillimhe 1929. Ag an am sin, ní raibh an tAcht úd ar fáil i nGaeilge. Níl a fhios agam fiú an bhfuil sé ar fáil i nGaeilge go fóill. Cén caighdeán a bheadh in úsáid dá mbeadh aistriú á dhéanamh ar an Acht sin anois? Is ceist teicniúil í seo.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">Aontaím nach bhfuil aon spás d'éiginnteacht nó débhríocht nuair atá reachtaíocht á n-aistriú ó theanga oifigiúil amháin go dtí teanga oifigiúil eile. Baineann tábhacht ar leith leis seo i gcás na Gaeilge, ní hamháin in Éirinn ach freisin san Aontas Eorpach, áit ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge aitheanta mar theanga oifigiúil agus oibre. Agus é sin ráite, tá raon leathan roghanna curtha san áireamh sa Chaighdeán Oifigiúil, a d'fhoilsigh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin anuraidh. Measaim gur leor na roghanna sin chun foclaíocht cruinn a bheith in aon reachtaíocht a dhéantar amach anseo. Ní trí thimpiste atá alt 2 dréachtaithe mar atá sé. Ciallaíonn an cur chuige atá beartaithe gurb é an Caighdeán Oifigiúil amháin a bheidh inghlactha chun críche reachtaíochta. Laghdóidh an cur chuige seo an seans go mbeidh Achtanna an Oireachtais nó reachtaíocht thánaisteach débhríoch. Mar a dúirt mé, tá roghanna sa chaighdeán. Tá gach píosa reachtaíochta atá aistrithe ó 1958 ar aghaidh bunaithe ar an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil.</p>

Tá difríochtaí idir an dá cháipéis. Chuaigh NEID leis an dréacht-chaighdeán a bhí réitithe ag an gcoiste, rud a dhiúltaigh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin, mar bhíodar páirteach ann. Tá na difríochtaí seo ann. Cuirfidh mé ceist an-díreach agus an-simplí ar an Aire Stáit. Tá sé tar éis an focal "bunaithe" a úsáid mar théarma.

          <p eId="para_241">Is é an freagra atá ann mar sin ná nach bhfuair an tAire Stáit comhairle. Dar ndóigh, mar adúirt an Teachta Ó Snodaigh, b'fhéidir gur mion phointe é. Dá dtiocfadh an tAire Stáit ar ais ar Chéim an Choiste nó ar Chéim na Tuarascála inniu - sin an gnáth phróiseas reachtaíochta sa Teach seo - agus a rá linn go raibh sé tar éis dul chuig an Ard-Aighe agus go raibh an tArd-Aighne tar éis a shoiléiriú dó, ainneoin an rud atá an tAire Stáit ag iarraidh a chur sa reachtaíocht, nach mbeidh aon chontúirt ann don reachtaíocht dá rachfaí ar strae beagáinín ón gcaighdeán, bheadh mise sásta glacadh le sin. Ach, is léir ón bhfreagra a thug sé nach bhfuil sé in ann é sin a rá.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">I move amendment No. 7:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_250"> In page 8, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_251">“(2E) Any such translations carried out by a person other than the Commission shall be referred to the Commission for consideration and approval. Such translations shall not be published until such time as the Commission has granted their approval of the translation.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_252">(2F) Without prejudice to subsection (2D), the Government shall endeavour to consolidate the process of translating primary and secondary legislation and all relevant documentation in the Commission, and endeavour that all staff within departments responsible for the translation of legislation shall where possible be reassigned to the Commission.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Baineann an cheist seo le déanamh cinnte de na rudaí seo amach anseo. Tá riaráistí ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin, nó ag Tithe an Oireachtais. Tá an locht orainne, mar is muide atá i gceannas ar reachtaíocht, nach bhfuil Achtanna agus ionstraimí reachtúla atá rite ag an Teach seo ar fáil as Gaeilge. Sa leasú seo, tá mise ag iarraidh dhá foráileacha breise a chur isteach sa Bhille a thabharfaidh seans don Aire Stáit daoine a fhostú chun déileáil le gnéithe den obair sin. </p>
          <p eId="para_254"> An príomh rud atá i gceist, agus téann seo leis an plé dearfa a bhí againn, ná go mbeidh caighdeán amháin maidir le reachtaíocht - go mbeidh stíl amháin againn, go mbeidh na téarmaí céanna in úsáid agus nach mbeidh aon éiginnteacht i gceist. Is cóir go mbeadh dream amháin i gceannas. Ní cóir go mbeadh dream aistritheoirí amuigh ansin ar chonradh, ag aistriú reachtaíochta chun déileáil le riaráistí mar go bhfuil Rannóg an Aistriúcháin faoi bhrú agus go gcaithfear deifir a dhéanamh leis an aistriúchán, gan cinnteacht faoin gcaighdeán a bheith ann. Ba chóir go mbeadh cinnteacht ann, nuair a thiocfadh aon aistriúchán ar reachtaíocht ar ais ó aistritheoirí seachtracha, go mbreathnódh an coimisiun agus Rannóg an Aistriúcháin chuige go gcloínn sé leis an gcaighdeán. Ba chóir go mbeadh an caighdeán is airde ó thaobh an dlí de sroichte acu agus ba chóir go mbeadh an téarmaíocht agus an foclóir cuí in úsáid acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> Mar a luaitear sa leasú, baineann sé le "próiseas aistriúcháin na reachtaíochta príomha agus tánaistí agus na doiciméadachta iomchuí go léir a chomhdhlúthú sa Choimisiún". Ní cóir go mbeadh breis costas ar an Stát maidir le seo, mar tá foireann againn cheana féin. Is oth liom gur ordaíodh as ord roinnt de na leasuithe a d'ardaigh mé toisc go gcreidtear go bhfuil costais i gceist. Is ag iarraidh costas a shábháil a bhí mé. Bhí mé ag iarraidh deiridh a chur leis an gá obair a chur amach ar chonradh amach anseo. Bhí mé ag iarraidh go bhfoilseofaí gach Bille agus ionstraim go comhuaineach ionas go mbeadh sé éasca teacht ar an aistriúcháin Gaeilge nó Béarla ag deireadh an phrósis.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> Is féidir é sin a dhéanamh, mar atá léirithe leis an mBille seo atá againn i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla. Má ritear an Bille inniu, beifear in ann é a fhoilsiú amárach, mar tá sé aistrithe cheana féin. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé mar an gcéanna le gach Bille. Ba chóir go mbeadh mise nó aon Teachta eile in ann ár leasuithe a chur isteach i nGaeilge nó i mBéarla agus ba chóir go mbeadh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin in ann déileáil leo ar an bhonn sin. Leis an leasú, táim ag iarraidh a dhéanamh cinnte de, má chuirtear an obair seo amach ar chonradh chuig aistritheoirí, toisc go bhfuil riaráistí ann, go ndéanfaí an obair sinn go caighdeánach. Tá riaráistí ann mar nach raibh na hacmhainní cuí ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin anseo thar na cianta. Níl an locht ar an Rialtas seo, nó fiú ar an Rialtas deiridh. D'éirigh na riaráistí aníos thar na cianta mar níor thug muid faoi seo i gceart. An chúis le sin ná níor tugadh tús áite don Ghaeilge i dTithe an Oireachtais riamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> I mo thuairim, tá éacht déanta ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin thar na blianta leis an méid atá déanta acu. B'fhéidir go mba chóir go mbeadh níos mó déanta acu, ach ní raibh foireann iomlán acu i gcónaí. Go bhfios dom, níl foireann iomlán acu faoi láthair. Tá daoine imithe ar phinsean agus daoine imithe chuig an Eoraip nó tá daoine tinn. Tá súil agam nach dtiocfaidh tuilleadh riaráistí aníos dá bharr sin. Má thagann, tugann an t-alt seo den Bhille cumhacht do Thithe an Oireachtais a dhéanamh cinnte de nach gcuirfí leis na riaráistí agus gur féidir le daoine ar chonradh tabhairt fúthu. Aontaím le sin ach an fhadhb atá agam nach bhfuil foráil sa reachtaíocht go gcaithfí an t-aistriúchán a ndéanfar lasmuigh de Thithe an Oireachtais teacht ar ais chuig Rannóg an Aistriúcháin chun a dhéanamh cinnte de go bhfuil sé go huile agus go hiomlán foirfe ó thaobh an chaighdeáin de. Is cóir go mbeadh an stíl céanna ann agus an foclóir agus téarmaíocht céanna in úsáid ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> Glacaim leis go mbeidh scrúdú de shaghas éigin déanta maidir le aon aistritheoir seachtrach a bheidh ag obair mar seo, chun a dhéanamh cinnte go dtuigeann sé nó sí na rialacha. Fiú nuair a dtuigeann daoine na rialacha, ní chloíonn siad go hiomlán leo agus b'fhéidir go mbeadh ar an rannóg mion athruithe a dhéanamh nuair a thiocfadh an t-aistriúchán thar nais. Sin an fáth leis an leasú seo. Táim ag iarraidh a dhéanamh cinnte nach mbeidh dhá stíl i gceist maidir le reachtaíocht amach anseo.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">Tá lúcháir orm a rá go n-aontaím leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Teachta. Aontaímíd le chéile ar aon chuma faoin obair fhiúntach agus thairbheach atá déanta ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin le blianta fada.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé sin ar an gclár agus aontaímíd lena chéile air sin gan dabht ar bith.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> Is cinnte nár éirigh le Rannóg an Aistriúcháin gach rud a dhéanamh agus go raibh deacrachtaí le foirne agus mar sin de. De thairbhe an Bhille seo tá an fhoireann a bhí ag an lár-ionad aistriúcháin aistrithe agus beidh siad sin mar chuidiú ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin chun an obair thábhachtach atá idir láimhe aige a thabhairt chun críche.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> Maidir leis an leasú fein, is é an sprioc atá leis an Bhille ná comhdhlúthú a dhéanamh ar sheirbhísí aistriúcháin an Stáit. Is é an rud atá á dhéanamh, go bhfuiltear ag tabhairt an dá cheann, Rannóg an Aistriúcháin agus an lár-ionad aistriúcháin, le chéile arís.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> Is ag Coimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais amháin atá an fheidhm maidir le hAchtanna a aistriú cheana féin. Cé go bhfuil feidhm maidir le hionstraimí reachtúla á thabhairt do Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais tríd an mBille seo, tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh solúbthacht áirithe fágtha ag Airí Rialtais chun a gcuid socraithe féin a dhéanamh nuair is gá. Cabhróidh an tsolúbthacht seo le moill maidir le haistriúcháin a sheachaint. Chun cabhrú leis an bproiséas seo, tuigtear go mbeidh sé i gceist ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin treoirlínte a eisiúint chuig na Ranna éagsúla ina dtabharfar treoracha maidir le haistriú ionstraimí reachtúla. Clúdóidh na treoirlínte nithe ar nós leagan amach na n-ionstraimí reachtúla, téarmaíocht le húsáid, na foinsí reachtúla agus tacaíochta atá ar fáil, an stíl scríbhneóireachta atá le húsáid agus an leagan críochnaitheach a mbeifí ag súil leis. Tá mé sásta go gcinnteoidh an socrú seo go mbeidh caighdeánú déanta ar ionstraimí reachtúla agus iad á n-aistriú. Mar sin, beidh na treoirlínte ag dul amach chuig na Ranna agus beidh sólúbthacht ann gur féidir leis na Ranna an t-aistriúchán a fháil ach é a bheith bunaithe ar na treoirlínte a bheas ag dul amach ó Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais, nó Rannóg an Aistriúcháin. </p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Tá mé sásta go gcomhlíonann sé sin an dualgas.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_265">Tá mise in aghaidh an leasaithe seo. Go dtí seo, is iad na Ranna Stáit féin a rinne aistriú ar ionstraimí reachtúla. Bhí mé in aghaidh, i bprionsabal, go ndéanfadh rannóg an aistriúcháin é sin, ach iad a bheith in ann an jab a dhéanamh chomh mór agus is féidir. Ach, mar atá mé ag rá an t-am ar fad, is aisteach mar a ghlactar i gcás na Gaeilge le rudaí a bheith maith go leor. Tá teipthe glan ar Thithe an Oireachtais le fada an lá. Rinne mé iarracht, in Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, déileáil leis an gceist seo ach tá teipthe ar Thithe an Oireachtais a ndualgas bunreachtúil a chomhlíonadh maidir le haistriú Achtanna. Níl mé ag cur milleáin ar éinne faoi leith ach ar Thithe an Oireachtais, mar theip glan orthu. Tá dearcadh ó thaobh na Gaeilge de gur iontach an t-éacht leath jab a dhéanamh. Bhí dualgas ar an Oireachtas cloí leis an mBunreacht agus na hAchtanna a aistriú go Gaeilge. Ní ceart go mbeadh an dara cheist faoi sin. In aon tír eile ar domhan ní ghlacfaí leis go raibh éacht déanta nuair a bhí leath jab déanta. Níl mé ag cur locht ar dhuine ar bith. Tá daoine iontacha ag obair sa Teach seo ach níl an jab á dhéanamh. Ní fhéadfadh an milleán a bheith ar éinne ach orthu siúd atá freagrach as riarú an Tí seo, is í coiste Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais í.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> An fhadhb a bhaineann le leasú an Teachta Ó Snodaigh ná seo. Sa chás a ndeir foireann Rannóg an Aistriúcháin go bhfuil siad ró-ghnóthach le haistriú a dhéanamh nó le súil a chaitheamh ar aistriú atá déanta taobh amuigh, d'fhéadfadh moill a bheith ar aistriú ionstraimí reachtúla muna mbeadh sé de chumhacht agus de cheart ag Aire dul ag dream éigin eile agus é a fháil aistrithe. Bheadh ceangal na gcúig gcaol ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin agus ag Coimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais ar ionstraimí reachtúla. Dá mbeadh mise mar Aire níor mhaith liom, agus na riaráistí seo ar fad ag carnú suas, dul sa queue agus gan aon éalú as agam, nó dá dtiocfainn taobh amuigh de Thithe an Oireachtais le hionstraim reachtúil a fháil aistrithe, go gcaithfinn é a chur faoi bháid rannóg aistriúcháin an Tí seo, mar d'fhéadfainn bheith ag fanacht go lá an luain, agus b'fhéidir go mbeadh deifir orm mar Aire. Sa chás nach bhfuilimid cinnte gur féidir leis an rannóg an jab a dhéanamh fiú leis an bpríomh reachtaíocht, rud nach bhfuilimid mar níl aon plean againn, níor mhaith liomsa forlámhas iomlán a thabhairt dó ar na hionstraimí reachtúla.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> I bprionsabal, ba mhaith liom bheith leis an Teachta Ó Snodaigh ach, go praiticiúil, gan an plean seo a bheith feicthe againn agus na leasuithe ar fad a mhol mise maidir le praghas agus le scála ama curtha as ord, is é sin go gcaithfear a rá le hAire barúil cén uair a bheadh an t-aistriúchán déanta agus cén praghas a chosnódh sé, ní fhéadfainn glacadh leis an rud atá molta ag an Teachta Ó Snodaigh, ainneoin, i bprionsabal, gur smaoineamh maith é. Go praiticiúil, bheifí ag cur brú ar Airí ionstraimí reachtúla a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge agus bheadh na hAirí ag rá gur bhreá leo é a dhéanamh ach go bhfuil siad coinnithe siar ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin.</p>

          <p eId="para_268">Tuigim an méid atá á rá ag an Teachta Ó Cuív. Aontaím leis ar a lán bealaí. Pacáiste iomlán atá ins na leasuithe atá molta agamsa, ó thaobh acmhainní cuí a thabhairt do Rannóg an Aistriúcháin chun déileáil le riaráisti, le go mbeadh gach rud foilsithe go comhuaineach. Mar sin, ní bheadh riaráistí ann agus ní bheadh fadhb ag Airí amach anseo. B'fhéidir gur utopia é sin, ach is féidir le gach tír eile atá dátheangach nó trítheangach é a dhéanamh. Is féidir leis an Aontas Eorpach é a dhéanamh, pé méid teanga atá á úsáid ann. Sin an áit atáimid ag iarraidh a shroicheadh. Níl sé sroichte againn. Tá fadhbanna móra againn ó thaobh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin de.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> Níl mé i gcoinne príobháidiú sa chás seo. De ghnáth, bheinn ag rá nár chóir go gcuirfí aon rud amach ar chonradh ach go mbeadh gach rud lonnaithe i Rannóg an Aistriúcháin. Tá mé sásta, toisc an fhadhb atá ann faoi láthair, go ndéanfaí déileáil leis na riaráistí atá ann faoi láthair lasmuigh de Rannóg an Aistriúcháin. An t-aon rud atá mé ag rá ná go mbeadh an stíl céanna acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> An fhadhb atá agam anois ná nár glacadh leis na leasuithe a mhol an Teachta Ó Cuív maidir leis an bplean mór agus nach ndéanfar díospóireacht orthu. Rialaíodh as ord iad toisc go mbeadh costas ar an Stát dá mbarr. Ní costas ar an Stát atá i gceist ag na leasuithe ach déanamh cinnte de go mbeadh ár gcearta againn, mar Theachtai agus mar shaoránaigh, go mbeimís in ann cosaint a dhéanamh ar na cearta sin agus go mbeadh sé de cheart ag saoránach dul os comhair cúirte más gá agus go mbeadh reachtaíocht agus aon ionstraim reachtúil ar fáil i nGaeilge. Sin atá i gceist agam. Ní cóir go mbeadh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin ag aistriú biachlár Thithe an Oireachtais nó a leithéid. Ní sin an ról atá aige, ach bhí roimhe seo. Ní cóir go mbeadh foireann na rannóige ag aistriú fógraí, mar shampla. An príomh jab atá ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin ná déiléail le reachtaíocht. Sin mar is cóir a bheith. Ní cóir dóibh bheith ag aistriú tuairiscí bliantúla.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Nuair atá ábhar reachtúil i gceist, mura bhfuil sé cruinn foirfe, is féidir go ngearrfar costas ollmhór ar an Stát má theipeann air i gcás dlí toisc nach raibh sé foirfe, mar bhí focal in easnamh nó go raibh ciall dhifriúil ann. Ní mór an stíl cheanainn chéanna a ba chóir a bheith ann tríd síos.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_274">Is trua liom nach nglacfaidh an tAire Stáit leis an leasú. Tuigim cén fáth. An fhadhb is mó atá agam ná bhí agus tá pleananna ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin deileáil leis na riaráistí. Bhí an plean ann ó bunaíodh an Stát. Tugadh gealltanas i ndiaidh gealltanais thar na bliana go mbeadh reachtaíocht príomha ar fad ar fáil as Gaeilge. Anois agus roinnt de na leasuithe a bhímid ag súil go mbeidís os comhair na Dála, tá an gealltanas athruithe arís. Is é sin an fáth go raibh mé ag iarraidh déanamh cinnte go ndéanfar aisghairm ar an leasú ar Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla in 2011, ina bhfuil stádas difriúil ag an nGaeilge ó thaobh reachtaíochta de, nach gá go bhfoilseofar leagan Gaeilge go comhuaineach a thuilleadh mar a bhí i gceist faoin Acht roimhe sin. An tAire Dlí agus Ceart agus Comhionannais, an tAire Coimirce Sóisialaí agus an tAire Airgeadais atá freagrach as an leasú sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> Ní bheimid ag deileáil leis na leasuithe a bhaineann leis sin mar tá siad as ord toisc nach bhfuil siad gafa le príomh-théama an Bhille seo. An nóta a fuair mé maidir leis na leasuithe a chuir mé isteach i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla, nóta as Béarla, “amendment No. 21 is outside the scope of the Bill.” Tá na cinn eile as ord mar tá costas i gceist, in ainneoin gur sin an cleachtas a bhíodh ann agus ba iad na hAirí féin a rinne é a athrú díreach chun brostú a dhéanamh ar reachtaíocht a bhí ar fáil i mBéarla.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Sa chás seo, tuigim gur chóir go mbeadh solúbthacht i gceist, agus ó thaobh treoirlínte bheadh sin i gceist ar aon chaoi. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta Ó Cuív, áfach, níl seo maith go leor. Nuair a deirim go raibh éacht déanta ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin, tá éacht déanta aici ó thaobh méid foirne agus acmhainní a bhíodh inti. An fhadhb ná níor thug Tithe an Oireachtais nó an tAire Airgeadais go leor acmhainní don rannóg chun an jab a dhéanamh thar na blianta. Tá súil agam anois go bhfuil na hacmhainní ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> Tá leasuithe ann atá as ord níos déanaí a deirim iontu gur chóir go ndéanfaí deileáil leis na riaráistí laistigh de trí bliana. Sin muidne mar Theachtaí ag iarraidh deis a thabhairt don Stát bogadh go tapaidh arís.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> Rinneadh é seo cheana, rinne mé iarracht nuair a bhí Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla á phlé againn ach níor tharla sé. Fiú roimhe sin, ardaíodh an cheist seo sna cúirteanna agus tugadh gealltanais iontu go ndéanfaí a leithéid. Bhí mise sásta sprioc nua a thabhairt maidir le riaráistí nach raibh seans againn a phlé ar Chéim an Choiste, nó an plean a ba chóir a bheith ann chun deileáil leis na riaráistí. Níl a fhios agam cad é an plean nó an spriocdháta atá ag an Aire Stáit nó ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin na riaráistí Achtanna a aistriú, ní fiú ionstraimí reachtúla nó reachtaíocht thánaisteach. Táim ag caint faoi bhun-reachtaíocht atá as Béarla amháin. Ní raibh an fhadhb seo ann riamh ó thaobh reachtaíocht Ghaeilge a aistriú go Béarla.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> Tuigim cad tá á rá ag an Aire Stáit ach impím air a rá le linn na díospóireachta seo cad é an sprioc ag Tithe an Oireachtais maidir le hAchtanna as Béarla a aistriú go Gaeilge as seo amach agus maidir leis na riaráistí. B’fhéidir ansin beimid in ann teacht ar ais i gceann bliana le rá gur éirigh le Rannóg an Aistriúcháin agus tá gach rud i gceart. Is féidir linn dul chun tosaigh ar an méid atá ag tarlú faoi láthair.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">Tuigim an méid a dúirt an Teachta. Tá pleananna ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin tabhairt faoi na riaráistí. Nuair atá comhdhlúthú déanta ar fhoireann Rannóg an Aistriúcháin agus foireann an lárionaid aistriúcháin, beidh siad ag obair as lámh a chéile faoin díon amháin agus faoin stiúradh amháin agus beidh toradh níos mó ar a gcuid oibre.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> Tá sé ráite ag an rannóg gur mhaith léi é seo a dhéanamh taobh istigh de roinnt blianta. Tá sin beagáinín scaoilte ach tá sé de bhuntáiste ag an Teachta nó ag Teachtaí eile teacht isteach anseo agus ceist a chur faoin dul chun cinn atá déanta. Bheinn ag súil go mbeadh toradh dearfach le feiceáil. Tá na riaráistí ansin agus dúirt Rannóg an Aistriúcháin go bhfuil an fhoireann chun tabhairt fúthu le breis foirne ag obair le chéile. Is féidir monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar an dul chun cinn sa Dáil.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_291">In page 8, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_292">“(2F) It shall be a function of the Commission to provide clarification on An Caighdeán Oifigiúil from time to time, as it considers appropriate, in relation to questions of grammar and spelling which arise from the day-to-day work of Rannóg an Aistriúchán.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Tá an leasú seo ag dul le leasuithe 10 agus 11. Mar sin, ní dhéanfaidh mé mórán brú air. </p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Tá sé mar fheidhm ag Coimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais soiléiriú a dhéanamh ar an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil, agus déanann sé é sin. Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil an fheidhm sin luaite i reachtaíocht. Moltar sa leasú go bhféadfadh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin soiléiriú a eisiúint ó am go ham agus nach gá, mar sin, athbhreithniú iomlán a dhéanamh ar an gcaighdeán gach seacht mbliana, mar atá luaite san mBille. Mholfainn athbhreithniú iomlán a dhéanamh gach 20 bliain ar a mhéid. Má ghlacaimid leis gur sin ceann des na feidhmeanna atá ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin ní gá an obair mhór mhillteannach a bhaineann le hathbhreithniú ar chaighdeán oifigiúil a dhéanamh gach seacht mbliana.

D'fhéadfaí déileáil le roinnt mhaith des na ceisteanna a ardaítear thar na blianta. Sin ról a bhíodh ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin ach níl a fhios agam an raibh sé scríofa in aon reachtaíocht.

Ní dhéanfaidh an reachtaíocht seo athrú ar bith ar an chleachtadh sin. Sin ráite, is é an ról reachtúil a bheidh ag an gcoimisiún ná athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil gach seacht mbliana ar a laghad.

          <p eId="para_300">I move amendment No. 10:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_301">In page 8, line 28, to delete “not less than once every 7 years” and substitute “not more than once every 20 years”.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> Tá difríocht idir an méid ama a moltar i leasú a 10, an méid a mholann an Teachta Ó Cuív i leasú a 11 agus an méid atá san mBille. Seacht mbliana atá san mBille</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> Molaim gur tréimhse ró-ghairid atá san mBille. Dá mbeadh sé de dhualgas ar Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais soiléiriú a dhéanamh a am go ham, níor gá Caighdeán Oifigiúil iomlán a fhoilsiú gach seacht mbliana. Foilsíodh an leagan deireannach i 1958 agus thóg sé tamall maith é a chur le chéile. Níl a fhios agam cé mhéid duine a bhfuil a fhios acu go bhfuil an Caighdeán Oifigiúil nua ar fáil. Bhí mise ag labhairt, le déanaí, le daoine a bhíonn ag gabháil do leabhair a scríobh agus ní raibh siad ar an eolas go raibh caighdeán nua ann. Déanann siad a rud féin ar aon chaoi agus ceartaítear a saothar sula foilsítear é, ach bheadh sé áisiúil dá mbeadh níos mó eolais curtha amach mar gheall ar an gcaighdeán athbhreithnithe. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil cóip de ag gach Teachta, gur seoladh é agus go raibh tuairisc air i roinnt des na hirisí agus na nuachtáin Ghaeilge. Anuas air sin, níl a fhios agam cé mhéid poiblíocht a fuair an caighdeán, mar obair mhór teangeolaíochta sa tír.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> B'ait liom, nuair a fuair mé cóip den Chaighdeán Oifigiúil go ndúirt an príomh aistritheoir, Vivian Uíbh Eachach, go ndéanfar athbhreithniú i gcionn trí bliana a bheas bunaithe ar thuairimí an phobail. Dúirt an t-Uasal Uíbh Eachach go gcuirfeadh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin fáilte roimh tuairimí ón bpobal faoin Chaighdeán Oifigiúil athbhreithnithe agus go ndéanfar athbhreithniú dá réir. B'fhéidir go mbeadh an príomh aistritheoir ábalta déileáil le ceann des na ceisteanna a d'ardaigh an Teachta Ó Cuív níos luaithe.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> Caithfimid a bheith cúramach nuair atáimid a déileáil le Caighdeán Oifigiúil nach bhfuilimid ag déanamh siar athrú air. Tá sé go maith go nglacfadh an caighdeán le téarmaí nua, le foclaíocht nua agus le bealaí nua labhartha de réir mar a théann an domhan in aois. Tá athraithe suntasacha tar éis tarlú le 50 bliain ó thaobh an domhain de, agus tá gá go ndéantar an caighdeán a athrú dá réir. Bheadh sé mar chabhair doibh siud a bhíonn ag déileáil le reachtaíocht i nGaeilge. </p>
          <p eId="para_306"> Nuair a bhí an Bille á phlé againn ar Chéim an Choiste cuireadh an cheist cén fáth gur socraíodh ar thréimhse seacht mbliana don athbhreithniú in ionad cúig bliana, 35 bliain, nó tréimhse de réir threoir an Aire. D'fhiafraigh mé sin den Aire agus de dhaoine eile, ach b'ait leo ar fad gur socraíodh ar an tréimhse sin. D'fhiafraigh mé den Aire cén taighde a rinneadh ag an Roinn faoi dheacrachtaí a chruthódh gá le hathruithe a dhéanamh ar an gcaighdean gach seacht mbliana. D'fhiafraigh mé, chomh maith, arbh eol don Aire tíortha eile a bhfuil réimse seacht mbliana acu idir athbhreithniú ar chaighdeáin oifigiúla a dteangacha náisiúnta nó cén taighde teangeolaíochta a bhfuil seo ag brath air. De ghnáth nuair a cuirtear ceist ar Aire faightear liosta mór fada de eiseamláirí nó de shamplaí a bhfuil an cinneadh bunaithe orthu, ach ní bhfuair mé a leithéid. </p>
          <p eId="para_307">Dúirt an tAire:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_308">Tuigtear dom go bhfuil an cur chuige seo bunaithe ar dhea-chleachtas idirnáisiúnta agus gur nós é caighdeáin ghramadaí a choimeád faoi athbhreithniú leanúnach ar bhonn idirnáisiúnta. Ag an am céanna, aithnítear nach maith an nós é an iomad athruithe ó bhonn a dhéanamh ar chaighdeáin ghramadaí toisc gur gá seasmhacht a bheith ag baint lena leithéid do lucht úsáidte teangacha. Is ar mhaithe le cothromaíocht a bhaint amach a dhéantar foráil leis an mBille d'athbhreithniú tréimhsiúil an Chaighdeáin Oifigiúil.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">Níor thug an tAire Stáit liosta den "dhea-chleachtas idirnáisiúnta" seo. Níor léirigh sé an "bhonn idirnáisiúnta" atá i gceist. Rinne mé roinnt taighde idir Chéim an Choiste agus an díospóireacht seo. Ní raibh mé in ann teacht ar aon áit ina bhfuil an cleachtas seo leagtha síos ar bhonn chomh rialta agus chomh híseal le seacht mbliana. De ghnáth, bíonn ár dtraidisiúin pharlaiminte bunaithe ar an gcleachtas i Westminster. Níl aon "official English standard" ann. Ní dhéanann siad athbhreithniú mar atá déanta anseo le déanaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> Luaigh mé an <i>Académie française</i> níos luaithe. Tá ról riaracháin acu i dtaobh na Fraincise. Déanann siad cinnte de go bhfuil na caighdeáin ghramadaí agus fhoclóireachta i gceart, go bhfuil an teanga ag athrú de réir an nua-aois agus go bhfuil an Fhraincis suas chun dáta. Mar a dúirt mé níos luaithe, déanann an <i>Académie française</i> iarracht an Fhraincis a chosaint ón mBéarlachas, atá ag sleamhnú isteach in a lán teangacha timpeall an domhain. Tá sé le tabhairt faoi deara sa Ghaeilge go fóill. Bunaíodh an <i>Académie française</i> sa bhliain 1635. Déanann sé "caighdeán oifigiúil" na Fraincise a leagan amach i bhfoirm foclóra. Foilsíodh an chéad eagrán d'fhoclóir an <i>Académie</i> sa bhliain 1694 agus an eagrán is déanaí sa bhliain 1935. Tá sé ag obair ar eagrán nua faoi láthair. Tá dhá imleabhar curtha amach aige go dtí seo - ón litir A go dtí an litir E sa bhliain 1992 agus ón litir E go dtí an litir M sa bhliain 2000. Níl foclóir iomlán an lae inniu aige. Nuair atá sé sin críochnaithe aige, is léir nach mbeidh sé ag eisiúnt foclóir eile seacht mbliana ina dhiadh. Tá breis is 20 bliain caite aige ag teacht chomh fada leis an litir M. Tá fadhb mhór agam leis an cur chuige atá molta sa reachtaíocht seo. D'fhéach mé freisin ar an méid atá á dhéanamh acu sa Ghearmáin. In ainneoin go bhfuil fadhbanna acu i dtaobh caighdeán oifigiúil na Gearmáinise, ní raibh mé in ann teacht ar aon sórt athbhreithniú a tharlaíonn gach seacht mbliana. Tá an rud céanna fíor maidir leis an Iodáilis. Níl a fhios ag muintir na hIodáile cad go díreach is caighdeán oifigiúil ann. Tá níos mó ná caighdeán teanga amháin i roinnt tíortha. Den chuid is mó, is ionann an caighdeán oifigiúil agus an teanga reachtaíochta.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> Tá gach éinne anseo tar éis admháil nach bhfuil Rannóg an Aistriúcháin in ann an bundualgas atá aici faoi láthair - reachtaíocht a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge - a chomhlíonadh. Anois tá an tAire Stáit ag iarraidh cur ina luí ar an rannóg freagracht eile a ghlacadh anuas ar sin. Tá sé ag caint faoi ionstraimí reachtúla agus a leithéid de reachtaíocht thánaisteach a chur amach ar chonradh ionas go mbeidh said aistrithe lasmuigh. Mar a sheasann cúrsaí anois, níl sé ar chumas Rannóg an Aistriúcháin iad ar fad a aistriú. Cé nach bhfuil an rannóg in ann an bundualgas atá aici a chomhlíonadh, tá an tAire Stáit ag iarraidh go mbeidh sé mar dhualgas aici athbhreithniú a dhéanamh gach seacht mbliana. Tógann sé cuid mhaith ama jab mar sin a dhéanamh i gceart. Má tá sé le déanamh i gceart, ba chóir go mbeadh tréimhse mór comhairliúcháin gafa leis. Ba cheart go mbeadh na heagrais atá luaite i leasú a phléfimid ar ball gafa leis chomh maith. Ní féidir aon athbhreithniú ceart a dhéanamh ar an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil i dtréimhse gairid. Tógfaidh sé breis is bliain, b'fhéidir. An bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire Stáit go gcaillfidh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin bliain iomlán gach seacht mbliana agus an obair seo ar bun aici? De réir na reachtaíochta, beidh sé de dhualgas ar an rannóg déileáil go huile is go hiomlán leis an athbhreithniú. Beidh uirthi díriú isteach ar gach uile ghné de ghramadach na teanga, fiú muna n-athraítear na rialacha sa deireadh thiar thall. B'fhéidir go ndéarfaidh sí tar éis an athbhreithnithe go bhfuil sé foirfe. Is dóigh liom go bhfuil seacht mbliana ró-ghairid mar thréimhse.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> Níl mé buartha faoi Rannóg an Aistriúcháin. Sa deireadh thiar, is féidir léi breis oifigigh a earcú. Tá mé buartha faoin tionchar a bheidh ag an bhforáil seo ar scoláirí ollscoile, múinteoirí scoile, foilsitheoirí, iriseoirí, abhcóidí dlí, srl. Is cuma sa tsioc le ghnáthphobal na Gaeilge faoin gcaighdéan, ar go leor bealaí, mar labhróidh siad an Ghaeilge de réir na canúna nó an chleachtais atá acu. Is mar sin atá cúrsaí i ngach tír. Maireann an caighdeán oifigiúil taobh le taobh le canúintí, ar nós canúint Thír Chonaill sa tír seo. Caithfear iad a cheangailt le chéile chomh maith agus is féidir. Ní cóir bunathruithe á dhéanamh ar rialacha gramadaí ró-rialta, áfach. Os rud é go gcaithfidh daoine dul i dtaithí ar na rialacha éagsúla, ba cheart go mbeidís chomh seasmhach agus is féidir. Má tharlaíonn athbhreithniú chomh minic agus atá luaite sa reachtaíocht seo, tá dainséar ann nach mbeidh comhsheasmhacht i gceist. Má tá dabht ann, beidh sé deacair an teanga a mhúineadh i gceart. Bíonn an Caighdeán Oifigiúil á múineadh sna scoileanna. Tá seans go ndéanfaidh daoine botúin ina gcuid scrúdaithe, má thosaigh siad ag foghlaim na Gaeilge faoi chaighdeán amháin ach tháinig caighdeán eile i bhfeidhm nuair a bhíodar fós ar scoil. Tosaítear sa bhunscoil ag ceithre bliana d'aois agus caitear 14 bliana sa chóras oideachais. Dá mbeadh trí chaighdeáin i gceist sa tréimhse sin, bheadh sé an-deacair ar an scoláire agus ar an mhúinteoir. Má leanaimid ar aghaidh leis an bplean seo, b'fhéidir go mbeidh orainn cúrsa nua Gaeilge a chur ar fáil do ghach mhúinteoir. B'fhéidir gur gá é sin a eagrú pé scéal é. Ní cóir go mbeadh gramadach nua le foghlaim nó le múineadh tar éis gach athbhreithniú.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> Measaim go bhfuil moladh praiticiúil á dhéanamh agam sa leasú seo. Ba cheart go sheasfadh an Caighdeán Oifigiúil ar feadh tréimhse de 20 bliain, ar a laghad, sula mbeadh aon athbhreithniú i gceist. D'fhéadfadh an tréimshe úd bheith 30 bliain, nó 40 bliain. Molaim nár cheart athbhreithniú a dhéanamh go dtí go bhfuil 20 bliain imithe. Má éiríonn ceisteanna gramadaí idir an dá linn, ba cheart déileáil leo de réir mar a mhol mé sa leasú roimhe seo. D'fhéadfadh an rannóg soiléiriú de líne nó dhó a eisiúnt ó am go chéile, agus iad go léir a tharraingt le chéile nuair atá athbhreithniú iomlán á dhéanamh tar éis 20 bliain nó níos mó.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">Glacaim le cuid mhaith den mhéid atá ráite ag an Teachta Ó Snodaigh. Creidim go bhfuil an tréimhse de seacht mbliana ró-ghairid ar fad. Ní túisce go mbeidh caighdeán amháin i bhfeidhm le go mbeifear ag tabhairt faoi chaighdeán nua a réiteach. B'fhéidir go dtógfaidh sé dhá bhliain é seo a dhéanamh. Má tá sé i gceist ag an Aire Stáit glacadh leis an leasú a chuir mé síos, beidh dualgas air próiseas comhairliúcháin a chur ar siúl agus coiste a bhunú, srl. Mar sin, creidim gur cheart go mbeadh an tréimhse seo níos faide. Ní bheinn ag sárú leis an moladh de 20 bliain atá os comhair an Tí, ach tá tréimhse de deich mbliana molta agam ag súil le go nglactar leis mo leasú, b'fhéidir, agus go dtuigfidh an tAire Stáit go bhfuil an tréimhse de seacht mbliana ró-ghairid le tabhairt faoin gcaighdeán as an nua arís.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Tá súil agam go nglacfaidh sé leis an leasú, mar is leasa stuama é.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Bhí an dara leasú agam agus b'shin, ó tharla dhá chaighdeán a bheith sa treis faoi láthair, ceann amháin a bhfuil an foclóir bunaithe air agus ceann eile ag Tithe an Oireachtais, go mba cheart athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an gcaighdeán atá ann i láthair na huaire, as seo go ceann bliana agus go dtabharfar an coiste a bhunaíodh le chéile le Rannóg an Aistriúcháin nuair a bheifear ag déanamh athbhreithnithe ar an gcaighdeán - táim ag iarraidh go mbeidh seo mar dhualgas sa reachtaíocht - ionas go mbeidh, mar a bhí mar sprioc againn riamh, caighdeán amháin ann. B'fhéidir go n-éisteoidh an tAire Stáit linn agus go ndéarfaidh sé go bhfuil pointe againn sa mhéid atá á rá againn.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Níl fadhb agamsa más é an deich mbliana atá i gceist. Dúirt mé deich mbliana mar shíl mé go m'fhéidir nach dteastódh ón Aire Stáit bogadh ó sheacht mbliana go 20 bliain. Ach, má deireann sé anseo go dtiocfaidh sé leis an 20 bliain ach go bhfuil sé tar éis labhairt le Rannóg an Aistriúcháin agus go bhfuil sé ráite ag an rannóg go ndéanfaidh siad an céad athbhreithniú eile ar an gcaighdeán as seo go ceann bliana, bheadh lá maith oibre déanta aige. Níl aon cheist faoi dhréachtú an leasaithe, mar níl le déanamh in aon cheann ach figiúr a athrú. An rud ab fhearr ag an bpointe seo ná go ndéarfaí go raibh sé aontaithe le Rannóg an Aistriúcháin, in ionad an athbhreithniú atá i gceist acu a dhéanamh as seo go ceann trí bliana, go ndéanfar é sin as seo go ceann bliana, agus ansin go nglacfadh an tAire Stáit le ceann den dá leasú atá curtha ar aghaidh agam féin agus ag an Teachta Ó Snodaigh agus go mbeadh sé sásta glacadh leis go bhfuil an tréimshe seacht mbliana ró-ghairid agus nach bhfuil aon bhunús, ó thaithí in áit ar bith eile ar domhan, taobh thiar den fhigiúr a roghnaigh an Roinn, de seacht mbliana.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Mar an duine a thionscnaigh ag bord an Rialtais go ndéanfaí athbhreithniú ar an gcaighdeán, is dóigh liom go raibh an chéad chaighdeán lochtach sa mhéid is nár ghlac sé le cur chuige na gcanúintí éagsúla leis na briathra mar shampla. Sílim go bhfuil an caighdeán a bhí molta ag an gcoiste i bhfad níos foirfe ar an mbealach sin. </p>

          <p eId="para_319">Ar Chéim an Choiste den Bhille, seachtain ó shin, pléadh an cheist maidir le chomh minic ar cheart athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an Chaighdeán Oifigiúil agus bhí Teachtaí ag moladh go mbeadh tréimhse níos faide ná an tréimhse seacht mbliana atá leagtha síos in alt 3 den Bhille seo i gceist. Cé go n-aithním na pointí atá déanta ag na Teachtaí ar an cheist seo, ní mór do Theachtaí a nótáil nach ionann athbhreithniú a bheith déanta agus Caighdeán Oifigiúil úr a fhoilsiú.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> Mar chuid d'athbhreithniú ar an chaighdeán, bheadh sé indéanta a dheimhniú nach bhfuil aon uasdhátú le déanamh ar an gcáipéis. Tuigtear dom nach bhfuil mórán difríochta idir An Caighdeán Oifigiúil a d'fhoilsigh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin Nollaig 2012 agus an cháipéis a chuir an coiste stiúrtha faoi chúram na Roinne Ghnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta le chéile. Dá bhrí sin, is dóigh liom nach mbeidh mórán le leasú nuair a bheidh an chéad athbhreithniú eile ann i 2015. Shamhlóinn chomh maith go mbeidh níos lú arís ann tar éis an chéad athbhreithniú eile, seacht mbliana níos faide síos an bóthar agus nach mbeidh ar Rannóg an Aistriúcháin dá bharr ach deimhniú a chur ar fáil go seasann An Caighdeán Oifigiúil ar an mharthain.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> Fiú dá mbeadh cóir leasú anseo agus ansiúd le déanamh ag eascair as athbhreithniú, d'fhéadfaí iad a fhoilsiú nuair a rithfeadh an foilseachán reatha as cló, cur chuige thar a bheith coitianta nuair a bhíonn athfhoilsiú á dhéanamh ar leabhair. Tuigtear dom nach bhfuil aon deachleachtas idirnáisiúnta amháin maidir le tréimhse idir athbhreithnithe. Mar sin féin, sílim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go ndéanfar athbhreithniú ar an gcaighdeán go tréimhsiúil. Cé go bhfuil macnamh déanta agam ar na leasuithe atá molta ag na Teachtaí, táim den tuairim go bhfuil tréimhse seacht mbliana réasúnta go leor. </p>
          <p eId="para_322"> Is dóigh gurb é an rud atá i gceist againn le hathbhreithniú ná súil leanúnach a choinneáil ar conas mar atá rudaí ag athrú. Is dóigh go bhfuil sé cosúil leis L'Académie Française agus go bhfuil siadsan ag coinneáil súil leanúnach ar an gcaighdeán. Ar ndóigh, ní hionann an Ghaeilge agus teangacha cosúil leis an Bhéarla ná an Fhraincís. Tá castacht ag baint leis an Ghaeilge nach bhfuil ag baint leis na teangacha sin, castacht a théann siar go dtí aimsir na h-athbheochana. Roimh aimsear na h-athbheochana, is beag eolas a bhí ag an gnáth duine ar scríbhneoireacht na Gaeilge. Ar dtús, b'éigean dúinn an cló a athrú, an cló Gaelach go dtí an cló Rómhánach. B'éigean dúinn ansin teacht ar litriú caighdeánach agus an litriú a dhéanamh níos simplí. Tá sin déanta. </p>
          <p eId="para_323"> Ní fheicim go mbeidh caighdeán úr, nua ag teacht amach gach seacht mbliana. Ní fheicim é sin ar chor ar bith. Ach mar sin féin, sílim gur cóir go mbeadh athbhreithniú ar siúl go leanúnach, ag coinneáil súile ar rudaí agus ag féachaint an bhfuil Béarlachas nó teangacha eile ag brú isteach. Ansin, in am cuí, is cóir go gcuirfear na hathruithe, más gá, i bhfeidhm, nuair a bheidh an céad ghramadach oifigiúil eile ag teacht amach. Ní gá go dtiocfaidh sé amach gach seacht mbliana, ach is rud maith é go mbeidh daoine sa rannóg le súil a choinneáil ar ceard atá ag tarlú chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé leis an teanga. Tá a fhios againn go léir an brú atá ar an teanga, fiú amháin sna Gaeltachtaí, an dóigh a bhfuil an oiread sin tionchair ag teangacha eile uirthi.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> Sílim go bhfuil tréimhse seacht mbliana réasúnta, ach ní gá go mbeadh leabhar úr gramadaí ag teacht amach gach seacht mbliana. Ní fheicim é sin ag tarlú ar chor ar bith.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">Fós, níl freagra againn cad as a tháinig an tréimhse seacht mbliana. Dar ndóigh, is cóir go mbeadh súil leanúnach ar an teanga agus an treo atá sí ag dul. Sin an fáth go ndeirim gur ceart go mbeadh sé mar aidhm ag an coimisiún soiléiriú a dhéanamh ó am go ham. Tá sin ag tarlú cheana féin. Tá an coiste téarmaíochta ann agus tá ranna éagsúla sna hollscoileanna ag coinneáil súile ar an teanga an t-am ar fad. D'aithneodh siadsan dá mbeadh fadhb ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> Is próiseas foirmiúil atá i gceist le hathbhreithniú. Bheadh ar an rannóg córas a leanúint. Bheadh orthu suí síos agus bheadh orthu an coiste a luaitear sa Bhille níos deireanaí a chur sa tsiúl agus bheadh orthu an obair a leagaint amach go foirmiúil. I mo thuairim, ba chur amú ama é sin a dhéanamh chuile seacht mbliana. Ní teangeolaí mé agus níl an t-eolas agam i dtaobh teangacha eile timpeall an domhain. Tá beagán eolais agam i dtaobh na Gearmáinise. Réitigh na Gearmánaigh foclóir i 1901, ach níor tharla an chéad cheann eile go dtí thart ar 1926 agus ansan thart ar 1990, mar aithníonn siad nach cóir a bheith ag déanamh athruithe de shíor.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> Dúirt an tAire Stáit go raibh an Ghaeilge casta. Tá gach teanga casta agus tá rialacha difriúla gramadaí acu. San Fhionnlainn, mar shampla, tarraingíonn siad canúintí difriúla le chéile. In ainneoin gur teanga casta atá acu, ní dhéanann siad athbhreithniú gach seacht mbliana. Coinníonn siad súil ar an teanga de shíor agus tógann siad cleachtas i gceist.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">Tá caighdeán na Gaeilge ag dul i bhfad siar. Bhí Gaeilge caighdeánach ann ó thuaisceart na hAlban go deisceart na hÉireann suas go dtí Cath Chionn tSáile sa séú haois déag. Mar sin, bhí muid ar aghaidh go mór mar Ghaeil ó thaobh cúrsaí caighdeáin dhe. Tá sé spéisiúil nach bhfuil mórán eolais ar na canúintí a bhí ann ag an am sin mar bhí an scríobhneoireacht ar fad deánta de réir caighdeáin. Ba cheart go dtuigfeadh an tAire Stáit é sin. Mar is eol dó, bhí na rialacha leagtha síos ag na daoine a bhí an dualgas sin orthu. Maidir leis an gcaighdeán nua, cén fáth an bhfuil "féadfaidh" seachas "déanfaidh" sa bhforáil maidir le coiste a bhunú? Beidh an doras oscailte don rannóg breathnú ar an gcaighdeán, uisce coisricthe a chaitheamh air agus a rá go bhfuil sé thar cinn. Nuair atá an t-athbhreithniú déanta sa chaoi sin, ní bheidh ar an rannóg dul i gcomhairle le héinne nó aon choiste a bhunú - beidh athbhreithniú déanta ar an gcaighdeán. I ndáiríre, ní dhéanfaidh sé aon difríocht an seacht mbliana, trí bliana nó 20 bliain a bheidh i gceist, mar go mbeidh sé go hiomlán faoi Rannóg an Aistriúcháin a rá an ndéanfaidh siad fíor-athbhreithniú ar an gcaighdeán trí choiste a bhunú, dul i gcomhairle leis an bpobal agus cinneadh a dhéanamh maidir leis an gcóras iomlán a chur i bhfeidhm. Dá mbeadh sé i gceist ag an Aire Stáit fíor-athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an gcaighdeán ar an mbealach ceart atá leagtha amach - trí choiste a bhunú agus trí dul i gcomhairle le gach céim den phróiseas - chuirfinn comhairle air gan é a dhéanamh gach seacht mbliana mar bheadh an t-uafás oibre ag baint leis. Bheadh sé ag baint foirne ón mbunobair atá ar bun ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin; sé sin, aistriúcháin a dhéanamh. Is cuid den cur i gcéill é seo - tá an tAire Stáit sásta ligean leis go mbeidh athbhreithniú ar bun, ach i ndáiríre tá sé ag baint struchtúr ar bith don athbhreithniú tríd an focal "féadfaidh" a choinneáil sa reachtaíocht seachas an bhfocal "déanfaidh". Is seafóid an rud atá ar bun aige.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">Mar a d'admhaigh na Teachtaí, i gcomhthéacs na seacht mbliana, níl aon dea-chleachtas i dtír ar bith. Sílimid gur rud réasúnta agus seasmhach é athbhreithniú a dhéanamh gach seacht mbliana. Ní fheicim go mbeidh an oiread sin athruithe, ach b'fhéidir go mbeidh. Ní hionann athbhreithniú agus go mbeidh caighdeán úr ag teacht amach gach seacht mbliana. Coinneoimid súil ar rudaí. Ní shílim gur chóir go mbeadh orainn fanacht beagnach 60 bliain, mar a tharla idir an caighdeán a tháinig amach sa bhliain 1958 agus an caighdéan a tháinig amach anuraidh. Beidh deis ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin comhairle a fháil taobh amuigh. Beimid ag deileáil leis an gceist sin nuair a bheidh leasuithe eile á bplé againn. Mar a dúirt mé faoin tréimhse seacht mbliana, sílim gur am réasúnta atá i gceist. Níl cleachtas ar bith ag tír ar bith. Már a dúirt na Teachtaí, tá a nós féin ag gach aon tír. Sílim go bhfuil sé sin réasúnta. Mar a dúirt mé, coinneoimid súil leanúnach ar cad atá ag tarlú - an brú atá ar an teanga agus mar sin de. Mar sin, seasaim leis an méid atá sa Bhille i dtaobh seacht mbliana. Is é sin an fáth nach bhfuil fonn orm glacadh leis an leasú.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">Mar a léiríomar ar Chéim an Choiste, is é seo an príomhfhadhb atá againn leis an mBille. D'iarr mé ar an Aire Stáit samplaí den dea-chleachtas i dtíortha eile ar a bhfuil sé seo bunaithe a thabhairt dom. Tá sé tar éis a admháil nach bhfuil a leithéid ann. Ar Chéim an Choiste, níor tugadh sonraí dúinn i dtaobh treoir na dteangeolaithe a léiríonn go bhfuil sé go maith do theanga go ndéanfaí athbhreithniú bunúsach, seachas an sracfhéachaint atá luaite ag an Aire Stáit, ar rialacha gramadaí chuile seacht mbliana. Go bhfios dom, níl aon treoir den tsórt sin ag an Aire Stáit.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> Tá bealaí timpeall ar seo, mar a luaigh mé. Tá brón orm má tá mé ag caint faoin bhFraincis i gcónaí. Is teanga difriúl í an Fhraincis ar go leor slite. Tá na húdaráis sa Fhrainc, níos mó ná formhór tíortha eile na hEorpa, ag déanamh tréan-iarracht a dteanga a chosaint i gcoinne an Bhéarlachais. Mar Ghaeilgeoirí, táimid ag iarraidh ár dteanga a chosaint sa chaoi céanna. Is fadhb mhór í sin dúinn atá ag labhairt na Gaeilge go fóill agus dóibh siúd a labhróidh an teanga amach anseo. Ba cheart go mbeadh bunchoincheapa agus bungamadach na Gaeilge soiléir. Níl gramadach maith agam in aon teanga. Ní duine mór rialacha gramadaí mé. Déanaim iarracht an Ghaeilge a labhairt mar a fhoghlaim mé í, nó mar a thagann sí chugam.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> Dá mbeadh an tAire ag teacht isteach anseo le reachtaíocht ag moladh go mbunófar <i>académie</i> na Gaeilge, b'fhéidir gur smaoineamh maith a bheadh ann staidéar a dhéanamh ar na rialacha atá ag an <i>Académie française</i>, a leanas: "the primary function of the Académie will be to work, with all possible care and diligence, to give our language definite rules to make it pure, eloquent and capable of dealing with arts and science". Is é sin an bhunphrionsabal atá ag an <i>académie</i>. Níl sé leagtha síos sa Fhrainc go bhfuil ar an <i>académie</i> é sin a dhéanamh gach seacht mbliana. Déanann siad é de réir mar is gá. Ba chóir go mbeadh an córas mar sin. I gcás na Gaeilge, tá Rannóg an Aistriúcháin, atá faoi réir Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais, i gceannas an teanga reachtúil nó an Caighdeán Oifigiúil. Molaim go ndéanfar athbhreithniú tar éis 20 bliain.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> Nuair atá athbhreithniú ar siúl, mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Cuív, ba cheart suí síos leis na teangeolaithe is fearr agus na daoine a dhéanann cleachtadh maidir le reachtaíocht - Rannóg an Aistriúcháin, dream ó na cúirteanna, srl - chun na fadhbanna agus na constaicí a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge sa lá atá inniu ann a phlé. Is fiú roinnt de na ceisteanna sin a lua. Cén fáth an bhfuil sé deacair do dhaoine teacht timpeall ar rialacha gramadaí? An chóir dúinn é a athrú? An chóir go mbeadh sé foirfe? Nuair atá athbhreithniú ar siúl, déantar scrúdú den tsórt sin ar gach gné de ghramadach na Gaeilge. Sa chás seo, bheadh sé i gceist dul tríd an leabhar ó bun go barr agus, má tá fadhb ann, féachaint an bhfuil bealaí le leigheas a chur ar an scéal. Go minic, ní leigheas atá i gceist seachas stádas oifigiúil a thabhairt do rudaí atá anois mar pháirt de ghnáthchleachtas na teanga. Tarlaíonn mionathruithe canúna i gceantair difriúla de réir mar a théann an saol ar aghaidh.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> Ní rudaí ársa, a chuirtear isteach i músaem ionas gur féidir le daoine a rá go bhfuil siad go hiontach, iad an cultúr agus an teanga. Aithním go dtarlaíonnn athruithe ar an teanga mar rud beo beathach. Is é sin an fáth nach bhfuil mé ag rá nár chóir go mbeadh athbhreithniú ar an gcaighdeán riamh. Ba chóir go mbeimid in ann é sin a dhéanamh go rialta. Is dóigh liom agus leis an Teachta Ó Cuív go bhfuil cúpla bealach ar féidir é seo a dhéanamh. Is féidir leis an Aire Stáit mo leasú, nó an leasú atá curtha síos ag an Teachta Ó Cuív, a ghlacadh. B'fhearr liom dá mbeadh 20 bliain ar a laghad idir athbhreithniú amháin agus an chéad cheann eile. B'fhéidir gur cheart dúinn a rá go bhfuil sé seo de réir ordú an Aire, cé nach dtaitníonn an cur chuige sin liom de ghnáth. Más léir do Aire an lae go bhfuil fadhb éigin ann, tar éis do Rannóg an Aistriúcháin a rá go bhfuil iomarca deacrachtaí ag teacht chun solais maidir leis an gCaighdeán Oifigiúl, is féidir leis an Aire cinneadh a dhéanamh gur cheart athbhreithniú nua a dhéanamh ag an bpointe sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Don chuid is mó ní bheadh aon Aire ag gabháil d'athbhreithniú ach amháin má tá fadhbanna ann. Sa chás seo, tá an tAire Stáit ag cur ar aon Aire amach anseo agus ar Thithe an Oireachtais an t-airgead agus na hacmhainní atá curtha ar leataobh chun reachtaíocht a aistriú go Gaeilge ar fad a chaitheamh ag deileáil le hathbhreithniú. Níl sracfhéachaint ar an teanga i gceist anseo. Athbreithniú cuimsitheach teicniúil atá ann nuair a labhraímid faoin Chaighdeán Oifigiúil. Nílimid ag labhairt faoi shracfhéachaint ar alt as Gaeilge sa nuachtán le botún anseo is ansiúd. Táimid ag féachaint ní hamháin ar an nGaeilge ach ar chleachtas agus rialacha gramadaí i dtíortha eile, conas atá na teangacha eile mórthimpeall orainn ag athrú chomh maith agus an gá dúinn athrú dá réir. Sin an sórt rud atá i gceist in athbhreithniú agus is trua nach bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta éisteacht a thabhairt don leasú seo.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">Deirtear i nGaeilge go dtéann focal le gaoth agus is cinnte gur fíor sin leis an Aire Stáit seo. Chuile fhocal a deirimid anseo, imíonn sé leis an ghaoth mar ní éistíonn sé le tada. Is é an tAire Stáit gan leasú nó athrú. Is léir nach n-éistíonn sé le duine ar bith san Oireachtas seo agus nach bhfuil meas madra aige ar thuairimí mhuintir an Tí.</p>

Go bunúsach chiallódh “déanfaidh” nuair a bheadh athbreithniú ann, go gcaithfeadh coiste a bheith ann le dul i gcomhairle leis. Beidh mé ag moladh freisin i leasú Uimh. 17 go mbeidh grúpaí faoi leith ar an gcoiste sin le cinntiú go bhfuil dul i gcomhairle leathan agus ceart i gceist ann le hathbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an gcaighdeán.</p>

Ach níl aon ghá do Rannóg an Aistriúcháin suí síos le haon dream agus coiste a bhunú ar a mbeadh ionadaithe ó Fhoras na Gaeilge, ó na meáin chumarsáide, ó COGG, má tá sé ann go fóill mar táim le toil a chur go bhfuil sé d’aidhm ag an Rialtas iontach seo deireadh a chur leis an nGaeilge in Éirinn chomh sciobtha agus is féidir leis. Táim ag moladh go mbeidh ceangal ar Rannóg an Aistriúcháin agus ar Thithe an Oireachtais agus iad ag déanamh athbreithnithe ar an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil coiste comhairleach a bhunú agus comhairle a ghlacadh ón gcoiste sin.</p>

          <p eId="para_456">Aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Cuív. Tá an leasú seo réasúnta, ach go háirithe toisc gur diúltaíodh don leasú deireanach lena rabhamar ag plé.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Sa chás seo caithfimid bheith cinnte de go mbeidh coiste ar bun a bheidh ag deileáil leis na ceisteanna seo ar bhonn leanúnach. Má tharlaíonn sin, más dual don choimisiún an chuid seo den reachtaíocht a chomhlíonadh agus coiste a bhunú, bunóimid coiste cosúil leis an eiseamláir a luaigh mé sa Fhrainc agus beidh Acadamh na Gaeilge againn. Bheadh an coiste sin ag deileáil le ceisteanna teanga de shíor. Ansin, b’fhéidir nach mbeadh ualach chomh mór sin i gceist le hathbhreithniú gach seacht mbliana mar atá ann sa Bhille faoi láthair. Bheadh an caighdeán athbhreithnithe tríd an gcoiste seo. Bheadh coiste ag deileáil leis an chaighdeán agus nuair a thiocfadh an spriocdháta gach seacht mbliana, bheadh an coiste in ann a rá go mbeadh an obair déanta aige thar an seacht mbliana agus ní bheadh gá le hathbhreithniú iomlán a dhéanamh mar is iad na daoine ar an choiste na daoine is eolaí san ábhar seo. Fiú le linn tréimhse roimh an seacht mbliana, bheadh an coiste in ann dul i gcomhairle leis an ngnáthphobal ach bheadh na saineolaithe ar fad ina suí thart ar an mbord cheana féin agus taithí acu ar an ról a bheadh acu agus bheidís in ann athbhreithniú a dhéanamh réasúnta tapaidh gan chur as an ghnáth-obair a bhíonn ann do Rannóg an Aistriúcháin.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Cuív ar an leasú seo. De ghnáth nuair a impíonn an Freasúra ar Aire glacadh lena leithéid mar dhualgas trí “déanfaidh” a úsáid seachas mar rogha trí “féadfaidh” a úsáid, luaitear go mbeidh costas i gceist. Níl aon chostas i gceist anseo mar nílimid ag leagan síos aon táillí do na daoine ar an choiste nó ag cur srian ar an choiste. Nílimid chun a dhath difriúil a dhéanamh ach amháin go mbeimis cinnte de go mbeadh coiste ann ó thús deiridh.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Ní fheicim conas is féidir leis an Aire Stáit é seo a dhiúltú toisc go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh cuidiú leis sa leasú seo anuas ar an méid atá sé tar éis glacadh leis cheana féin ó thaobh seacht mbliana don athbhreithniú de. </p>

          <p eId="para_463"> Ní raibh a fhios ag éinne, ní raibh a fhios agam féin fiú nuair a bhí mé mar Aire, nuair a thionscain mé athbhreithniú ar an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil, go raibh athbhreithniú á dhéanamh ar an gCaighdeán Oifigiúil. An raibh a fhios ag éinne sa Teach seo?</p>

          <p eId="para_465"> An t-údar atá leis an leasú ná nach mbeidh an tsolúbthacht ag an rannóg dhá mhéar a thaispeáint do na daoine ar fad ar cheart ionchur a bheith acu sa Chaighdeán Oifigiúil agus neamhaird a thabhairt ar an dream atá freagrach as an gCoiste Téarmaíochta agus as an bhfoclóireacht. Tá an tAire Stáit ag rá gur féidir le Rannóg an Aistriúcháin neamhaird a thabhairt orthu.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Níor cheart go mbeadh an tsolúbthacht sin ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin. Ba cheart do Bhaill an Oireachtas a rá inniu nach mbeidh de rogha ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin ach coiste a bhunú. Tá an chumhacht ann anois, ní bheadh gá di dul i gcomhairle linn ach mura nglacann an tAire Stáit leis an leasú.</p>

          <p eId="para_467">Níl agus ní raibh aon ionchur ag mo pháirtí go dtí seo i gCoimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais toisc an tslí go bhfuil sé bunaithe i rialacha an Tí. Ní amháin sin, ach mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Cuív, níl ionchur ag gnáth-Bhaill an Tí ar ghnó Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtas. Níl sé de chead acu siúd atá ar an gcoimisiún craobhscaoileadh imeachtaí na gcruinnithe ag an gcoimisiún. Níor thug an tAire Stáit freagra cuí.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Ó thaobh solúbthachta de, an fáth go bhfuilimid sa tsáinn ina bhfuilimid faoi láthair maidir le riaráistí Achtanna atá i mBéarla amháin ná cionn is go bhfuil solúbthacht ann. Sin an fáth go raibh mise ag iarraidh spriocdháta a leagan síos agus go bhfuil mé ag tacú leis an Teachta Ó Cuív anseo, mar go mbeidh sé daingnithe. Tuigim go bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire Stáit a rá le Coimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais an coiste seo a chur ar bun ach seans go dtiocfaidh Airí eile ar nós na n-Airí a bhí ann roimhe seo nach raibh chomh báúil leis an Ghaeilge, nó nár thug tosaíocht don teanga. Is féidir le hAire mar sin é seo a fhágáil ar leataobh.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> Níl solúbthacht ag teastáil uainn sa chás seo, táimid ag iarraidh go mbeadh sé dearfach go mbeadh coiste ann chun deileáil leis an gceist seo. Is ar mhaithe an Aire Stáit agus ar son leas Rannóg an Aistriúcháin go mbeadh seo daingean agus an obair athbhreithnithe a bhaineann leis an choiste seo ar siúl de shíor nach mbeadh daoine a tharraingt le chéile trí dheifir ag deireadh sé bliana ionas go mbeidís in ann athbreithnithe a dhéanamh chun rial a leag an tAire Stáit síos a chomhlíonadh.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">Tá ballraíocht leathan ar Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais, idir an Dáil agus an Seanad. Tá ionadaíocht chothrom air sin. Ní mór cuimhneamh go bhfuil Rannóg an Aistriúcháin freagrach do Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais agus leis na treoracha a fhaigheann sí uaidh. Mar sin de, tá sé réasúnta go bhfágfar an cinneadh seo faoi Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais. Ní bheidh tionchar ag an Aire air ach beidh tionchar ag na Baill agus na páirtithe ar fad sa Teach air.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> Dúirt an Teachta Ó Snodaigh nach bhfuil ionadaíocht óna pháirtí féin ar an choimisiún ach ní bheadh a fhios aige nach mbeadh cúpla duine ó Shinn Féin air an chéad uair eile. Braitheann sin ar an phobal amuigh.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">Ní thuigim. Chuir an tAire Stáit ceangal an t-athbhreithniú a dhéanamh chuile seacht mbliana agus ní raibh fadhb ar bith aige le ceangal sa chás sin. An rud atá muid ag rá ná nach féidir athbhreithniú a dhéanamh sa lá atá inniu ann ar an chaighdeán gan tuairim na nAirí ábharacha a fháil.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> An bhfuil an tAire Stáit ag rá liom, agus cúram foclóireachta na tíre ar fad, Thuaidh agus Theas, ar Fhoras na Gaeilge, gur féidir athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge gan Fhoras na Gaeilge a bheith gafa leis ó thaobh foclóireachta de? An bhfuil sé ag rá liom gur féidir athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge gan an coiste téarmaíochta a bheith gafa leis? An bhfuil sé ag rá liom gur féidir athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge gan na meáin, ar nós TG4 agus Raidió na Gaeltachta, a bhfuil an oiread dualgas orthu Gaeilge caighdeánach a chur i láthair an phobail agus a bhfuil an oiread tábhachta ag baint le go n-úsáidfaidh na tráchtairí atá acu Gaeilge chaighdeánach, a bheith páirteach ann? An bhfuil sé ag rá liom gur féidir caighdeán a réiteach gan chomhairle a glacadh leo siúd atá freagrach as oideachas trí Ghaeilge sa tír, An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta? Ar ndóigh, tá a fhios agam céard atá i gceist. An rud atá i gceist ná leath-athbhreithniú a bheith ar bun chuile seacht mbliana agus gan dul i gcomhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Tá an tAire Stáit ag cur ceangail ar an rannóg an jab a dhéanamh ró-mhinic, ach ansin nuair a dhéanann siad é, níl sé sásta ceangal a chur orthu é a dhéanamh ceart. B'é mise mar Aire a thionscnaigh go ndéanfaí athbhreithniú ar an chaighdeán, mar a bhí an caighdeán a bhí ann le 60 bliain gan leasú ar bith déanta air ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin. Bhí sé lochtach ó thús. Bhí mírialtachtaí gan gá tugtha isteach sa teanga. Bhí meascáin canúintí sna briathra, rudaí simplí laethúla. Bhí sé mícheart, mar shampla, a rá "bheadh muid". Caithfeadh muid "bheimís " a rá, cé go n-úsáidtear "bheadh muid" sa chanúint is láidre sa tír, leagan atá i bhfad níos simplí ná an leagan táite den bhriathar.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> Níl aon mhiniú á thabhairt ag an Aire Stáit ar aon rud. Níl sé in ann aon chúis a thabhairt dáiríre seachas, "ní ceart ceangal a chur orthu". Níl sé in ann aon chúis a thabhairt, mar go mbeadh sé riachtanach go mbeadh na dreamanna seo ar fad istigh ar choiste agus nach bhfuiltear ar fad riachtanach le hathbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an chaighdeán. Níor thug sé oiread agus cúis mhaith amháin go bhféadfaí déanamh gan iad in athbhreithniú an chaighdeáin. </p>
          <p eId="para_478"> Is é an polasaí atá ag an Aire Stáit ná - an tAire gan géilleadh, an tAire gan athrú agus an tAire gan leasú. Tá sé ag déanamh mísce don Bhille.</p>

          <p eId="para_488">Leasú simplí é seo. Idir mo leasú agus ceann an Teachta Ó Cuív, séard atá i gceist againn ná go mbeidh muid cinnte, nuair a bhunófar an coiste seo - má déantar sin in aon chor anois - go mbeidh na saineolaithe seo páirteach sa choiste. Is cóir go ndéanfaidh muid cinnte de go mbeidh gach réimse dóibh siúd atá gafa le téarmaíocht na Gaeilge, reachtaíocht na Gaeilge agus gnáth cleachtas na Gaeilge ar an choiste chun a dhéanamh cinnte de go mbeidh gach rud gafa isteach in aon athbhreithniú a tharlóidh. Sa liosta atá curtha isteach agamsa, tá grúpaí breise anuas ar an méid atá luaite ag an Teachta Ó Cuív. Idir an dá leasú, tuigfidh an tAire Stáit céard atá i gceist againn. Nílim chun níos mó a rá faoi seo.</p>

Nílimid ag iarraidh srian a chur ar an méid daoine a bheidh ar an choiste ná ar aon saineolaithe eile.

          <p eId="para_491">An freagra atá agam ar sin ná go bhfuil praiseach againn agus go bhfuil mé ag iarraidh í a chur ina ceart. Nílim chun a rá sa Teach cé is cúis leis an phraiseach agus leis an oidreacht a tugadh domsa - dhá chaighdeán agus dhá dream ag déileáil leis an Ghaeilge. Ní tharlódh sé fiú amháin sa Rúis féin an lá is measa a bhí siad.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> Caithfidh mé é seo a rá. Sílim gurb iad na heagrais atá luaite ag na Teachtaí ina leasuithe na cineálacha eagras a bheidh i gceist cuidiú a thabhairt agus páirt a ghlacadh sa phróiseas, de bharr an tsaineolais atá acu ar réimse na Gaeilge. Tá sé rí-thábhachtach mar sin féin, go mbeidh discréid ag an choimisiún maidir le cinntí éagsúla a bheidh le glacadh aige. Má ghlactar leis na leasuithe seo, ní bheidh an discréid ag an choimisiún maidir le comhdhéanamh coiste a bheidh le ceapadh aige chun tabhairt faoi athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar an Chaighdeán Oifigiúil. Ní chreidim gur cur chuige ceart na moltaí seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> Luaidh Teachta an Ard-Aighne níos luaithe anseo sa díospóireacht ar maidin. Is fiú a nótáil go bhfuil an cur chuige seo ag teacht le dearcadh an Ard-Aighne nach ceart go mbeadh príomh reachtaíocht ró-shonrach agus go mbeadh an cur chuige fágtha ag an choimisiún agus ag Rannóg an Aistriúcháin. Daoine maithe iad na daoine atá luaite agus bhí daoine breátha ar an choiste stiúrtha. Tá go leor daoine ar fud na tíre, buíochas le Dia, atá cáilithe leis an obair a dhéanamh. Tá siad sna h-ollscoileanna agus in institiúdí tríú leibhéal. Casadh orm iad, daoine atá ag déanamh dochtúireachta sa Ghaeilge agus sa teanga. Tá go leor acu ann. Ba chóir go mbeadh solúbthacht le seo agus nuair a bheidh an coiste le bunú, beidh teacht ar dhaoine a bhfuil taithí, eolas agus cáilíochtaí acu. Tá go leor acu ann. Nílim ag rá nach bhfuil siad sna heagrais atá luaite, agus tá daoine taobh amuigh de na heagrais sin nach bhfuil luaite ar chor ar bith.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Tá sé éasca go leor ag duine ar bith coiste den chéad scoth a chur ar bun. Rinne an Teachta Ó Cuív féin é leis an choiste stiúrtha. Is féidir é a dhéanamh arís. Nílimid chun an rotha a athchruthú anseo. Tá daoine go leor ar fud na tire, sna h-ollscoileanna agus sna h-acadaimh a bheidh ábalta an obair a dhéanamh. Ní míorúilt ar bith a bheidh ann daoine a phiocadh amach. Mar adúirt mé, nílimid ag iarraidh ceangal na gcúig gcaol a chur ar éinne, ach go mbeidh an tsolúbthacht sin acu. Táimid ag iarraidh daoine cearta a chur air. Mar sin, ní bheidh mé ag glacadh leis an leasú seo.</p>

De réir an Bhille mar atá sé faoi láthair, is féidir leis an gcoimisiún "cibé daoine is cuí leis .... a bhfuil .... taithí oiriúnach acu, a cheapadh". Tosnaíonn mo leasú leis na focail "i measc na ndaoine ar an gcoiste". Níl srian i gceist. Nílimid ach ag rá gur cheart go mbeadh roinnt dóibh siúd ar an gcoiste. Anuas ar sin, d'fhéadfadh an coimisiún duine ar bith gur mhian leo a roghnú. Is trua é nach bhfuil an dream atá luaite agam, ar a laghad, le sonrú sa Bhille. B'fhéidir go dtiocfaidh siad. Níl mé ag rá nach dtiocfaidh siad. Is dóigh liom gur cheart tús áite a thabhairt dóibh ó thaobh an dlí de. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an liosta is fearr curtha le chéile agam, ach measaim gur chóir treoir a leagadh síos go reachtúil don choimisiún.</p>

Aithním an gá atá le cláir feasachta teanga agus cláir oiliúna teanga a fhorbairt chun go mbeidh cion níos mó d’fhoireann na seirbhíse poiblí in ann feidhmiú go héifeachtach i nGaeilge agus seirbhísí a sholáthar i nGaeilge do chustaiméirí a bhíonn á n-iarraidh. Tá sé ráite sa straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge go gceapfaidh an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe agus an tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí socruithe cuí chun cur leis an gcohórt seirbhíseach poiblí atá in ann feidhmiú go dátheangach. Bunófar na socruithe sin de réir a chéile, ag aithint na srianta atá faoi láthair ar earcaíocht chuig an earnáil phoiblí. Mar thaca leo sin, déanfar forbairt ar chóras creidiúnaithe caighdeán-bhunaithe neamhspleách d’inniúlacht Gaeilge sa tseirbhís phoiblí laistigh den chreat-oibre cáilíochtaí náisiúnta foriomlán atá ann faoi láthair. Mar a tharlaíonn sé, tá comhráití maidir leis an sprioc seo ar siúl idir oifigigh mo Roinne agus a gcuid comhghleacaithe sa Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe i láthair na huaire. Tá socruithe á ndéanamh chun gurb í an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta a bheidh freagrach as oiliúint agus trialacha inniúlachta Gaeilge a eagrú don Státseirbhís feasta. Is dul chun cinn suntasach é sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> Ní miste dom a lua go bhfuil conradh trí bliana aontaithe ag Foras na Gaeilge leis an chomhlacht Gaelchultúr chun raon de chúrsaí oiliúna a chur ar fáil don tseirbhís phoiblí. Mairfidh an conradh seo go dtí deireadh 2014. Anuas ar seo, tá glactha ag Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla leis an "scéim teanga" mar an lár-ionstraim trína sholáthrófar seirbhísí dátheangacha sa tseirbhís phoiblí. Tá sé mar sprioc sa straitéis 20 bliain chomh maith go sonróidh scéimeanna teanga amach anseo na poist laistigh d’eagraíochtaí a mbeidh cumas sa Ghaeilge riachtanach dóibh. Tá mé sásta, agus na pointí sin uilig san áireamh, go bhfuil socruithe fiúntacha idir lámha chun cumas na Gaeilge a láidriú sa tseirbhís phoiblí i gcoitinne, Coimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais san áireamh. Mar sin, níl sé ar intinn agam glacadh leis an leasú.</p>

Tá dream nua ag obair i measc foireann an Oireachtais le déanaí. Is féidir iad a fheiceáil timpeall na háite. Tá mé tar éis labhairt le cuid acu agus is daoine maithe iad. Glacaim leis gur daoine maithe iad siúd nach bhfuil mé tar éis labhairt leo go fóill. Níl cumas sa Ghaeilge acu ar fad. Cé mhéid duine eile a bheidh á n-earcú ag an gcoimisiún amach anseo nach mbeidh sé ar a gcumas acu déileáil - fiú ar an mbunleibhéal - le Comhaltaí nó leis an bpobal trí mheán na Gaeilge?</p>

Nílim a rá gur chóir go mbeadh saineolas nó líofacht iomlán ag gach uile duine sa Státchóras ó thaobh na Gaeilge de, nílim chomh míréadúil sin. Táim ag rá go gcaithfimid tosú ag pointe éigin agus is maith an rud go bhfuil an méid a luaigh an tAire Stáit ansin maidir le Gaelchultúr agus Foras na Gaeilge ó d’imigh Gaeleagras mar bhí teip ar an Stát ó thaobh státseirbhísigh de.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Má tá mé ag impí aon rud ar an Aire Stáit sé gur ceart aon deis atá ar fáil do státseirbhísigh atá ag obair anseo, ba chóir go mbeadh sé ar fáil d’fhoireann nach státseirbhísigh iad atá ar chonradh sna Tithe chomh maith.

Tá an conradh againn anois le Gaelchultúr cúrsaí a chur ar fáil do na daoine sa tseirbhís phoiblí. Bhí Gaeleagras ann ach níl sé ann le roinnt blianta anuas. Ar a laghad tá Gaelchultúr ann agus tá na scileanna agus modhanna múinte aige an-mhaith. Thug mé cuairt ar an eagraíocht sin cúpla uair. Cúpla lá ó shin, d’oscail Gaelchultúr oifig nua in aice linn ar Shráid an Chláraigh. Beidh an áit sin iontach oiriúnach, fóirsteanach, furasta do dhaoine anseo i dTithe an Oireachtais gur féidir leo freastal ar na sár-chúrsaí a chuireann siadsan ar fáil</p>

Tá rudaí ag tarlú i láthair na huaire. Tá sé thar am gur tharla rudaí mar sin agus aontaím gur chóir go mbeimis in ann ár ngnó a dhéanamh trí cibé teanga a roghnaíonn duine, fiú istigh anseo.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_635">I stated last night that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, had made his own bed, and it is not a bed of roses in the Health Service Executive, HSE. There was no need to make any promises before the last election but he made so many that he has been in a tailspin ever since trying not to fulfil them.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> We know the way the governance in the HSE was set up. There are nothing but problems in it. It is top-heavy with administration. There are many good people trying to work on the front line and in administration, but there is a lot of dead weight, inertia, unhappiness and unease. If anyone knew the HSE inside out it was the Minister because of his profession and his skills in negotiating with it in the past on behalf of his profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> This short Bill is a cop-out. There is no intention to tackle the HSE or disband it. With righteous indignation the Minister and many others in opposition were tabling parliamentary questions and getting back replies from the HSE that the matter was not one for the Minister. That is a cop-out and an abdication of powers. That is probably the reason the HSE was set up, but the Minister promised to banish all of that. He said he would deal with it, cut out the dead weight, get answers and be accountable, but what happened? We know the way he handled the board and what happened with the chief executive officer. Last week we found out, thanks to an RTE freedom of information request, how projects in my region, the south east, were fast-tracked at the expense of others because, as the Minister proclaims, the money follows the patient, but the money here is following the Ministers. They were trying to save their seats by ensuring that money was spent in their constituencies, and the CEO of the HSE, Cathal Magee, and Brian Gilroy, who was always a very good public servant, did not know anything about it. They heard this had been done before the board even met. What we are doing in this Bill is tinkering with the system, but it will not make any tangible difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> The Bill is intended to provide for a transitional measure, but that is the problem. There has been too much transition and not enough action in the HSE since 2004. The former health boards were accountable. I would love to know who drafted the Bill because it is couched in language that will continue to confuse. We will continue to have inertia and a lack of accountability in the HSE, and it will continue to be a monstrosity that is not serving the well-being of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> Accountability is referred to in the Bill, as are new posts. Separate from the Bill, but in support of the new directorate and administrative structure, the HSE has already initiated the process of putting in place the new HSE directorate management and leadership team. "Management team" and "leadership team" have become buzzwords, certainly in the past ten years, and these people are leading like sheep out of a gap. There is no vision or proper thinking on their part. We have reports from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA. As I said last night, I was very disappointed with my local hospital, which was criticised because of the levels of dirt. There is no excuse for this. They can have all the leadership and management teams they want - bed managers, ward managers and floor managers, which they never had in the past - but there is no excuse for dirt in a hospital. When matrons were in charge of our hospitals, that did not happen. I am glad HIQA found that problem because it is not fair to patients or the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> There is another issue in the hospital with patients on trolleys, the pressure of intake on the wards and the pressure the staff work under day in, day out. Front-line nursing staff, junior doctors and consultants are treating patients on beds in corridors. They should not be expected to work in those conditions. The European working time directive is being flouted in this case, yet in other areas EU directives are being implemented to the letter of the law. The staff in South Tipperary General Hospital are under too much pressure. They cannot cope with beds in corridors. They do a tremendous job for which they are constantly praised, but I blame that part of the HIQA report on a lack of resources, funding and support from the HSE nationally and regionally.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> What happened last week undermined the basis of what we are doing in the south-east region - that is, working towards a centre of excellence in Waterford Regional Hospital. The Minister of State has one in his region, and there are eight in the country. Many of us bought into that process reluctantly, but we sat down with the consultants, the nursing staff, the domestic staff, all the clinicians and the senior officials in Health Service Executive South, with whom I have had major issues and many of whom I distrust. I hate saying that, but they will tell one something in a meeting only for one to find out later that something different was done a week beforehand. That is the kind of spin that is going on. We bought into that project only to have a bombshell dropped before Christmas when Kilkenny tried to align itself with Dublin. That would undermine the basis for our centre of excellence in Waterford Regional Hospital, because we would not have the numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> The Taoiseach, in reply to my questions the other day, stated that conditions in St. Luke's General Hospital, with portakabins and so on, were appalling and that people were practically working in tin huts. That is not true. Issues arise in every hospital where portakabins and prefabs are used, but to demonise the situation in Kilkenny and Wexford - I have never been in Wexford General Hospital - is wrong. It is simple spin because the Minister was caught napping. He was caught engaging in cronyism of the worst kind, when we are dealing with people's lives. I will say no more on that, but we are awaiting a report from Professor Higgins, whom I was accused recently of maligning. I did no such thing. I merely stated that he is working out of Cork and, naturally, the more throughput he can get for that area, the better. I am sure he will do an independent report but the games being played and the brinkmanship being engaged in by the HSE are wrong. We have too many layers of management and, sadly, many of them have nothing to do but make work for pen-pushers and everyone else. We do not have the front-line staff where we need them, and this Bill will not change this.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> I refer to the new posts. The five new national directors will be responsible at national level for the delivery of services in each service domain - that is, hospitals, primary care, mental health, social care, and health and well-being. It should be all about health and well-being; we can forget about the first four. They know what they have to do. We must get value for money from the hospitals and faster throughput. If the consultants want to use the public hospitals for their private practices they should be charged for that. When I was only a ladeen I recall Barry Desmond saying he could not understand why the consultants - and many of them were eminent people - should be allowed use public hospitals and charge enormous rates while veterinarians set up their own practices, bought their own equipment and so on. That is farcical, and the Minister is one of the people who subsequently negotiated some of those packages. It was from that time that the rot set in. Public hospitals should be for public patients, and if the consultants want to operate in private hospitals, let them do so, and they should give value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> The cost of health insurance is a rip-off. This morning we heard that VHI intends to increase premiums by 6% on top of what it got earlier. People cannot keep paying those premiums, and that will put more pressure on public hospitals. The charges VHI applies are immoral. I refer to ambulance services alone. I had need of one 20 years ago when I travelled the same distance as from here to Grafton Street. I could have walked it but I did not; I needed an ambulance, for which I was charged £500. It was daylight robbery. A case was recounted to me last week in which an ambulance that arrived to take a patient from Clonmel to Waterford came from Sligo. What is going on? That is mismanagement and bungling, because it is an eight-hour journey from Clonmel to Sligo, and that ambulance may have been needed elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> We are told that all of the new positions will be above board because the Public Appointments Commission will choose the candidates. I will tell the Minister about the Public Appointments Commission. He might be aware that in the previous Government the then Minister, John Gormley, in his wisdom, set up the Inland Fisheries Board and decided that the commission would choose the candidates. There was an advertisement process and I was chair of the interview board. We arrived into the Public Appointments Commission to interview the candidates who had been short-listed. I met a lady from the commission who told us the way the process would run for the day. There were three Oireachtas Members on the board: the then Deputy Peter Kelly, the then Senator Noel Coonan and me.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">She went on to inform us that she had short-listed the candidates because it would be too hard for us. First, I wanted to have the interviews take place here on a sitting day, but they had to be held on a Monday at the Public Appointments Commission. I got an insight into what went on at these interviews. The number of former county managers and retired officials on the list was sickening. Every one of the first 20 was either a retired chief superintendent, a retired chief medical officer or another official who already had a big pension. I turned the list upside down and said we would start from the bottom up. I was looking for the candidates involved in fisheries and there were many such eminent people. We picked the three candidates and the lady involved in organising the interviews did not get her way, a point about which she was not too happy.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> This is the charade that takes place across the country, which is why the country is the way it is. It is being plundered by officialdom; there are jobs for the boys and there is cronyism. I am not referring to political cronyism but inside cronyism, with no command over officials. No Minister will take on the officials because Ministers are afraid of them. I saw it happen with the late Brian Lenihan and see it going on in the Department of Finance. The officials who got us into the mess are still there, except those who were promoted to position in the European Union. They would not even see a hole in a wall and because they are so long in the system they are suffering from fatigue. I have no faith in the Public Appointments Commission because of its shenanigans. Those involved look after themselves and their friends in high places.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> In the case I described the candidate list was filled with the names of this and that retired chief. It was as if they did not have enough in their pensions and pay-outs, while ordinary people who had applied were kept off the list. The same has happened in the case of the NewERA project in which people who applied for advertised positions did not even get a response. They are waiting for the Minister to choose, but we have seen what happened with the Minister for Justice and Equality. Their own cronies will be chosen again. If we do not break that system, we will not fix the country or sort out the mess that is the health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> To whoever drafted this legislation, it is a pious and useless document. It is only a stop-gap measure and just playing the game. It is said it is a great game played slowly, but it is too late for that. The Minister for Health promised change, but he has no intention of sorting out the health service. This holding Bill to buy more time is a farce.</p>

          <p eId="para_652">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012. Like other Deputies, I questioned previous health Ministers on the management and delivery of health services in my constituency. Of course, I got the usual reply that the Minister was not responsible but the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Health Act 2004. That Act imposed structures on the HSE which have not worked, while allowing previous health Ministers to hide behind it. There was no integration, no clarity, no direct accountability between the HSE and the Minister. It important that the HSE is accountable to the Minister, as well as to the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> The Bill is an interim measure. In the long term the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, is proposing to abolish the HSE in favour of a new system of directorates headed by a director general. This is a brave step by the Minister and will bring accountability and transparency to the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> As part of the reform of the health service, the reconfiguration of acute hospitals in the mid-west region is under way. The role of Ennis General Hospital has changed substantially. We are fortunate that a good manager took over in 2010 and under his stewardship, with a dedicated and loyal staff, the hospital has been given a new lease of life. Up to €2.5 million has been invested in the endoscopy unit. The hospital won first place in the national health care innovation awards for the provision of radiology services last year, boosting confidence in the hospital and eliminating X-ray waiting lists. A new €15 million state-of-the-art 50 bed wing has opened and it is the first health facility in the country that is SARI - strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland - compliant. I look forward to the Minister officially opening the facility in the near future. As the hospital manager has moved on, I hope the range of services he introduced will be maintained. The framework for the development of smaller hospitals will be published shortly. It will help to define the role of hospitals, including Ennis General Hospital, in the mid-west regional hospital group. I understand it will focus on enhancing and growing services rather than downgrading them. </p>
          <p eId="para_655"> In the past the Opposition sought to question the role of the local emergency centre at Ennis General Hospital, which is glaring hypocrisy in view of the track record of the previous Government. I remind the Opposition that the outgoing manager of the hospital said 90% of accident and emergency cases could still report to Ennis General Hospital, even when the new system was put in place. Every patient wants and deserves the best treatment and he or she must have confidence that if he or she needs to access this service, it will be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> Since taking office the Minister has worked hard to improve patient outcomes. He has set up the special delivery unit, made significant progress in reducing waiting times and set clear targets which the HSE has to meet. This year the HSE service plan aims to have 95% of all attendees at accident and emergency departments discharged or admitted within six hours of registration.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> According to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, there are 22 patients on trolleys at the accident and emergency department at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick. As the number of attendees at accident and emergency departments fluctuates at this time of year owing to flu etc., the current delay at the hospital is causing upset for patients, their families, as well as the nursing and medical staff. I hope the matter can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> Ireland has the 36th highest suicide rate in the world. Suicide prevention is an issue which the Government has prioritised. Today new guidelines were issued for schools in an effort to stem the problem. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is committed to transforming mental health services in line with A Vision for Change and many positive steps will be taken to improve the quality of mental health care. I concur with other Members that unused moneys allocated for health services should be diverted to plug the hole in mental health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> The Minister is driving reform which is necessary and will lead to better patient outcomes. I compliment him on his work in this regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Liam Twomey<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T14:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_660">I was a Member when the HSE was established and, at the time, we had high hopes for what it might achieve. Unfortunately, the former Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, did not have great clarity of purpose as to what she wanted the HSE to achieve. The HSE ran into several problems in subsequent years which the then Minister was able to deal with by increasing the budget by €1 billion a year. However, she never dealt with the basic problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> As a general practitioner and having worked with people in the HSE, I know there is no lack of commitment and drive at every level. This legislation will be the start of the changes we have proposed to make in the HSE. However, I am under no illusion as to what could go wrong with this and that there will be people who will try to obstruct what we are trying to do in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">This legislation adds to the picture by making the health services responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas again, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> Another important aspect of the legislation is the statutory audit committee. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. Recently, we wrote to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, with regard to ensuring that the way we in the Houses of the Oireachtas legislated for spending was realised. All too often we make a reduction to a Vote, or we direct that certain services should be reduced in health or education, but the directions are not carried out and cuts are made to some other service without the approval of the Minister or these Houses. This ends up with the public believing we are heartless and uncaring because of the cuts made by the HSE. There is a need for strengthening to an even greater extent what is planned under this legislation and the way in which the money the House has voted for is spent to ensure that if reductions are to be made in administrative sections of the HSE, then that is where the reductions will be made, rather than cuts to home help or carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> The Minister has acknowledged that this is the first step in a range of changes that will take place within the HSE. It is important that this debate is widened as much as possible because there is an absolute need for clarity with regard to what we do with the HSE. Thus far, it is crystal clear that the HSE is an organisation for the delivery of health services. If we are to change the overall mission statement of the HSE, it is important that we clearly outline what those changes will be. At issue is the administration of €15 billion which we spend on health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> Often we hear from contributors who are keen to get a soundbite. It is easy to demonise the HSE as a faceless organisation, but there are many aspects of the organisation that work well and many aspects that do not work well. For the ordinary man or woman on the street the major issues include what will happen to small hospitals, hospital groups and primary care, how to integrate the HSE with the work of general practitioners, how to genuinely look after patients in the community, how to deal with chronic care and how to set up all the associated structures. All of these questions are vital. These are the tangible questions that patients in the community understand. How to pull all of this together is relevant for the administration of the health service and how we deal with it in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> It is not possible within ten minutes to go through everything, because we must untangle some of the remarkably inefficient reforms made during the history of the HSE. The HSE is not all bad. In the beginning, because of the way the organisation was thrown together, staff did not really understand their function, and there was poor leadership coming through many levels of the organisation. This gave the sense that the whole organisation was chaotic. However, I have found that a corporate structure has begun to evolve within the HSE such as one would expect of any organisation. It is important that we keep the best parts of what has been evolving and get rid of the worst parts. There is still too much management. Many management structures were created not only within the HSE as an administrative organisation but also within hospitals and at primary care level. Many management structures were set up almost to provide a career pathway, mar dhea, for people involved in the services rather than actually providing efficient management of our health services. It will be difficult to unpick many of these superfluous layers of administration and management during the coming years without affecting front-line services, and it will require remarkable clarity of purpose not only from the Minister but from everyone who provides health services or who is involved in or has an interest in health services in the country. No one is under any illusion about how difficult this will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> I call on the Minister to clearly state, as far as he can, what is going on. A constantly changing structure without any clear plan relating to what is going on will increase the confusion and fear and this does not get people to buy into what is going on. That is what happened during the establishment of the HSE. Communication will remain vital. We must clearly outline to people what changes are coming about in the health services. Given the reductions in pay for those who work in the health services, the expected efficiencies and the reduction in staff numbers, there is, no doubt, reduced morale within the health services. There is a need to communicate at every level with people in the health services to keep people on board and working with us for the betterment of the patients we are looking after.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> It is important that not only those who are delivering health services but those who will benefit from any changes to health services are fully aware of the changes we are bringing about, and we must communicate fully with them. This will be a difficult task in the coming years. The HSE, as it was first established, went through a remarkable number of rapid changes. I recall when Professor Drumm was in charge. At the time the HSE published changes to the management structures and the various pillars it used to deliver health services in the country. The executive changed the structure so often that when we sought information from staff in Professor Drumm's office in Naas, they often provided us with an old structure which was out of date. The people there were so confused about what was taking place that they gave out-of-date information about their own organisation. Such rapid change and messing around with the system reached the point at which I could see the stagnation present at the lower, county level. People were becoming afraid to make decisions and were unsure about the type of decision they could make, which had a negative impact on health services at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> This legislation will make the HSE accountable to the people again, which is important. The changes include the setting up of a statutory audit committee, which must be robust to keep the checks and balances in place with regard to how taxpayers' money is spent in the health services. We need to communicate in a crystal clear way to everyone who requires health services and everyone who works in health services about the next steps we must take with the HSE, not only with regard to the gross administration but also with regard to everything else, including small hospitals, hospital groups and primary care. I wish the Minister the best of luck in this regard because it is a remarkably difficult task.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">I echo many of the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker, Deputy Liam Twomey. I, too, was a Member of the Oireachtas when the HSE was established. At the time of its establishment there was considerable belief among the public as well as among Members and those who worked in the health services that there was a need to overhaul the structure of governance that existed in our health system. There was a belief that the HSE would deliver successfully on the need to overhaul these services. It is fair to say, from my perspective and from that of customers or consumers of the HSE - the people and citizens who use the service - that much of the governance structure established by the HSE has not been an improvement on what went before under the old health board system. Deputy Liam Twomey referred to the old system and how, under the health boards, people were more empowered to make decisions locally. They had perhaps a better knowledge of the individual circumstances in which individual users of the health service found themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">On the establishment of the HSE, that power was removed. There was also a removal not just of oversight by the Oireachtas, but of the ability of Members to obtain information for people. The fact that public representatives deal with individual queries of constituents is much maligned but it is a reality that we are an interface between all aspects of the public service and the public. I have found the HSE structure to be most difficult to get information from for ordinary users of the health service. In fact, it is perhaps the single most positive step in the Bill that it makes the HSE accountable through the Secretary General of the Department of Health to the Minister for Health. It is a step which was committed to in advance of the last election and subsequently in the programme for Government. It is now being delivered in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> I agree with Deputy Liam Twomey about the continuous change which occurred in the early years of the HSE. Quite often, users of the service as well as staff on the front line felt that the management structures and systems which were put in place were unclear. I welcome the initiative in the legislation establishing directorates under clear headings and the creation of a direct chain of command, for want of a better term, regarding their operation. The HSE is a mammoth organisation in which approximately 100,000 people still work and has been a by-word for bad governance, politically and administratively, since its establishment. I welcome the provision in the Bill for an audit committee. It is imperative that public funds are fully accounted for when used. It is one of the great failures of the HSE as established by Deputy Micheál Martin when he was Minister that many promised savings and efficiencies were not delivered. There was quite often duplication of services across the country. Much of what was promised did not happen because of the system that was put in place in the transition between the health boards and the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> I want to make particular reference to funding for mental health, a subject to which Deputy Pat Breen referred at the conclusion of his comments. The Government has, correctly, committed to ring-fencing funding to make extra provision for mental health services. Notwithstanding the current straitened and difficult economic circumstances and the fact that his hands are tied in many respects, in particular in terms of the budget at his disposaI, I urge the Minister to ensure the funding is not only protected but actually spent on mental health services.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_675">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the legislation. One must ask what the purpose of the Bill is because it is not clear. While there has been a lot of talk about different aspects of the health service in press statements and in some of the contributions to the debate in the House last night and today, it has not specifically been about the Bill. It is important to ask why the Bill is before us today.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> There has been a lot of talk about the manner in which the HSE organises its services. I certainly do not carry a flame for the HSE and am very conscious of its shortcomings as an organisation and the flawed structure it has been. From the very start, it was clear that the body was established by people with very little understanding of how the health service worked and what its needs were. We have a huge, amorphous body with no clear lines of responsibility, no clear demarcation between service areas and a lack of transparency in its functions and as to how funding is handled. One often gets the impression that the HSE is a kind of black hole into which money disappears.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> It is very difficult to get hard information on the numbers of staff employed in different parts of the service and where exactly the funding is going. There is no doubt about the need to reform the administration of the HSE and to put in place separate directorates. While there are flaws and dangers in creating the directorates, they are necessary. There is also a need for greater clarity as to the different aspects of the HSE. Like most Members, I am concerned about that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> Legislation is not necessary to improve the organisation of the HSE. Deputy Liam Twomey made very sound points which displayed a very good understanding of the health service. All of the things he referred to could have been done by now and can be done at any stage without legislation. They concern good administration and the operational and service structures within the HSE. We should be doing those things to make the HSE much more responsive to the needs of citizens and patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> As an organisation, the HSE has two elements. It has an operational structure and a governance structure. The governance structure is the legal basis on which the organisation spends money, employs people and provides services. It is of critical importance that the HSE's governance structure is soundly based. It must be borne in mind that the HSE is the premier public body in the State. It is responsible for a budget which is larger than the combined budgets of several other Departments. It employs approximately 100,000 people and has a budget of €13 billion. It is the major public body which is why it is critical that its corporate governance structure is a proper one which adopts good practice and, from a legal perspective, is soundly based.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> It is normally the case that a public body has a chief executive and senior management team and, separately, to ensure the proper checks and balances are in place, an independent board which oversees its operations. This is the general corporate governance structure to which we are used and which is in place in most public bodies. This structure keeps the operation of a public body at arm's length from the political system which is very important to ensure we do not have political interference. It provides an assurance that there is a certain level of accountability and transparency in an organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> There is a serious corporate governance problem in the HSE as it is. The problem has arisen owing to the actions of the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, at an early stage in his ministerial career.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">We remember what happened on 28 April 2011. Where there are serious problems in the health service, a Minister will naturally look to blame somebody for those shortcomings. The difficulties in the HSE make it very easy to blame it for everything and use it as some kind of whipping boy. We remember the spectacle of the Minister marching down to the HSE in April 2011 and demanding the resignation of the board. He sacked the board, an act that could be regarded as a media stunt. He never explained why he sacked the board, which was made up of very public and well-known people who were of good standing. We are still waiting for an explanation as to why he sacked the board. That then caused the problem whereby we had a major public body with no board. The Minister had to appoint an interim board, which was a very strange board made up of seven senior people from the Department and four senior managers from the HSE. The HSE needs a proper governance structure but it was denied this because of the actions of the Minister. The HSE needs an independent board but to turn around and appoint one now would be an admission of the folly in which the Minister engaged in April 2011. In many respects, this legislation is a face-saving exercise for the Minister. This gets to the heart of what this legislation is about. It is not about reorganising the HSE or making it more responsive. It is about putting in place a corporate governance structure which the HSE does not have as a result of the Minister's action.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> What is being proposed in this legislation is that instead of a board, which most public bodies would have, the HSE is to have a directorate. This directorate will be made up of the director general and between two and six directors who will be appointed by the Minister. The director general is to be recruited in accordance with the Public Service Management Act, which is standard. It is also important to highlight the fact that the first director general can be appointed by the Minister and, of course, that is what has happened. The Minister has appointed a director general designate in advance of this legislation. I want to be clear that the point I will make in respect of that is no reflection on the present incumbent but relates to the procedures followed in this regard and the procedures provided for in this legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_684"> It is important to cast our minds back to how this situation arose and recall that on 18 July 2012 the Minister published this legislation. Section 7 proposes to insert Part 3A into the Health Act 2004. Section 16C(4) of Part 3A allows the Minister to appoint the first director general without regard to the normal recruitment procedures. There was understandable criticism of this provision when the Minister published the legislation in July. What has been given far less attention is the fact that the Minister, in seeking the approval of his Cabinet colleagues on 17 July 2012, sought and received approval for this power while withholding from them the fact that the incumbent chief executive of the HSE, Cathal Magee, had already tendered his resignation. Allowing a Minister to appoint his own man to one of the most senior public offices in the country is wrong to begin with. Allowing the Minister to provide for this in law when he failed to reveal news that was material to the content of the Bill he was presenting to his Cabinet colleagues is highly questionable. It should never have been allowed to happen and sets a very dangerous precedent. Of course, a pattern has been developing. Many of the senior people appointed by the Minister have been appointed without open competition. That applies to very senior people who were brought in under quite unorthodox employment arrangements to take up very highly paid posts and indeed other posts were created. Three new posts are provided for in this legislation where there is no clarity about the recruitment process. Again, this is a very dangerous and unhealthy system to allow from a corporate governance perspective. It is simply not following proper procedures. </p>
          <p eId="para_685"> The new governance raises significant concerns. We have a director general and directors and the number of directors depends on the whim of the Minister who can appoint between two and six directors. In respect of the corporate governance structure of our premier public body, we do not know how many directors will be appointed. The legislation provides for two, three, four, five or six in addition to the director general. All of those people are appointed by the Minister. The only real stipulation in this legislation regarding the appointment of the directors is that they will be drawn from the pool of national directors within the HSE. These are the people who are responsible as national directors for service provision. Those five posts have yet to be filled. Obviously, that provision has implications for the existing national directors with which I will deal. </p>
          <p eId="para_686"> Under this legislation, the Minister will appoint the directors. Therefore, we will have a new governance structure within the HSE and the composition of that directorate will be a director general and directors, all of whom are appointed by the Minister. I have a serious concern about this structure in respect of the circularity of the corporate governance involved, which is highly questionable. With a normal governance structure, the management team reports to the CEO and the CEO reports to the board. In the very unusual arrangement regarding the governance of the HSE, the director general is answerable to the directors in the boardroom of the HSE but when they go outside the board room, the accountability is reversed because the appointed directors are part of a management team and are answerable to their director general. It is absolutely unworkable because it is one way inside the boardroom and the reverse outside it. It is not only unworkable but unacceptable and highly unorthodox. We are told that this is only a temporary arrangement. We are talking about a significant upheaval in the governance structure and what has been said about reorganising the way in which the services are operated. Deputy Liam Twomey outlined very clearly the significant problems caused in the transition from the old health boards to the new HSE. In any major change like that in an organisation, one is talking about a four to five-year period before the thing is bedded down. The Minister is proposing to introduce major change and upheaval in the HSE and for what? For one year? When he published the Bill, he also published a number of diagrams, including this extraordinary diagram which is the timeline for the abolition of the HSE. It shows this arrow jumping from the end of 2012 to 2014 when the HSE will be abolished. Over next year the Minister is proposing to have all of this significant change take place within the HSE in order for it to be abolished at the end of that process. </p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_36">Does anybody in the Cabinet or on the Government backbenches know what will happen to the health service in 2014? What will be the delivery structure if the HSE is being abolished? It is easy to say the HSE should be abolished; we all know serious problems have arisen with it, but it is difficult to build a meaningful structure to replace it.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37"> A pattern is developing whereby in the absence of a clear vision for the health service or the structures that could deliver a responsive and fairer health system, there is scapegoating of the people working in the service. The Minister decided to abolish the board and replace it with this strange directorate. Then he sacked the CEO and put his own man in the post. Now he is proposing to abolish the HSE next year, followed by what? My real fear is that the experimentation in which the Minister is engaging in the absence of a clear roadmap for the coming few years will, in effect, dismantle the health service as we know it without providing clarity on what is to replace it. I am concerned that he is engaging in an exercise which will completely dismantle the public health service and send it into free fall.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_38"> How are primary care and hospital services to be delivered? How are the hospital groups to be constituted? Will a paid board be appointed for each of them? How will we deliver primary care services if the HSE is abolished? How are public health nurses going to function? They are the mainstay of the health service, performing the critical functions of looking after older people, supporting families and providing vaccination services. They are on the front line of the health service. Who is going to employ public health nurses or the 100,000 health workers in 2014 after the Minister abolishes the HSE? We do not have the answer to any of these questions and I firmly believe the Minister does not have the answers either.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_39"> The second purpose of the legislation is to give the Minister direct control over the operations of the health service. His role will no longer be specifically confined to policy direction but will include operational matters. This might be acceptable if the Minister's directions were to relate to principles such as setting out citizens' rights to health services or criteria for prioritising the provision of health services. We know from bitter experience, however, that neither the Minister nor his Cabinet colleagues operate on the basis of transparency and prioritisation when it comes to health spending. From a funding point of view, the €13 billion Vote for the HSE will transfer to the Department of Health next year and the HSE will no longer be answerable for that money. The Minister will have complete control over the health service and its €13 billion budget. There will be no checks and balances in ensuring proper procedures and good governance arrangements.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_40"> I oppose the Bill because, whatever about transferring powers when the Minister and the Cabinet display sound judgment and prioritise the patient in health spending, in current circumstances it would be the height of folly and highly irresponsible for the House to give these wide-ranging and unfettered powers to a Minister whose track record already concerns many of us.</summary>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_279">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_687">While listening to the previous speaker, I was reminded of the question: how does one eat an elephant? The answer is bit by bit. I am not saying the HSE is an elephant. It consists of many good people who are doing their best in an unworkable system which was handed to them on a plate several years ago. The HSE structure welded together 11 health boards which, while not without their own challenges, were working at a local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> It is important to remind the House of who presided over the change in structure. The HSE was set up by the current leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Micheál Martin, while he was Minister for Health and Children. He spent €16.8 million on reports during his four years in that office. These reports included a value for money audit which was produced in 2000 and, ironically, cost taxpayers €616,000. The absence of a real attempt to save money gave rise to the ridiculous situation where councillors from County Donegal had to attend meetings in Galway. They were eager to reflect the concerns of people in their jurisdiction, whether at primary health care level or in Letterkenny General Hospital, but became frustrated at the lack of opportunities to do so. I recall the cryptosporidium outbreak in Galway which presented a serious health concern for the people of that city. Councillors told me that they had attended meeting after meeting in Galway at which the issue was discussed. It was an important issue, but others also needed to be addressed. In stretching from Malin Head to north Tipperary, the HSE became unworkable. As all politics is local, people want to know what is happening in their own area and representatives need to reflect the issues on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> It is welcome that the Bill sets out new arrangements for the delegation of functions by the new director general. A key principle of the new structure will be that the authority will make operational decisions delegated as closely as possible to the point of service delivery. That is a welcome development. We have a plethora of people engaged in positive and proactive work, from carers to home help organisations. They need an integrated plan at a local level, with greater communication and interconnectivity among them. I welcome the sharp focus on how services can be managed and delivered at a local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> When I was on the hustings and doorsteps during the election campaign, people asked me why the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, wanted to take responsibility for health services, given that the job was a crown of thorns or a poisoned chalice. Difficulties will arise and people will get upset in bringing about change. When the Minister attempts to restructure areas of the health service, there will be turf wars and personality clashes. The reality is that human beings do not like change and change comes slowly. Two years into his term of office he has brought about change that is not really reflected in the public domain. There are positive news stories that do not get mentioned such as the reduction by 24% in the number of patients on trolleys nationally - there were 20,352 fewer patients on trolleys in 2012; a reduction of 98% in the number of adults waiting more than nine months for inpatient and day case surgery; a 95% reduction in the number of children waiting more than 20 weeks for inpatient or day case surgery; and a 99% reduction in the number waiting more than 13 weeks for routine endoscopy, to name but a few. However, that does not get mentioned because it is not good enough fodder for the media as it comes in a positive framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> I want to make reference to the work the Minister is doing on a cross-Border basis. He has built up a strong working relationship with Mr. Edwin Poots, MLA, his health colleague across the Border. I would like to compliment Mr. Poots, who - along with many of this colleagues, even in his own party, the DUP, such as Mr. Jim Wells, MLA - has a pragmatic approach to cross-Border shared services. At a time when efficiencies and cost-saving measures are introduced in the health services in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, there is a pragmatic approach to joined-up thinking in shared services.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> If we are looking at the community trust hospital model - I know the Minister is looking at different possible permutations, such as which hospitals naturally cluster together - I ask him to keep thinking on the same road in regard to reaching out across the Border. There is a natural alliance between regions such as Sligo and Letterkenny, where there are two hospitals that will form a natural cluster, but we should also be looking at <i>ad hoc</i> cross-Border relationships between Sligo, Letterkenny and Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry. There is already sharing of resources between Derry and Letterkenny, and the Irish Government has contributed €19 million to the development of a radiotherapy centre with three linear accelerators at Altnagelvin. That is an example of how we can work together mutually for the benefit of people in their respective regions. Another example of how synergies can lead to win-win situations is in regard to ambulance services. There is no reason we cannot have a shared air ambulance shared service encompassing Enniskillen, Letterkenny, Altnagelvin and Sligo.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> For counties such as Donegal and Sligo, the temptation is always to do a mapping exercise in which we look at Ireland on the basis of the Twenty-six Counties. While it is a 26-county jurisdiction from a Republic of Ireland point of view, the Minister has to continue on the road he is travelling with respect to shared services. He is already doing so in his positive and proactive engagement in regard to the children's hospital, for which I compliment him. However, he should not go down the road of being tempted by lines on a map and the way counties happen to be situated in the Twenty-six Counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> While I have the opportunity, I will reference the Higher Education Authority, which is looking at third level colleges, including institutes of technology. However, it is looking at them on a 26-county basis, which is wrong. Underpinning every policy decision we make, be it for the north-west or on a cross-Border basis, is the Good Friday Agreement, to which we all signed up nearly 15 years ago. Within that was the north-west gateway initiative, which was signed up to by both the British and Irish Governments in order to work on synergies and close co-operation between the two.</p>

          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_695">I welcome the opportunity to contribute. This important Bill seeks to abolish the board structure of the HSE and provide for a directorate to be the new governing body of the HSE in place of the board, headed by a director general; it provides for further accountability arrangements for the HSE; and it provides for related matters, including a number of technical amendments to take account of the replacement of the board structure by the directorate structure. I welcome the Minister to the House. After 14 years of seeing money thrown at a problem without addressing it, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has taken the bull by the horns and is effecting change, with a much lower budget, in the way we deliver health services in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> I come from County Roscommon. I have had to deal with the ups and downs of innuendo, of lies and of people coming out with completely mad suggestions. I will say this: shame on RTE, shame on TV3, shame on most of the radio stations and shame on the people who constantly carry on with lies in regard to what is happening in Roscommon Hospital. I want to put on the record that Roscommon town has a population of 5,000 people and County Roscommon has a population of 50,000. Where I live, in Boyle, and throughout north Roscommon, the people have always gone to the accident and emergency department in Sligo. In south Roscommon, the people have always gone to the accident and emergency department in Ballinasloe. Roscommon town has 5,000 people and a consultant at the hospital wrote to state that it could not oversee a safe accident and emergency department because the throughput was not available. We were told 14 days before a vote here a year and a half ago, by none other than Dr. Tracey Cooper of HIQA, that she could not allow an accident and emergency department in Roscommon Hospital because there was not sufficient throughput. Fewer than 30 people a day used it. They called it an accident and emergency department but it had no cardiac surgeon, nobody to intubate, no paediatric surgeon and no anaesthetist cover overnight. It is not the accident and emergency department I would expect if I were in difficulty. If a person has a serious heart attack or is in a car accident, that person will be brought to an accident and emergency department. We have now put in place an air ambulance service, based in Athlone, which is saving people's lives and which has carried out over 120 missions since it was put in place as a pilot scheme. I hope that service will be continued because it is saving lives. We also have paramedics driving about. Whereas at one time, following an accident, patients were brought to an accident and emergency department such as that at Roscommon to be stabilised and then brought somewhere else, now they are stabilised at home or at the side of the road following an accident, and are then brought to a real accident and emergency department. Lives have been saved and I want to put on record that no lives have been lost despite the innuendo and the untruths that have gone out.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> What really gets me is that on Tuesday night I saw a constituency colleague of mine on "The Vincent Browne Show" on TV3. Seven times he mentioned my name and said I did not do anything. I tell him to get down off his high horse. He should go in and see what is happening in Roscommon County Hospital and what is happening under the Minister, Deputy James Reilly. What is happening is that we are allocating resources and ensuring people's lives are saved. It is happening on the ground. Even if the newspapers and media outlets do not want to know, it behoves them to call in and see what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> Outpatient attendances for Roscommon County Hospital in 2012 were 14,855, some 2,000 more than in 2011. The number of day cases was 5,127, which was 1,400 more than in 2011. The number of inpatient discharges was 1,889, whereas the target for 2012 was 1,620. The number of urgent care centre attendances, including the minor injury care unit, was 5,940. Roscommon hospital is leading the way as an example of the role a small hospital will play. The smaller hospitals framework will set out the range of services that can be performed in smaller hospitals. If I might tell my colleague what has happened in this regard, examples of service development in the hospital this year include plastic and reconstructive surgery, led by Dr. Deirdre Jones, which commenced at the end of 2011 and is now extended to two days a week. This service is growing, with 50 patients booked for each day of the clinic - 100 patients per week - and access is significantly improving, with decreasing waiting times. Sleep studies, led by Dr. Imran Saleem, commenced in Roscommon hospital in March last year and 132 patients have already been assessed. Urology services commenced at the hospital in May. The radiology project, upgrading the X-ray system to allow doctors to view electronically and share X-rays quickly and easily, went live in August.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">This means that Roscommon Hospital can offer increased diagnostic services to patients from Roscommon who attend consultants based in Galway. In addition it means that Roscommon now provides CT scans for suitable patients on the waiting list for scans at Galway University Hospital. It is another example of how all the resources of the group are used to facilitate best patient care. An application has been made for planning permission for the endoscopy suite. This will be a €3 million development construction of which will commence in the last quarter of 2013. The unit will have JAG accreditation. Roscommon Hospital will become a centre for colorectal screening under the governance of the National Cancer Screening Service in mid-2013. It will provide a new dental service for patients with special needs while under general anaesthetic commencing in September. The nursing initiatives include nurses prescribing, X-ray prescribing, nurse-led clinics, colorectal clinical nurse specialists, Bord Altranais assessment and productive ward initiatives. The group inpatient list target has been exceeded in Roscommon Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> A few nights ago someone on "Tonight with Vincent Browne" asked "who is Frank Feighan?". Frank Feighan attends a meeting in Roscommon Hospital and in the Department of Health every week to ensure that I deliver for the people of County Roscommon but most important, to ensure that the people of Roscommon are safe. We do not have innuendo. The consultants in Roscommon Hospital wrote a letter before that famous decision to say that they could not stand over a safe service. The consultant in the hospital stated to me that the accident and emergency department was safe only if an accident occurred within a mile and a half of the hospital. In that case lives may be saved. Otherwise it was unsafe. Virtually all the doctors in Roscommon and other places sent their patients to Sligo, Galway, Dublin or Athlone. Only 9% of the people who went to hospital from Roscommon, which has a population of fewer than 50,000, went to Roscommon Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> The people and the doctors of the county drove at speed to get away from the accident and emergency department in Roscommon. Now they are shedding crocodile tears, coming out with lies and innuendo stating that it is safe and they want it. They will have a hospital of which they can be proud. It will be five times busier and twice as big but there will be no accident and emergency department because it is unsafe, not through lack of money or political will but because it cannot comply with the HIQA standard. The Opposition have talked about the money that went to hospitals in Kilkenny and Wexford. The same amount of money effectively went to Roscommon in 2004. Fianna Fáil spent €7 million on building an accident and emergency department, then set up HIQA with terms of reference that closed it down.</p>

            <p eId="para_702">Ba mhaith liom leithscéal a ghabháil leis an gcathaoirleach agus leis an Aire Stáit as bheith mall. Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, ó thráthnóna anocht ar aghaidh, ní bheidh aon chonradh ag na báid atá ag freastal ar Inis Mór, nó ar Oileáin Árann. Ciallaíonn sé sin, in ionad a bheith ag íoc €8 fillte, nó €10 mar atá á íoc ar Inis Meáin agus Inis Oírr, go mbeidh oileánaigh Inis Mór fágtha ag íoc €15 ar an turas fillte. Beidh méadú mór ar an gcostas do mhic léinn freisin. Chomh maith le sin, nuair atá conradh ann, tá smacht ag an Roinn ar rudaí ar nós caighdeán na seirbhíse, amchlár na seirbhíse agus an mbeidh an tseirbhís ann ar chor ar bith nó nach mbeidh. Tá praghas, caighdeán, clár ama agus cinnteacht faoi sheirbhis i gceist le na conarthaí seo.</p>
            <p eId="para_703"> Ó mhaidin amárach amach, ní bheidh aon chinnteacht faoi aon cheann den cheithre rud seo. Is ceist an-mhór í seo do mhuintir Inis Mór, mar gan seirbhís rialta bád agus eitleán go dtí an mórthír, níl muintir an oileáin in ann a gcuid gnóthaí a dhéanamh ná na seirbhísí a theastaíonn uathu a fháil curtha ar fáil.

An t-am seo, b'é comhairle na noileánaigh go mba cheart conradh Inis Mór a cheangail le conradh Inis Meáin agus Inis Oírr, mar a bhí déanta i dtosach báire nuair nach mbíodh ann cheana ach bád farantóireachta amháin ag tabhairt seirbhise rialta go hÁrainn.</p>
            <p eId="para_705"> Anois, an rud a rinne an tAire Stáit ná muintir Árann a fhágáil gan seirbhís faoi chonradh, gan aon chinnteacht ar chéard a tharlóidh ó sheachtain go seachtain i dtaobh seirbhísí bád go dtí an t-oileán seo. Tá sé riachtanach go dtiocfaidh an tAire Stáit ar réiteach na ceiste seo láithreach agus go mbeidh muintir Árann i dteideal na seirbhísí céanna atá ar fáil do dhaoine ar fud na tíre – seirbhís fhóirdheonaithe faoi chonradh ag an Stát.</p>
            <p eId="para_706"> Go deimhin féin, tá blianta fada ann ó chuir muid an tseirbhís seo in áit. Bhí an tseirbhís faoi chonradh in áit go dtí na hOileáin Árann i bhfad sula raibh sí ar fáil ag oileáin eile. Ach is léir go bhfuil an bun struchtúr seirbhísí a chuir an Rialtas deiridh ar fáil do na hoileáin á scriosadh agus á mhilleadh de réir a chéile agus á chur ar neamhní. </p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Dinny McGinley)<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_707">Faoi láthair tá 25 conradh ag an Roinn chuig 21 oileán. Clúdaíonn na conarthaí farantóireachta seo, paisinéirí, lastas, bus agus seirbhísí aeir agus tá soláthar €5.9m ag mo Roinn le haghaidh na cúrsaí sin. Leis na gealltanais atá ann inniu, táimid ag íoc thart ar 60% den soláthar seo ar na trí oileán Árann amháin, áit a bhfuil 43% de dhaonra na n-oileán de réir an daonáireamh. Ar ndóigh, tá an tsoláthar atá ar fáil do mo Roinnse ciorraithe go mór le cúpla bliain anuas - ar nós go leor Ranna eile - agus caithfidh mise a chinntiú go bhfuil gach oileán ag fáil cothrom na féinne agus go bhfuil mise ag fáil luach airgid ar an gcaiteachas atá i gceist anseo.</p>
            <p eId="para_708"> Mar is eol don Teach, tá deireadh ag teacht le conradh farantóireachta Árann inniu. D'fhógair mo Roinn léiriú spéise sa chonradh seo ar chóras <i>e-tenders </i>agus seoladh na cáipéisí tairisceana amach le dáta dúnta de 21 Nollaig 2012. Níor tháinig aon tairiscint ar ais chuig mo Roinn, sé sin le rá nár chuir aon chomhlacht nó aon ghnó isteach air. Bhí plé ina dhiaidh sin ag mo Roinn leis an bhfarantóir a chuireann an tseirbhís farantóireachta ar fáil d'Árainn faoi láthair, féachaint an bhféadfaí an conradh reatha a athnuachan ar na téarmaí céanna a bhí ann go dtí seo. Níor éirigh leis na cainteanna sin mar ní fhéadfadh mo Roinn glacadh le héileamh an fharantóra ardú ollmhór a cheadú sa fóirdheontas i gcás seirbhís atá, de réir cosúlachta, brabúsach cheana féin. Fiú dá mbeadh na cainteanna sin ar siúl i bhfad roimhe sin, ní fhéadfadh mo Roinn teacht ar shocrú ar na téarmaí a bhí ar fáil - mar sin, ní ghlacaim leis ar chor ar bith go raibh sé fágtha ró-dheireanach. Tuigim go mbeidh sé ar chumas an fharantóra leanúint leis an seirbhís céanna gan chúnamh Stáit, mar go bhfuil inmharthanacht tráchtála ann, agus go bhfuil i gceist aige é sin a dhéanamh.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> Maidir le cumarsáid idir muintir Árann agus mo Roinn, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil mo Roinn i gcónaí sásta bualadh le hionadaithe na n-oileán chun comhairle a ghlacadh agus eolas a roinnt. Ar ndóigh, ní féidir mianta an phobail a shásamh i gcónaí mar bíonn cúinsí éagsúla le cur san áireamh. Go deimhin bhí cruinniú ag oifígigh mo Roinne le hionadaithe phobail Árann Dé hAoine seo caite chun an scéal a mhíniú dóibh agus tuigim go raibh plé oscailte ag an gcruinniú sin faoi na dúshláin atá i gceist.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> Agus mé ag caint anseo, ba mhaith liom a rá freisin go bhfuil conradh nua aontaithe idir mo Roinn agus Aran Ferries Teo chun seirbhís farantóireachta paisinéara a chur ar fáil idir Inis Meáin/Inis Oírr agus an mórthír don tréimhse 1 Samhain 2012 go dtí 31 Deireadh Fómhair 2017. Aontaíodh an conradh seo mar thoradh ar phróiseas tairisceana. Ar éileamh ó na hoileánaigh, rinneadh iarracht na trí oileán Árann a chur le chéile ach níor éirigh leis sin mar arís ní fhéadfadh mo Roinn glacadh le hardú ollmhór ar an gcuid sin den tseirbhís a bhain le hÁrainn amháin - ardú os cionn 300% a bheadh i gceist i gcás seirbhís atá brabúsach gan aon fhóirdheontas, mar a dúirt mé cheana. Ar an dóigh céanna, tá conradh nua aontaithe mar thoradh ar phróiseas tairisceana idir mo Roinn agus an comhlacht Lasta Mara chun seirbhís lastais a chur ar fáil idir na hOileáin Árann agus an mórthír don tréimhse 1 Eanáir 2013 go 31 Nollaig 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> Sa tábla, a leanas, mar eolas don Teach, tá achoimre ar na costais a thitfidh ar mo Roinnse i 2013 i ndáil leis na seirbhísí paisinéara go hÁrainn.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">Tá súil agam go soiléiríonn an méid sin an staid reatha maidir le Árainn. Tá mo Roinn go hiomlán oscailte faoi na céad céimeanna eile. Mar shampla, bheifí breá sásta labhairt arís leis an bhfarantóir maidir leis an gconradh atá ag críochnú inniu ach i gcomhthéacs na srianta atá ráite agam cheana féin. Chomh maith céanna, beifear sásta tairiscintí a lorg arís má cheaptar go mbeidh athrú ar an scéal an babhta seo. Táimid oscailte; níl aon rud dúnta. Ar ndóigh, táimid leis an fhadhb seo a réiteach ar mhaithe leis na hoileánaigh.</p>

            <p eId="para_734">Ar an gcéad dul síos, ó na figiúirí a thug an tAire Stáit, is léir nach bhfuil i gceist anois ach €560,000 sa bhliain ar na seirbhísí seo ar fad. Tá cuma mhór ar na figiúirí mar tá cúig bliana i gceist. In aghaidh na bliana, áfach, tá ciorrú mór i gceist anseo.</p>
            <p eId="para_735"> An bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit a rá liom ar chuir sé an conradh le haghaidh an triall in Árann amach mar thairiscint amháin nach bhféadfaí a fháil mura mbeadh an conraitheoir sásta seirbhís a thabhairt don trí oileán? Má chuir sé sin isteach mar fhoráil, nach gciallódh sin nach bhféadfadh an farantóir conradh a fháil d’Inis Meáin agus Inis Oírr gan phraghas a thabhairt don trí oileán in éineacht? Sin mar a bhíodh sé á dhéanamh agam agus chinntigh sin go mbeadh margadh maith le fáil.</p>
            <p eId="para_736"> Bréagnaíonn an tAire Stáit é féin nuair a deir sé sa fhreagra nach ndéanfaidh sé aon difríocht an dtiocfadh an tairiscint níos túisce mar ag deireadh an fhreagra deir sé gur féidir tuilleadh plé a dhéanamh agus más gá is féidir dul chun tairisceana arís. An fhadhb atá ann ná nach ndéanfar roimh mhaidin amárach é mar tá an conradh thuas anocht. Dá mba rud é go raibh a fhios ag an Aire Stáit é seo ceithre mhí ó shin, d’fhéadfaí é sin a dhéanamh agus dul ar an margadh arís agus fós bheadh seirbhís ann.</p>
            <p eId="para_737"> Deir an tAire Stáit go bhfuil an tseirbhís go hÁrainn inmharthanach gan aon fhóirdheontas. Cad é an costas do na hoileánaigh? Tá an tAire Stáit ag gearradh €15 fillte ar oileánaigh le hais an €8 a bhíodh ann. Tá aon rud inmharthanach má chuirtear an táille suas sách-ard mar níl aon bhealach isteach nó amach as na hoileáin ach dul ar an mbád. An smaoineamh atá taobh thiar d’fhóirdheontais le haghaidh iompair phoiblí ná go ndéanfar cinnte go bhfuil an tseirbhís ar fáil ar phraghas réasúnach. Níl an praghas seo réasúnach, agus tá a fhios ag na hoifigigh atá in éineacht leis an Aire Stáit an obair a rinne muid ag cruthú go bhfuil costas maireachtála níos airde ar na hoileáin ná mar atá ar an mhórthír. Tá an tAire Stáit ag cur leis seo agus ag déanamh faillí iomlán ina chuid dualgas mar Aire Stáit ar a bhfuil freagracht na n-oileán.</p>

            <p eId="para_740">Bhí na tairiscintí le bheith istigh ar an 21 Nollaig, sé seachtain beagnach, sula raibh an conradh rite. Táim cinnte nach bhfuil an Teachta ag súil go mbeidh achainí den teorainn chun é seo a shocrú. Tá €5.9 milliún chun é a dhéanamh.</p>
            <p eId="para_741"> Maidir le tairiscint a chur amach leis an trí oileán le chéile, tuigim go raibh sé mar sin ag uair amháin, go raibh an trí oileán le chéile, go raibh pacáiste ann. Níl a fhios agam an raibh an Teachta féin sa Roinn ag an am nó Aire éigin eile nuair a cuireadh deireadh leis an nós sin agus nuair a briseadh síos na hoileáin agus sin an fáth go bhfuil Inis Meáin agus Inis Oírr leo féin agus oileán Árann leis féin.</p>
            <p eId="para_742"> Nílimid ag déanamh neamhaird do na hoileán. Tá an t-airgead céanna ar fáil i mbliana agus a bhí ar fáil anuraidh - €5.9 milliún. Tá mé ag déanamh mo dhíchill na seirbhísí a choinneáil chomh maith agus is féidir, na seirbhísí aeir san áireamh. Tá trí eitilt in aghaidh an lae ag dul isteach go hÁrainn, dhá eitilt in aghaidh an lae ag dul go hInis Meáin, dhá eitilt in aghaidh an lae ag dul go hInis Oírr. Tá fonn orm mar Aire Stáit na seirbhísí cuimsitheacha sin a choinneáil. Mar a dúirt mé, áfach, caithfidh mé gníomhú taobh istigh de na laincisí airgid atá orm. Tá an oiread eolais ar an Teachta ar na laincisí airgid sin. An fáth go bhfuil na laincisí airgid orm, bhí sé féin ansin nuair a cruthaíodh an fhadhb. Tá súil agam go dtuigeann sé sin.</p>
            <p eId="para_743"> Mar fhocal scoir, tá an doras oscailte agus tá oifigigh sa Roinn ag a bhfuil taithí, eolas agus cleachtadh acu ag plé leis na cúrsaí seo ar son na n-oileánach. Tá an Roinn ar fáil agus déanfaimid ár ndícheall chomh réasúnta agus is féidir an fhadhb seo a réiteach. Ní féidir linn míorúilt a dhéanamh. Caithfimid uilig a bheith réasúnta ar an dá thaobh. Tá dá thaobh ar gach scéal.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ann Phelan<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_744">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to speak on this vitally important matter. Deputy Smith and I have raised the conflict in Syria on numerous occasions. I sometimes think I am wasting my breath but at least all I can be accused of in that regard is being consistent in trying to keep the matter on the agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_745"> Earlier this week a further 65 to 70 people were slaughtered in Aleppo. This is just another grisly detail on a long list of horrific examples of the genocide being carried out there. Among those slaughtered in Aleppo were teenage boys. This seems to be a theme in Syria at present. It appears that children are being used as weapons of war in a conflict that is occurring in what was once a very highly developed society. Not only are brutal killings taking place but there appears to be a kind of perversion involved whereby the Syrian authorities seek to demonstrate, to both the outside world and their own people, just how cruel they can really be.</p>
            <p eId="para_746"> We have all heard the reports from the UN with regard to the horrors to which children have been subjected. I will not go into the details here but suffice it to say that all of the mechanisms of a normal society are being eroded on a daily basis in Syria. To date, almost 1,500 children have been killed in the conflict there. If action is not taken, there will be nothing left to fight for and the entire country will have been destroyed. What makes this matter more infuriating is that the world powers seem to have washed their hands of this conflict and are paying mere lip service in respect of the massacres which are taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_747"> The UN-Arab League mediator, Lakhdar Brahimi, has outlined the crisis in no uncertain terms to the United Nations Security Council. The latter must take responsibility for its part in this crisis. It is the Security Council's intransigence on the question of taking action in respect of the conflict that has exacerbated matters. Mr. Brahimi stated in recent days that "unprecedented levels of horror" have been perpetrated by both sides in the conflict and that "atrocious crimes" have been committed. He has been highly critical of the Security Council and has told it to get its house in order. In addition, he has stated that only the international community can now help. Was it not for the purpose of dealing with crises of this precise type that the United Nations was established in the first instance? Mr. Brahimi has urged those at the UN to set aside their differences, break the deadlock and take action to prevent the meltdown of Syrian society. The situation in Syria at present is quite similar to that which obtained in the Balkans in the 1990s.</p>
            <p eId="para_748"> There is now a real danger that surrounding nations will use Syria as a battlefield. Earlier today, there were reports of Israeli attacks on a Syrian truck convoy. Mr. Brahimi has stated that it will take real leadership on the part of world powers to broker a solution. He has warned that there will be dire consequences, not just for Syria but also for the entire Middle East region, if such a solution is not found.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_288">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_749">I agree with the points made by Deputy Ann Phelan. The escalating conflict in Syria has cost more than 60,000 lives, has driven hundreds of thousands of people out of both their homes and their country and has destroyed the livelihoods of innumerable citizens. I understand that 2 million Syrians have been displaced internally and a further 2 million require urgent humanitarian assistance. These figures alone attest to the awfulness of this situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_750"> The appalling human cost of the conflict has horrified Irish people in recent months. We have witnessed barbaric scenes of bombings and executions on our television screens. It is all too clear that the regime of President Assad has lost its legitimacy and is utterly bankrupt. The exploitation of the conflict as a proxy war by Saudi Arabia and Iran in their efforts to control the Middle East, and, at a higher level, the utter intransigence of certain UN Security Council powers - namely, Russia and China - in the context of ensuring that this problem will be addressed present a serious diplomatic difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_751"> There are three issues that need to be addressed from an Irish perspective. The first of these is the provision of immediate aid to address the humanitarian and refugee crisis in surrounding countries. I warmly welcome the Government's pledge of almost €5 million, in addition to the provision of humanitarian aid, to address the deepening crisis. It is vital that we continue to ensure our aid is targeted at those areas where it is most needed. The second issue that must be addressed relates to the need to identify the support we can provide to the rebel groups. This should be done at EU level. I appreciate that we must tread carefully in pledging support to unknown rebel groups. The Arab Spring has riled the Middle East and we have witnessed the whiplash of armed extremism in Libya. The third issue relates to the diplomatic efforts at UN level to arrive at a feasible plan to bring the civil war in Syria to a close and ensure the transition of power to democratic institutions. The European Union should use its clout to pressurise Russia and China to abandon their zero-sum approach to the awful conflict. There is too much at stake in respect of this extremely serious issue for anyone to be allowed to play politics with it.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe Costello)<recordedTime time="2013-01-31T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_753">I thank Deputies Ann Phelan and Smith for raising this issue. I agree that this is one of the most serious issues facing the entire world at present. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Tánaiste and I have all been trying to engage in respect of it as much as possible. I am pleased to be able to respond to this debate, having only just returned to Ireland a few hours ago following my attendance at the major UN pledging conference on Syria which took place in Kuwait yesterday.</p>
            <p eId="para_754"> The human cost of the brutal civil war now being waged in Syria has reached truly alarming proportions. More than 60,000 have been killed in 22 months, 2 million people have been internally displaced, a further 2 million are in need of urgent assistance and more than 700,000 refugees have fled to neighbouring countries. Given that 200,000 of the latter fled in the past two months, there is no doubt that there has been a rapid escalation in the number of people fleeing the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">The sheer savagery and inhumanity of the conflict has been well underlined in recent days, with the latest reported massacre in Aleppo.</p>
            <p eId="para_756"> Against this background, it is at least encouraging to note the generosity and also what Secretary General Ban Ki-moon described as the global solidarity, which was evident at yesterday's meeting where more than $1.5 billion, in excess of what the UN requested, was pledged to meet the urgent humanitarian requirements over the next six months. Ireland was pleased to join in this effort with the Government pledging an additional €4.7 million towards the humanitarian response in Syria and neighbouring countries. This brings our total contribution of humanitarian aid to Syria over the past year to more than €7.1 million. Ireland and its EU partners have been to the forefront in responding to the humanitarian crisis. Additional assistance announced yesterday by the European Commission and EU member states combined came to $370 million, bringing total EU assistance to date to some $830 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_757"> There is no doubt that the overall situation on the ground is deteriorating and the dangers which the conflict in Syria poses to the wider region are becoming greater. The UN and Arab League Joint Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, was characteristically candid when briefing the UN Security Council on Tuesday. He underlined the clear threat of Syria being progressively destroyed bit by bit unless the violence ends and some form of political process is initiated. The Tánaiste is attending the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels today. It will also address the situation and consider what further steps the EU can take to promote a political settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_758"> The reality remains, however, that the only viable prospect of achieving a ceasefire and initiating some form of political process leading to transition, lies in the efforts of the special representative Mr. Brahimi. It remains incumbent on all sides within Syria and indeed all countries concerned with this conflict to extend the fullest co-operation and support to Mr. Brahimi's efforts. Any other option, including further militarisation or external intervention, will simply spell total disaster for the country, at a human cost which cannot be contemplated.</p>
            <p eId="para_759"> The brutal violence and repression which the Syrian regime has inflicted upon its own people must end. We must also continue to encourage the Syrian National Coalition to develop its structures and to co-operate fully with Mr. Brahimi's efforts. The Tánaiste has already extended an invitation to the leader of the SNC, Dr. al-Khatib, to visit Dublin for discussions and to hear their plans for promoting a political settlement within Syria.</p>
            <p eId="para_760"> The conflict in Syria undoubtedly represents the most serious crisis confronting the international community at present. Ireland will continue to work with EU and international partners. We will use our influence during our current EU Presidency to ensure efforts to end the violence and to promote a political settlement receive all possible support.</p>

            <p eId="para_762">I thank the Minister of State for participating in the conference yesterday and for attending today to reply on this very important question. I trust the Tánaiste will ensure at the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting today that the EU sanctions will at least be extended beyond the end of March. It is hoped that additional sanctions will be applied. The EU high representative, Baroness Ashton, chairs the Council of Foreign Ministers. It is very important that the Tánaiste, the Minister of State and the Government ensure that some better effort is made at UN level to bring about the necessary political support. It is not acceptable that the two major powers can be so intransigent when faced with the appalling loss of human life in Syria. I hope the Government will use every available forum during the Irish Presidency to ensure that this issue is given the attention it deserves in an effort to prevent the wholesale loss of life.</p>

            <p eId="para_763">I thank the Deputies for those remarks. Yesterday I also met with the director general of UNICEF, the director general of the UN World Food Programme and with Commissioner Georgieva, to discuss how aid can be delivered and the role of non-governmental organisations. It is now easier to get essential aid into Syria. I also met Dr. al-Khatib at the Friends of Syria conference in December. He is the leader of the Syrian National Coalition. The Tánaiste and I invited him to Dublin to discuss these issues during the Irish Presidency. We hope to receive a positive response in this regard. As the Deputies said, the UN Security Council resolution is extremely important. That is the context in which the Arab League and the United Nations are moving forward with Mr. Brahimi. It is imperative for the members of the Security Council to recognise the seriousness of the situation and to cease the stand-off. I have no doubt that the sanctions will remain while the current situation continues.</p>

            <p eId="para_764">When I was a Member of the other House I had cause to lament when a Minister for the relevant Department was not in attendance to deal with my Adjournment matters. I have no argument with the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, but there are enough Ministers of State in the Department of Health to allow one of them to deal with the response to my matter which is particularly important.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">I refer to the provision of psychological services across the country, in particular, the hiring practices used by the HSE for the recruitment of psychologists. The Minister of State may have to correct me but since 2009 the HSE has imposed a block on the hiring of counselling and educational psychologists to fill positions which are filled only by clinical psychologists. This is despite the fact that the same primary degree qualification applies to all and despite the fact that everywhere in the western world both counselling and educational psychologists are hired to fill vacancies in health services. The policy of the HSE is strange given that so many psychology posts remain unfilled across the country, not least in my own part of the world. Approximately 20 posts remain unfilled. This means that the HSE is recruiting specifically clinical psychologists from other jurisdictions - from the UK in particular - while qualified psychologists with an educational or counselling background have to leave here and are hired by the NHS to do the same job in the health service of our nearest neighbour. In earlier business today the House discussed reform of the health service and new governance for the HSE. This very strange practice of recruitment is like no other in any country that I know of, and should be discontinued.</p>
            <p eId="para_766"> Sixty counselling psychologists passed a HSE interview between 2009 and 2012 and have been placed on a panel for employment, yet because of the bar that exists, they cannot be hired. Crazily, despite the fact that students on placement from college who are not fully qualified either as educational or counselling psychologists can work alongside students of clinical psychology, only clinical psychologists can be hired by the HSE because of the existing practice in the Republic. Effectively, all counselling psychologists must travel to other jurisdictions to get work. Many are working in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and in Australia, Canada and other countries. While this is happening, we are advertising overseas. We cannot get enough graduates from overseas to fill the vacancies that exist here.</p>
            <p eId="para_767"> Only approximately 70 clinical psychologists qualify annually in Ireland. Last year, there were more than 90 vacancies to be filled. As a consequence, approximately 20 vacancies remain unfilled despite the fact that the HSE held a further recruitment drive in the United Kingdom in November. We have been unable to get more than two suitably qualified people to fill the vacancies. I ask that the Department and HSE change the recruitment policy with regard to psychologists.</p>

            <p eId="para_768">I thank the Deputy for raising this Topical Issue. I apologise on behalf of the Minister, who cannot be present.</p>
            <p eId="para_769"> Psychologists perform a wide variety of roles across the health and social care services and provide a very important service to service users across a wide spectrum of need. A working group was, therefore, established within the HSE to agree appropriate eligibility criteria for the recruitment of both staff and senior psychologists to best meet the needs of service users across all areas of the public health and social care services. This working group involved principal psychologists from all parts of the HSE together with service managers and it was supported by human resource professionals. The group examined the broad spectrum of clients that the HSE serves and made a determination on which type of qualification would be appropriate for different service areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_770"> The working group decided that educational psychologists would be appropriate to work only in disability services for children. Their qualifications equip them to deal with a broad spectrum of clients within that group. They are qualified to provide services to children of all ages with an intellectual, physical or sensory disability. The HSE has established on the basis of the service requirements of different client groups and areas across the health service that the qualification of counselling psychologist equips the holder with the necessary skills to provide services to adults in the primary care and community care settings. The working group determined that clinical psychologists were eligible to work with all client groups across the health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_771"> There has been recruitment for clinical psychology posts in the mental health service recently. These posts are restricted to clinical psychologists in line with the recommendations of A Vision for Change<i>. </i> A Vision for Change sets out in great detail the role of clinical psychologist within the community mental health teams which deal with a wide range of mental health problems among adults, children and adolescents. They also form an integral part of specialist mental health teams. Since the publication of A Vision for Change<i>
							</i>in 2006, the mental health service has invested an additional €1 million per annum and dedicated 50 whole-time equivalent<i>
							</i>posts to clinical psychology training at four third-level colleges, namely, TCD, UCD, NUIG and the University of Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_772"> Thirty-four clinical psychologists graduated in 2011. The graduates are being employed to complete the community mental health teams as set out in the HSE's national service plan. In 2012, the €35 million dedicated from within the programme for Government commitment has been allocated to employ 72 clinical psychologists for general adult mental health teams, with a further 23 clinical psychologists for child and adolescent teams. Detailed plans are currently being prepared to determine how the additional €35 million for community-based mental health services will be utilised in 2013. It is expected that further clinical psychology posts will be required in 2013, as indicated in the policy in A Vision for Change.</p>
            <p eId="para_773"> The Minister is committed to the ongoing development, subject to overall resource constraints, of mental health services and to the recruitment of the most appropriate mix of health professionals to meet the varied needs of service users across the health and personal social services.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">I agree with large parts of the Minister of State's response, including in regard to the need to retain the €35 million provided under the programme for Government for mental health services in general. Perhaps I would be able to get more information on the decision of the working group if a Minister from the Department of Health were present. Why has the HSE working group on the hiring of psychologists adopted a completely different policy from the one that exists in health services everywhere else in Europe and farther afield? There are 20 psychologist vacancies, although the 60 counselling psychologists on a panel will never be allowed to fill them as a result of the criteria drawn up by the HSE working group. No similar criteria exist anywhere else. The Minister of State's answer is wholly inadequate from that perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_775"> I have dealt with an individual who was hired by the HSE as a counselling psychologist in the area of child protection prior to 2009. Now he can never even apply for vacancies that arise in that area because of the mistaken guidelines published by the HSE's working group. Vacancies remain around the country and much-needed psychological services are not provided, yet qualified psychologists must travel around the world to get work. We must advertise positions in other jurisdictions because we maintain a strict interpretation resulting in the decision that only clinical psychologists can be hired. I really do not understand how we can justify this position.</p>

            <p eId="para_776">I thank the Deputy for those additional remarks. The HSE working group comprises principal psychologists, service managers and human resource professionals. They concluded that educational psychologists would be able to operate solely in the area in which they have expertise. They agreed the same for counselling psychologists but stated clinical psychologists could work with client groups across the health service. Since the publication of the report, the Department has put in place the necessary training and educational measures for clinical psychologists to implement the policy in A Vision for Change. All the decisions that have been taken were in the context of the implementation of the current programme for Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_777">The Government's plan to sell the rights to fell and sell trees in State-owned forests puts at risk 100 years of public forestry in the country. The industry is worth €2.2 billion per year. It was worth €286 million per year in exports in 2011 and it employs 12,000 people. Despite its being an Irish success story, there appears to be a drive and determination to sell off a vital public resource that is generating income for the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_778"> Has an economic impact assessment been done of the sell-off of Coillte trees? If not, why not? The international experience is that where privatisation has occurred in countries like New Zealand and states in Australia the impact has been very negative for the public and has resulted in more private ownership, less focus on public interest and a lack of accountability in developing their public forestry.</p>
            <p eId="para_779"> It is a disaster, not just for this generation of Irish citizens but for future generations, that we would sell off the harvesting rights of our trees. It makes us an outlier in Europe. Not even in the darkest days of Thatcher's Britain was she able to sell off that country's forests yet the Government proposal is to accept the troika agreement and not challenge it. There is no legal obligation on this country to sell off the harvesting rights of our forests. What economic assessment has been done on jobs, the economy and tourism? I urge the Minister to take this opportunity to say he will reconsider and reject this ludicrous proposal.</p>

            <p eId="para_780">The plan to sell off the harvesting rights of 1.2 million acres of State forestry, the people's forests, to pay off the debts of bankers is an act of national sabotage and betrayal. Public ownership of the forests and the trees that stand on them is the birthright of Irish citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_781"> I do not know if the word "treason" has its roots in the word "trees" but to sell off the State forestry is an act of treason. What the Minister is planning to do has been done by no other country in Europe. Only one country, Sweden, sold off some of its state forestry but a few years later quickly took it back into 100% public ownership. When it was proposed they would sell off the state forests in Cameron's Britain there was a public outcry and following widespread public consultation the plans were abandoned. </p>
            <p eId="para_782"> There has been no public consultation here. That is not surprising because if there was a public consultation with the stakeholders and the people who care about our forests they would tell the Minister that privatisation puts at risk thousands of jobs, both direct and indirect, in the forestry sector, that all the valuations done so far for the State forestry lands are gross undervaluations, which suggest we will be selling off the harvesting rights for approximately €500 or less per acre when agricultural land here sells for approximately €2,000 or €3,000 per acre, and that even under Coillte forest assets are being sold to prop up the hole in the pension fund. How much more of our national forests assets will we see stripped if private for profit and commercial interests take over the State forestry?</p>
            <p eId="para_783"> Consultation would also tell the Minister that because forests take 30 to 40 years to rotate inter-generational stable stewardship is needed of the sort that we cannot have when we are talking about speculators and profiteers running the forests. They will tell him that in New Zealand, where privatisation has taken place, there have been major problems with public access, job losses and outflow of profits from the country. </p>
            <p eId="para_784"> There is simply no justification to sell our forests, and the Minister should abandon this plan immediately. At the very least he should have a public consultation where the facts of Irish forestry and what the impact of its sale would mean for this country could be discussed.</p>

            <p eId="para_785">I thank the Deputies for raising this matter and convey the apologies of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to the House. He is involved in European Union commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_786"> The examination of the sale of Coillte does not have anything to do with a drive for privatisation, the influence of Margaret Thatcher or anything to do with ideology. The assets disposal programme is a requirement of the troika which is funding the State and the Government decided that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte's forests would be examined. Further to that Government decision the National Treasury Management Agency, through its NewERA Unit, has been actively engaged with Coillte, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in recent months to examine the financial and other implications of a potential transaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_787"> Substantial work has been undertaken to date on the identification of the forestry assets involved, the determination of their value and the consideration of a number of issues associated with the proposed sale of the harvesting rights. Some of the issues identified to date include public access to recreational land, the possible impact on the timber industry, environmental and social impacts and consequential implications for the company and levels of employment. These issues, and the measures, if necessary, to address them, require detailed consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_788"> The Government is aware of the concerns expressed by a number of bodies and individuals regarding the proposed sale. Such bodies include the Timber Council of Ireland, the Coillte trade unions and environmental, sporting and recreational bodies. These concerns focus on the possible impact on the timber industry, employment levels, access to Coillte recreational forests and long-term consequences for the management of the forests, all of which form part of the ongoing consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_789"> The Government is very much aware of the important contribution Coillte makes in regard to the supply of timber to the sawmills, in the provision of forest recreational activities and valuable tourism attractions and in the maintenance of the State's forest estate.</p>
            <p eId="para_790"> The comprehensive examination process carried out to date has included engagement with potential acquirers of harvesting rights when requested by them in accordance with the published Government protocol. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and NewERA have also met with interested stakeholders to discuss their position on the sale of the harvesting rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_791"> As part of that, representatives of the two Departments and NewERA met with the Coillte group of unions last Friday where they outlined the process involved and received the view of those unions and copies of the report commissioned on the unions' behalf by Peter Bacon. It was agreed that the Bacon report titled Assessment of the Consequences of the proposed Sale of Coillte's Timber Harvesting Rights - 10 January 2013 would be analysed and a further meeting would be held. NewERA also met with representatives of the Irish Timber Council on 4 July last year to discuss the implications of any sale of Coillte felling rights on the Irish saw-milling sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_792"> The input of the various bodies such as the joint press statement of the environmental and sporting bodies, the document by the Irish Timber Council outlining its views on the proposal, the Save our Forests<i>
							</i>document published by IMPACT'S Coillte branch in November, and the Bacon report commissioned by IMPACT is appreciated as they make a valuable contribution to the consideration process.</p>

If the decision to sell off a company that is an Irish success story which is integral to this island's economic development is not an ideological decision, I do not what is because if we were serious we would develop Coillte as a publicly owned company relying on its successful past and the resources available to us as a country. It is untrue to say that this country is required to sell off the public harvesting rights on our forests.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">That is not a truthful statement. It is a public policy choice. Like me, the Minister knows this is the wrong move for this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_798">First, the idea we might be required to dispose of State assets because the troika tells us to do so makes the whole matter obscene and outrageous. That we might sell off our State forestry - our national heritage - to pay off the debts of gamblers is nothing short of obscene. The Government is not specifically required to sell off Coillte. It could find this money elsewhere by taxing the wealthy or those earning over €100,000. There are many other options but selling off the State forestry is an outrage.</p>
            <p eId="para_799"> Instead, this is an area in which we should be investing, expanding and developing to create employment. The Minister knows, as well as anyone who knows about forestry, jobs can be created just by planting more trees. Doing so would also create a sink for carbon which helps tackle climate change. It would also have a knock-on effect for other industries, services and rural areas. It is absolute madness to divest ourselves of State forestry to speculators such as Helvetica Wealth. They see our public forestry as nothing more than an opportunity to turn a quick buck, not giving a damn about public access, future investment, employment or the State's best interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_800"> The Minister must abandon these plans and we must have a serious discussion with all stakeholders about how we can develop our forestry to the benefit of all citizens and create much badly needed jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_801">I have some sympathy with the Deputies' proposition that State forests should be retained in public ownership, but not for the overly emotive reasons they advanced. I am interested in exploring the possibilities of synergies between Coillte and Bord na Móna in creating a bioenergy company, for example. It has nothing to do, however, with the fact that Coillte is profitable. Bord Gáis Éireann's energy division is profitable and will be put on the market as a result of the requirements of the programme with the troika which are very explicit that there must be an asset disposal programme. If the Deputies want to exclude the harvesting rights in Coillte, perhaps then they will list for me which companies they would like to see included in the asset disposal programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_802"> It is a fact that such a programme is required by the only lender that the State has. It is not a question of ideology, privatisation or lust on someone's part in government to want to sell the harvesting rights. It is an attempt to comply with strictures laid down by the troika. We have made some progress in respect of these because 50% of the proceeds of whatever is sold will be made available for re-investment and job creation.</p>

            <p eId="para_815">An Post is a commercial State body with its own board and management. Accordingly, operational matters are a matter for the board and management. These are areas in which I have no statutory function. As shareholder, however, I do have a strong concern about the ongoing commercial position of the company and I regularly liaise with the company in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_816"> The reality is the core mail business of An Post has suffered a major fall which has impacted seriously on the company’s revenue flow. In response, it is proactively seeking to keep costs down and diversify its business. Control of costs must, in particular, be rigorously pursued by the company in light of the continuing drain on revenue arising from the core mail business decline.</p>
            <p eId="para_817"> None the less, it is my strong objective that An Post remains a strong and viable State company, providing high quality services on a nationwide basis through a network of economically viable post offices. This objective is shared on all sides of the House. I must stress, however, that the company requires to be in a sustainable and viable financial position to ensure this. An Post is a commercial State company and its strategy and decision making must be formulated in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_818"> However, I firmly believe An Post has many strengths. It is a trusted brand and it also has the largest retail presence in the country. I have impressed on the company the need to exploit further its unique position in this regard. I have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.</p>
            <p eId="para_819"> I welcome the progress An Post has made towards diversification, including the announcement that following the decision of AIB to close several branches, an extended range of AIB services is available through post offices in the locality of the closures. This is beneficial not only to An Post as a commercial body but also to the local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">

            </p>
            <p eId="para_821">Furthermore, in May last year I welcomed the arrangement between An Post One Direct and Aviva which saw 23 Aviva insurance branches become One Direct outlets. This not only secured some of the jobs that were at risk due to Aviva's restructuring but it further broadened An Post's portfolio of financial services offering to customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_822"> In the context of the public sector reform and service delivery agenda, I continue to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and other Ministers in relation to consideration, as appropriate, of the post office network for transactional elements of the business of Departments and Government agencies. I have stressed to my Government colleagues that the network is ideally configured for over the counter transactions. I and my Department will maintain ongoing contact with the board and management of the company to work with them on our shared objectives in light of the challenging environment which they face.</p>

            <p eId="para_823">I accept the independence of An Post but for generations there has been an ongoing debate about the survival and maintenance of rural post offices. It is tied in with other issues such as rural isolation. We may have ghost estates but we also have ghost villages. Communities are losing their post offices not just in rural areas but in urban areas as was seen in Blackpool in Cork city recently. Since I was elected, every communications Minister has said they want to provide a network of commercially viable post offices. In his reply, the Minister stated An Post should seek further contracts. However, we do not see any urgency in this regard. We have heard at public meetings and so forth that An Post should go into providing different services such as county council bills, but there never seems to be an urgency for it to go after these contracts. There must be a drive to ensure the post office network becomes a provider of other services.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">There must be an urgency because many of the smaller post offices rely almost exclusively on social welfare business at this stage and they need to become more than simply a traditional post office. Perhaps in his negotiations the Minister could encourage An Post to have a sense of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_825">I agree that as a result of the collapse of the core business of An Post there needs to be an urgency, as Deputy Moynihan puts it, in terms of acquiring new business and diversification and so on. In fairness to An Post, it has been going about its business quietly and in a commercial manner and it continues to do so. For example, there is an arrangement between An Post, One Direct and Aviva, which has seen 23 Aviva insurance branches become One Direct outlets for An Post. This is the type of venture that could be built on because An Post has a unique retail infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_826"> Deputy Moynihan offered an exhortation to urgency but even if An Post was unsuccessful in all other cases, it has been chasing contracts and opportunities, including motor tax renewals, driving license renewals, HSE patient charges, household charge payments, second home payments, water charge payments, Courts Service fines, the registration and payment for septic tanks, Irish Rail ticket sales and electrical rural production. An Post chases all of this business and it wins more than its fair share. These are the types of contracts that represent the future of part of the business of An Post.</p>

            <p eId="para_827">The Water Services Bill will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas next week and will be debated at length. We should show good faith and show that we are all serious about the provision and maintenance of the post offices. There is a fear in rural communities in particular and in urban communities that they are awaiting the retirement of the postmaster or postmistress. Something should be included in the legislation to the effect that the first port of call for the payment of bills that accrue from the Water Services Bill should be the post office. The same should apply to any other legislation coming through to ensure that An Post and the post office network is highlighted as the first port of call and the point of interaction between the citizen and the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_828">I accept the importance of the network of An Post, not least in rural Ireland, and I accept that it is a trusted brand. It is also a commercial State company, though, and must compete commercially and it is focused on doing precisely that. The State contracts to which Deputy Moynihan refers are those which An Post ought to compete for and for which it should have at least a 50-50 prospect of success.</p>

            <p eId="para_830">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for developing planning policy and legislation. Extensive public consultation rights are enshrined and protected under Irish planning law. These apply not only to wind energy developments but to all forms of development that require planning permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_831"> The Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and other Energy Infrastructure, published in July last year, recognises the need for and urgency of new energy infrastructure. It notes that the planning process provides the necessary framework for ensuring that all necessary standards are met and that consultation is built into the process. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government issued guidelines on wind energy development in 2006 and these are available on that Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_832"> When carrying out forward planning and development management functions, planning authorities are required to have regard to guidelines issued by the Department. The guidelines are also intended to ensure a consistency of approach throughout the country in the identification of suitable locations for wind energy development and the treatment of planning applications for wind energy developments. This mapping of suitable locations is carried out through the development plan process, which makes extensive statutory provision for public consultation. In addition, the guidelines also provide advice on best practice with regard to public consultation in advance of the lodgement of a planning application for a wind energy development.</p>
            <p eId="para_833"> The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, in conjunction with my Department, is undertaking a technical update of the guidance on certain aspects of the wind energy development guidelines and the advertisement on the consultation was in the newspapers yesterday. The update is intended to ensure that the wind energy guidelines are supported by a robust and up-to-date evidence base on these issues and to support wind energy development in a manner that safeguards residential amenity, consistent with EU and national policy. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government issued a press notice in this regard yesterday.</p>

            <p eId="para_834">I thank the Minister for the reply. I have spoken with people who live adjacent to turbines and I believe they cause many problems for the people concerned. By its nature, a memorandum of understanding is a high-level document and does not go into detail. People are keen to see an overall strategy in place and that detailed economic, social and job creation assessments are done with reference to the people living in the vicinity. I read an article in which someone was quoted as referring to 400 workers. There may indeed be 400 workers but it is possible that not one of those will come from the jobless list. We need some social dividend clause in whatever is eventually agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_835"> Will we be doing more than simply an environmental impact assessment? Will we do an economic assessment, a social assessment and an assessment of the impact on people living in the vicinity? Will any of these assessments come to the Oireachtas committee before a final contract is signed?</p>

            <p eId="para_836">The answer to all of the questions concerning what went into the examination being done about the development of wind energy is "Yes". Deputy Colreavy's concluding point specifically referred to the memorandum of understanding I signed last week with the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. I would be more than pleased to appear before the Oireachtas committee whenever the members wish to arrange it.</p>
            <p eId="para_837"> I have stayed away from the jobs potential, but it is significant. Some of the developers who are preparing projects and involved in the planning arrangements and the acquisition of land and so on have put figures on the jobs potential, but I am not keen to be dragged down that road nor do I wish to be dragged down the road of being partisan in terms of any particular developer. Anyway, there is significant potential for jobs not least in the construction area and that is potentially significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_838"> Deputy Colreavy made a point about the economics of wind energy. The answer cannot omit to take into account that as part of the thrust of the policy, which is to de-carbonise our energy systems, the build up of our renewable capacity is essential. If we are to meet our mandatory and ambitious targets for renewable energy, which aim for 40% generation by renewable energy sources by 2020, as agreed with EU member states, then we must build out our renewable capacity. We are fortunate to have particularly propitious wind resources. It is the exploitation of an indigenous resource that will create jobs on the island and create wealth and that is to be welcomed.</p>

            <p eId="para_839">Everyone agrees with the Minister in that sense. While we want, of course, to reduce the impact by increasing the use of renewable energy, we must ensure we get the best possible deal when we export energy to another nation. It is in that context that the economic impact assessment comes in. The economic impact of taking people off the unemployment queues must also be taken into account. If that work is done with the greater involvement of the joint committee, decisions will be better informed. It is also the case that if there is proper public consultation, particularly with people living in the vicinity of any installations, better planning and construction decisions will be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_840">I agree broadly with what the Deputy says. I have read some incredible nonsense since the memorandum of understanding was agreed. Some of the commentary has been trite and uninformed. Some of the commentary from outside the State has been very odd. In fact, the deal has the potential to be a win-win for Britain and Ireland. I am interested in what Ireland Inc. gets from the deal, whose potential in terms of jobs, exploitation of unique indigenous resources and wealth creation is significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_841"> I cannot understand the commentary that the terms favour Britain. There are no terms in the memorandum of understanding, which is facilitative of the significant projects that private developers have assembled. They cannot trade with the neighbouring island unless that trade is facilitated by an intergovernmental agreement. I do not know how people can purport to make the kinds of comment I have read on the economic terms when they are not there yet. It is simply untrue to state that we will have wind turbines at every crossroads in Ireland. That is not happening and will not happen. I regret greatly that these things are being misrepresented.</p>

            <p eId="para_843">The commercial and technical operations of the east-west interconnector are an operational matter for EirGrid, which is a commercial State company. I have no role or function in that regard. EirGrid is the independent statutory body responsible for the development and maintenance of the national electricity transmission system. As with any major complex project using purpose-built technology, the east-west interconnector requires comprehensive testing. <i>
							</i>Tests during autumn 2012 highlighted certain issues relating to localised incidents of noise interference with telephone lines. I understand from EirGrid that the company and its contractor co-operated with telecommunications network providers to address the reported telephone noise interference. The commencement of commercial trading over the interconnector was deferred until such time as the localised issues were resolved. I emphasise that the issue relates to noise on some telephone lines in the vicinity of the interconnector and is not a health concern. Testing has confirmed that the interconnector is operating well within international standards on electric and magnetic fields.</p>
            <p eId="para_844"> EirGrid has confirmed that the interconnector has been running continuously since 1 December 2012 following testing in an interim mode during November 2012. Commercial trading and energy flows have been taking place since 21 December 2012 at a capacity of approximately 250 megawatts. The development of a permanent solution by the contractor to allow the interconnector to operate at full capacity in its intended mode is under way and is expected to be implemented shortly. An outage may be required to implement the permanent solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_845"> The east-west interconnector is a strategically vital energy project for the island of Ireland and is financially supported under the European Energy Programme for Recovery. The interconnector has enhanced the security of the national energy supply and will increase energy market competition and facilitate the progressive development of renewable energy.</p>

            <p eId="para_846">In effect, the Minister is trying to say that any problems there might be are for the company, not for him. He then goes on to minimise the scale of the problems as they exist. Contrary to the assertions in the Minister's answer, the east-west interconnector was commercially inoperable for three months after its official launch. Since December, it has operated at approximately half its capacity. In one of many similar instances, it fluctuated last night for approximately nine hours. For a significant period of that nine hours, it was not operating at all.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> The primary cause of these issues is magnetic field emissions from the interconnector, which are causing harmonic interactions with local telecommunications. I have still not got an answer to the question I am asking the Minister. EirGrid made a submission in its environmental report in which it claimed that high-voltage direct current convertors create harmonics which can cause disruptions in telecommunications systems. We know such disruptions have occurred. EirGrid stated that specially designed DC filters are used to reduce and prevent disturbances. I understand that a decision was made to omit these specially designed harmonic filters from the interconnector and that this is the cause of the problem. I ask the Minister to confirm that and to tell the House who made the decision to omit the filters and when they did so.</p>
            <p eId="para_848"> It is not the case that there may be outages. EirGrid has advertised that between February and March the operation will be shut down for six weeks for works. Can the Minister confirm that the works are to install the harmonic filters?</p>

            <p eId="para_849">My understanding is that the system will be shut down for two to three weeks to enable whatever technical remedial works are necessary to allow the interconnector to function as intended. I can assure the Deputy that I was not trying to say anything. Whatever I wanted to say, I said. I am not trying to say anything and I am not trying to conceal anything. There is nothing unusual about a complex technical project such as this requiring occasional maintenance for as long as it is operational. The company responsible for entering into the contract with the companies that installed the system is engaged in discussions with them. It is a contractual matter for EirGrid. EirGrid has worked very well and co-operatively with Eircom on the localised interference with a small number of telephones. It is a purely technical issue. Whether it is a question of the installation of filters or something else, work has already been done to allow the interconnector to function at 250 megawatts. The remaining remedial work will be done during the two- to three-week closure I have referred to. After that, it will be a matter for EirGrid to rely on its contractual rights in raising the issues referred to by Deputy Clare Daly with the company or companies that actually did the installation work.</p>

            <p eId="para_850">That was an absolutely shocking reply. We are discussing a situation in which the interconnector will be shut down for four to six weeks. It is wrong to claim that this is a question of a few technical matters. We are discussing the fact that a multi-million-euro project has been delayed for six months to date, yet the Minister expects us to believe it is a only a matter of the usual technical issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_851"> Works on the interconnector are not complete. Compensation and bonuses were supposed to be paid. Can the Minister confirm whether that has happened? Can he answer the question I asked? If EirGrid, for which the Minister is responsible, carried out the construction in the manner for which it sought permission and installed harmonic filters to minimise disruption, why do we have a disruption to telecommunications? Is this the subject of the works that are being carried out?</p>
            <p eId="para_852">If the Minister does not know the answer, does he not think he might want to find out given the very valid health concerns raised by residents along the way?</p>

            <p eId="para_859">Responsibility for the regulation of the gas market, including disconnections, is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory regulator. </p>
            <p eId="para_860"> In line with the CER's code of practice on disconnection, electricity and gas suppliers must facilitate payment options or plans for domestic customers experiencing genuine hardship and, where appropriate, engage with a money adviser acting on behalf of the customer or a recognised charity. This must include offering the customer a prepayment meter. I understand that as of the end of 2012, over 105,000 pay-as-you-go gas and electricity meters have been installed. In addition, disconnections may not be initiated where a customer has entered into a payment plan with the supplier and is honouring that arrangement. </p>
            <p eId="para_861"> I welcome the fact that CER is working with energy suppliers to ensure that they take all reasonable steps to assist customers through this difficult period and that disconnections resulting from genuine inability to pay are minimised and only occur as a very last resort. Implementation of the measures set out in the Government's affordable energy strategy published last November is pivotal to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers and improving energy affordability.</p>

            <p eId="para_863"> In addition, the Government will continue to support the delivery of energy efficiency measures to vulnerable households in 2013. The better energy warmer homes scheme has been allocated Exchequer funding of €20 million for 2013, which is expected to result in upgrades in over 10,000 homes.</p>

            <p eId="para_864">The issues in front of us include the doubling of disconnections and the significant issue of fuel poverty. The energy regulator increased the prices even though it would have had evidence that disconnections were being doubled. We need to look at its <i>modus operandi</i>. Gas installation is another issue facing us. Due to the economic downturn, people are unable to employ certified fitters and gas installers and are instead employing people with very little competence in the area. We have had numerous discussions with the Commission for Energy Regulation which has not appreciated the urgency of the issue at hand. Cowboys are doing work on gas installation, there seems to be a breakdown between the body regulating gas installers and the commission and nobody seems to be taking a hands-on approach regarding shoddy work being done. We have seen the doubling of disconnections, and the decision by the energy regulator to award price increases must be questioned. I do not think there is a genuine acceptance of the fuel poverty and the number of people who are not using their energy sources because of fuel poverty.</p>

            <p eId="para_865">It is important to record that the number of electricity disconnections is down. The problem is in the gas area. The latest figures I have suggest that the increase is 64% year on year. It is very difficult to get figures that strip out vacant houses and seasonal lets. There is also an apparent tendency in some summer months to switch off gas. None of these factors denies the Deputy's point about the fact that fuel poverty exists and that there are households under pressure. This is why even though the number of pay-as-you-go meters has climbed, I would like to see them rise further.</p>
            <p eId="para_866"> The protocol we have put in place requires that where a pay-as-you-go meter is installed or where a payment plan is entered into, there can be no disconnection. Perhaps it ought to be better promoted. Some people have not got the message. A resort to the protocol would mean that any of the companies cannot wantonly disconnect gas supply and I hope to see more meters.</p>

            <p eId="para_867">Companies can take out advertisements in newspapers but the socioeconomic groups we are talking about by and large do not access the media. Every public representative has people coming into their offices who cannot pay their bills and are in negotiations with charity organisations to see if there is any help they can give them. However, this only carries the issue on for another month or six weeks and the underlaying issue is not addressed. Companies must step up to the mark and acknowledge that there is a serious problem with a certain group of people that they must tackle. Rather than sending out aggressive people looking for money, they should send people who will negotiate on the behalf of the company and outline the plans. Putting a protocol up on a website and national media does not really reach the targeted people.</p>

            <p eId="para_868">There is a great deal of validity in what the Deputy says. There are people who are unaware of the existence of the protocol to which I refer. Communicating to them can be a challenge. Some of the work done by some of the charity organisations in this regard is very significant. These organisations include the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and State organisations like the money advice and budgeting service. I would like to take this and every opportunity to advise people to enter into a payment plan with the supplying company or install a pay-as-you-go meter to avoid circumstances where there is disconnection, even for 24 hours.</p>

            <p eId="para_870">The matters raised by the Deputy are operational matters for Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE. The company operates in accordance with the safety framework established by the CER, which has statutory responsibility for gas safety. In addition, in accordance with section 39A of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, the CER has responsibility for the assessment of applications to construct transmission pipelines. I have no function in these operational matters. BGE owns and operates the national transmission and distribution gas network. BGE and the CER have advised that all transmission pipelines, including those in residential areas, are designed, constructed, tested, operated and maintained in accordance with Irish Standard 328:2003, the code of practice for gas transmission pipelines and pipeline installations.</p>
            <p eId="para_871"> I understand that pipelines in suburban and urban areas are constructed using high grade steel pipe and are laid with a minimum depth of cover of 1.2 m throughout. In some circumstances and over short sections, where existing major services are located and cannot be moved, it may not be possible to meet this depth of cover. In these cases, additional pipeline protection measures, such as concrete impact protection, are put in place in accordance with Irish Standard 328:2003. Once commissioned, a scheduled routine maintenance and inspection programme is applied to all pipelines. Urban streets often contain numerous different utilities in close proximity to each other, including gas, electricity, telecommunications, drainage and water. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 place the responsibility for identification and avoidance of existing infrastructure on the party carrying out the works. BGE, in carrying out pipeline projects, always seeks to minimise the impact of the construction works on the existing infrastructure along the route.</p>
            <p eId="para_872"> I understand the Deputy is referring to the Santry to East Wall gas pipeline. In regard to that pipeline, the consent of the CER to BGE’s undertaking of these works was informed by the advice of consultants engaged by the CER.</p>

            <p eId="para_873">I know from our own civil works over years that best practice for a gas main in built up areas is 2 m. Dublin City Council would have expected it to be laid at a depth of 2 m. Laying it at a depth of 1 m is detrimental to anyone coming afterwards to install infrastructure for water, drainage, telecommunications or electricity. We are looking for trouble by putting this pipe at a depth of 1 m. The city council is well aware of that but when the contractor for Bord Gáis was asked why best practice was not being followed, the response was that there was insufficient money and "It's the economy, stupid". The guidelines are not strict enough because everybody knows that where a spaghetti junction of services already exists, the new pipe has to be laid at a depth of 2 m so as to go under the existing infrastructure. Rather than observing the industry's best practice, the work is being determined by costs. This is going to put the safety of those who live near the pipe in danger. It is all very well to speak about putting the pipe in place and covering it with whatever safety structures one likes, but it is nonsense to put a pipe of this size and pressure so close to the surface.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">I am somewhat puzzled by Deputy Wallace's comments. I am told by my technical people that the Deputy has experience of this area but the clear advice is that the project is being done to standard. I cited the relevant standard and the code of practice for gas transmission pipelines and pipeline installation. The standard requires infrastructure to be laid at a depth of 1.2 m and, where there are other utilities, additional reinforcing measures must also be installed. This is the first time I have heard the phrase "It's the economy, stupid" in this regard. As much of the work was completed during the boom, I cannot see how the economy would have been an issue. I am not aware that Dublin City Council has challenged what I have said. I would be happy to ask Bord Gáis to meet the Deputy to discuss the matter. It is not a matter of opinion. If a standard has been established and is being complied with, that is the professional assessment. Deputy Wallace may have a different assessment. Let us hope it is never tested because neither of us want an accident to occur. The advice I have received suggests that the work is done to the highest standard.</p>

            <p eId="para_883">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 22 and 37 together. </p>
            <p eId="para_884"> I intend to publish the national energy efficiency action plan in the next four weeks. This second action plan reaffirms Ireland’s commitment to a 20% energy savings target in 2020 in pursuit of our EU obligations. This is equivalent to 31,925 GWh or a reduction in annual CO2 emissions of 7.7 Mt. The actions outlined in the plan are projected to realise 34,060 GWh of energy savings in 2020, which is equivalent to a 21.1% saving on the baseline period and an overachievement of 1.1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_885"> Energy efficiency is internationally recognised as one of the most cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This was confirmed in the National Economic and Social Council secretariat interim report, Towards a New National Climate Policy, which identified energy efficiency as a key route to carbon efficiency and a spur to economic growth. Energy efficiency thus forms an integral element of the national climate change adaptation framework published in December 2012 and specifically the transition to a competitive low carbon economy which is being led by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. The soon to be published heads of a climate Bill will direct the preparation of a national low carbon roadmap and sectoral roadmaps, as well as climate adaptation planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_886"> The forthcoming national energy efficiency action plan will contain 97 actions, each of which will play a part in securing a more sustainable energy future for Ireland. Of the 97 actions, the following five will play an integral role in the delivery of the national target. We will introduce a series of obligations on public sector bodies to address consumption, procurement and reporting of energy use. We will institute a national energy performance contracting process to deliver innovative models of retrofitting and financing of energy efficiency measures in the commercial and public sectors. This will be underpinned by an energy efficiency fund to which the Government has already committed €35 million in the 2013 budget as seed capital. We will introduce an appropriate pay-as-you-save model for Ireland to replace existing Exchequer supports for domestic and non-domestic energy efficiency upgrade measures. The better energy programme will deliver energy efficiency improvements across a number of sectors including energy saving targets for energy suppliers. A cross-departmental implementation group will soon be established to ensure that all the actions contained in this plan are delivered. Should all the measures set out in the plan reach their full potential by 2020, it is estimated that a potential reduction in energy spend across all sectors of approximately €2.36 billion, at 2011 prices, will be realised. A significant element of this will be Exchequer savings in the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_887"> The new energy efficiency directive sets out the policy roadmap for the period to 2020. We face significant challenges in meeting our efficiency targets, not least of which is the finance necessary to underwrite the scale of retrofit required in our building stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">My Department is prioritising work on the transposition of the new obligations in our national law so we can all reap the benefits of sustainable employment, growth and future investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_889"> The action plan and the programme for Government include a commitment to roll out a pay-as-you-save, PAYS, energy retrofit scheme for domestic buildings after 2013. The PAYS scheme proposes that the current suite of Exchequer funded grants for energy efficiency measures, excluding the low-income housing retrofit programme, will be replaced by a comprehensive national energy efficiency scheme open to households and commercial operators. This scheme will allow consumers to secure up-front financing for energy efficiency upgrades, the repayment of which will be funded from savings on their energy bill generated from the retrofit.</p>
            <p eId="para_890"> I am pleased to report that my Department, with the assistance of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, has put a project team in place, staffed with a wide range of industry experts, to deliver a project design to Government in 2013 which will include technical, legislative and financial aspects of the design of a PAYS model in the Irish context. The project team will be engaging widely with stakeholders as part of this development work, after which I will bring forward proposals to Government later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_891"> In the interim, the Government has committed in excess of €50 million in capital funding for the Better Energy programme in 2013, which will principally involve expenditure across the better energy homes, better energy warmer homes and better energy communities schemes. These schemes are administered by the SEAI and further details are available on its website. It is also my intention to establish urgently the energy efficiency fund, based on the €35 million seed capital to which I referred earlier. This funding, to be augmented by significant private sector financing, has the potential to finance significant additional retrofit works in both the public and the private sectors. Urgent work is being progressed in consultation with other Departments and NewERA to progress this initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_892">I presume somebody will be nominated to take responsibility for each of the 97 actions because, without that level of responsibility, the actions may well not be delivered. Obviously, the plan must be very practical if it is going to deliver the savings. The Minister is correct that a huge amount of money could be saved in terms of energy efficiency, including in the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_893"> Is the public sector energy efficiency working group meeting regularly and has it been delivering on the previous action plan? I know there are some very good examples of best practice in place as a prototype in several different sections of the public service. It is important there is more than a silo-based approach and that there is a cross-sectoral approach within the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_894"> The Minister said the retrofitting of buildings is limited by the amount of money that will underpin it. While I accept this, is there any prospect of leveraging funds beyond national funds for such a scheme? We have not only an obligation to meet targets at EU level because, if we do not achieve those targets, we will probably have a big demand on the Exchequer by virtue of the fact we will have to buy carbon credits. With an eye to 2050, we need to be looking way beyond 2020 if we are going to meet the targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_895">I can entirely agree with Deputy Murphy about the necessity for cross-departmental supervision of implementation of the plan's 97 actions, and that is being provided for. In fairness, the SEAI has essentially had that function and has been carrying it out very effectively. The unit in my Department, to which I referred, has for some months been involved in intensive preparations in regard to transitioning from a grants-based scheme to this pay-as-you-save model.</p>
            <p eId="para_896"> It is remarkable that the applications have fallen off, as I told the House on Question Time recently. I presume it is a function of the recession to some extent as, even if people are getting a grant, they still have to put their hand in their pocket and put up some money. Perhaps it is also that the people who are convinced of the energy efficiency measure have gone ahead and done the work. While I cannot recall off the top of my head, I understand close to 100,000 homes have been upgraded, but getting the message through to the next sliver of the population is more difficult.</p>
            <p eId="para_897"> Certainly, there is a necessity to be more energy efficient, to get down our imports and to improve the quality of our housing stock, as well as public buildings, and there is a lot of work in that. Moreover, it is not just a question of the imperative of the energy efficiency argument but the job creation that is associated with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_898"> The Deputy asked whether we can raise money outside the State. The idea behind the €35 million which I secured in the last budget is that we will be able to get matching funding domestically from the private sector, bringing the fund to in excess of €70 million. We are in discussions with Europe, and the Commission and the Commissioner are interested in this issue. A big limb of energy policy is energy efficiency, and the Commission is, of course, interested in looking at this across other member states, not just Ireland. Therefore, the question Deputy Murphy raises is very much a current one in the sense that if we can get over domestic difficulties in respect of the GGB-GGD argument, which limits our spend because of the constraints and straitjacket we are now operating in, then it should be possible to leverage money in Europe, whether from the European Investment Bank or otherwise.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">The Minister referred to public private partnerships and said he is working hard to sort this out. He did not give any indication as to timescale. Is he referring to the €35 million plus €35 million and could he explain the timescale? Has the Department or the SEAI quantified the overall level of work that is needed to maximise efficiency in both domestic and commercial buildings in this country?</p>

            <p eId="para_900">Theoretically, I am told, there are 1 million homes that would benefit from retrofit, in that the quality of the housing stock in this county is so poor that there are some 1 million homes that could be productively retrofitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_901"> The objective here is that we are committed to making the transition from the grants-based scheme to a pay-as-you-save model by 1 January. Therefore, the scheme will have to be promulgated long in advance of that. The significance of the figures of €35 million and €70 million the Deputy mentions is that we need to construct the funds so that more than 50% is from the private sector. If we can, we have to contrive to keep the fund off the State's books because there are constraints on us in terms of the spending ceilings. I understand the indications from the private sector are that there is a lot of work and many contracts in this and, therefore, it would be a productive investment by that sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_902"> Deputy Catherine Murphy's question goes further and concerns whether we can go outside the State to augment that fund, and I believe there are definite possibilities in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_903">The SEAI attic insulation grant has been very successful for senior citizens but it is flawed in that private home owners can get it but not council tenants. Fuel poverty is a major concern for everybody here and pay-as-you-save is an excellent scheme but the local authority tenant should be able to access that scheme. Has the Minister considered a way to allow these tenants access it? Is there a target date for the implementation of pay-as-you-save?</p>

            <p eId="para_904">The last time I asked a question the Minister gave me a table of figures for the fall-off in take-up of the insulation scheme which is quite dramatic.

            <p eId="para_905">Money is still spent on the warmer homes side of the scheme from which local authority tenants would benefit. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government does not work as well in this regard. Deputy Humphreys is right, however, that the pay-as-you-save model will be aimed at home owners by definition because they are the ones who must go for the product in the belief that over a set period they will be able to pay for the works done from the savings in the bill. It is a good concept.</p>
            <p eId="para_906"> I do not think Deputy Murphy is right. The existing scheme is broken down into different elements, one gets so much to do the attic or inject the walls.

            <p eId="para_910">If one gets €4,000 in the grant the odds are approximately 2:1 that one is expected to put up €8,000. Perhaps that is prohibitive. Perhaps householders who are not purchasing elsewhere in the consumer economy are not doing this work. That may be the bigger part of the explanation. There is also a danger that those who are minded to take the energy efficiency argument on board and acknowledge that it makes their homes healthier, safer and warmer went and did it in the first flush of a few years and it is more difficult to get the message through to the remainder of the population. Either way we are going to test the market. That is why a great deal of effort is going into designing a product that will be attractive to the householder.</p>
            <p eId="para_911"> The Deputy will have seen the announcement across the water last week about the green deal. If the product is not attractive to the average householder there is no point boasting about its merits when the householder does not take it up. I would also expect that the contractors who work in this area would be part of the sales process, that they would explain to people the merit of this, the significant savings in their energy bills at a time when energy bills are high because we are a net price taker. We import the energy. There is a great deal of work going into designing the product; however, you can take a horse to water but you cannot make him drink.</p>

            <p eId="para_2878">Garda stations due to close under the 2013 Garda Síochána Annual Policing Plan form part of the portfolio of State properties owned and maintained by the Office of Public Works. Accordingly, it is for that Office to decide on the future of these properties and I do not have a role in relation to the matter. The Garda Commissioner has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs. This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country. The objective will be to ensure that the best possible policing service will continue to be provided to our communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2879"> In addition, the Garda Síochána has recently acquired a number of vehicles which are being converted into mobile Garda offices and it is planned that they will be assigned to areas where Garda stations have been closed to ensure that members of the public can continue to conduct their business and interact with members of An Garda Síochána. Gardaí work closely with all communities to enhance community safety through a wide range of local fora such as Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch. Neither I as Minister nor the Government will shirk in our responsibility to do everything we can to maintain the strong Garda connection with the Community and to ensure that to the maximum extent possible resources will continue to be made available to the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_2880"> I am confident that the Garda Síochána will continue to provide a professional policing service right across the country in a manner that is effective and is consistent with the highest standards for which the Force is renowned.</p>

            <p eId="para_2882">The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and I have been informed by the Garda authorities that financial cost statements are maintained at District Headquarters level rather than at Garda station level. In the circumstances the Deputy will appreciate that the specific financial information she has sought is not readily available and I understand that the provision of such information would involve a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources which are required for other purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2883"> As the Deputy will be aware, the station she has referred to is one of the stations identified for closure under the Garda Síochána Annual Policing Plan for 2013. In that regard I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the annual financial saving estimated to arise in respect of the closure of the stations involved is Euro 4,000 per station. To a large extent this estimate relates to heating and lighting costs and it does not take account of specific repair bills, which will vary from premises to premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_2884"> The closure of the station referred to by the Deputy was proposed by the Garda Commissioner in his Policing Plan for 2013 and I would stress that the key objective involved is to promote the more efficient and effective deployment of resources rather than to secure modest cash savings. In this context the Commissioner has concluded in relation to certain stations that Garda resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if the stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained. In making his recommendations on the closure of Garda stations, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of An Garda Síochána's policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2885"> Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner has indicated he is confident that the implementation of the restructuring proposals contained in the 2013 Policing Plan will not lead to any diminution in the service provided by An Garda Síochána. In that regard he has stated that the revised structures will continue to support the Garda community philosophy through the clustering of services at policing hubs. This centralisation of services will facilitate the introduction of enhanced patrolling arrangements which, in turn, will provide increased Garda visibility as well as maintaining existing Garda links with communities throughout the country.</p>

Garda strength is now just over 13,400 with an additional 2,000 civilian support staff and 1,000 Garda Reserves. Current numbers are at the level they were at in 2006/7.

This allocation of resources is constantly monitored in the context of crime trends, policing needs and other operational strategies in place on a District, Divisional and Regional level to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2914"> In relation to the closure of Garda stations in 2013, the Commissioner has concluded that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front-line if particular stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained or if the public opening hours of other stations could be reduced at off-peak times. He has given a commitment that where a station will be closed local Garda management will consult with local communities on the alternative policing arrangements to be put in place in their area. </p>

            <p eId="para_2924">I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that an application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in August, 2011. Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. One such condition is that the applicant intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2925"> As the person referred to by the Deputy confirmed on his application form that he did not intend to reside in the State after naturalisation, one of the Statutory conditions for naturalisation, his application was deemed ineligible. The person concerned was informed of this in a letter dated 28 May 2012. It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the prescribed statutory requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2926"> Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy’s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p>
