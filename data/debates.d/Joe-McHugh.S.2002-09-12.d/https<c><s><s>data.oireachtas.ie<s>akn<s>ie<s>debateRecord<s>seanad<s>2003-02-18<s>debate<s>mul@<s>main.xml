          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to report on the progress being made regarding the DAFRD scrapie genotyping project.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to indicate his future plans for the retention and development of maternity services at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Leyden of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the current situation regarding the development and refurbishment of St. Colman's Ward, Roscommon County Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Mansergh of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take measures to address the spate of theft and vandalism of churches of different denominations in different parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline when the Youth Work Act 2001 will be fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_12">To ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food his Department's plans for the future of soft fruit research in view of the closure of the only existing research facility at Clonroche, County Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I regard the matters raised by Senators Henry, Ulick Burke, Leyden, Mansergh and McHugh as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Henry, Ulick Burke and Leyden and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator John Paul Phelan as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter. Senators Mansergh and McHugh may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_15">I am not opposed to the Order of Business. Will the Leader indicate the reason the Government proposes the House should not sit on Thursday of this week? If one reads Standing Orders for the Seanad, it is clear that meetings of the House should take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays and other days at the discretion of the House. It is breaking precedent that the House should meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and not on Thursday. I propose that the Leader initiate discussions between the Whips of all groups to arrive at a situation where we would debate important issues on Thursdays. If the Government has no business to present to the House on Thursday, I propose that the Opposition do so. There are 14 separate items on the Order Paper from colleagues on all sides of the House. If the Government cannot utilise the time available on Thursday, I propose that the Opposition be given the opportunity to debate these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Does the Leader believe the €241,000 spent by Ministers on having their photographs taken was good value for money given the potential for the doctoring of photographs which can take place? In light of the constraints on the public purse, does she agree that this is lavish expenditure and that it is not justifiable in any circumstances, whether for good or bad pictures?</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Will the Leader make time available – if not this week, then next week – for a debate on housing? A number of issues have arisen in regard to the latest pay deal and affordable housing. There seems to be a lack of clarity from the Department of the Environment and Local Government concerning promises made in the pay deal in regard to affordable housing. In addition, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has put a cap on the rental subsidy for those on low incomes trying to find rented accommodation. I call for a debate on housing in the near future and I request that the Minister with responsibility for housing come before the House to debate the issue in detail.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_18">The last point raised by Senator Brian Hayes could be dealt with in an early debate on the new programme, Sustaining Progress, which deals with housing. It also contains a proposal agreed by Government to introduce new legislation on rented accommodation and the rights of tenants. It would be helpful to have such a debate. We also need to look specifically at the needs of first-time buyers and at the possibility of giving tax relief to people saving for a deposit on a house since such relief is given to people saving for pensions, etc. We should consider having <i>ad hoc</i> savings accounts, for people saving for deposits on houses, which would be tax efficient and in respect of which people could obtain tax relief. I would like the Government to consider that.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">Hundreds of thousands of people here and millions around the world marched at the weekend in respect of the Iraq situation. I am not calling for a debate on Iraq, because I have no doubt we will have more such debates. However, various reports, radio shows and talk-ins since then have all referred to how politicians can be made to listen. I would appreciate it if the Leader took the trouble to inform the radio stations and media outlets that politicians are listening, but that the Government is not. Many politicians marched last weekend and many are listening. It would be helpful if we could distinguish between politicians and the Government. I am sure the Leader would be happy to do that for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Another issue at which we must look is how prices impact on inflation and how they affect consumers. We need to look at that and at price control, or dare I mention the latter for fear of over-exciting too many people? I would like to hear the Government's view on this issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_21">I wish to take up the issue raised by Senator O'Toole when referring to the demonstrations in Dublin and elsewhere last Saturday. I was astonished to hear the Taoiseach on radio this morning suggest, as only he could do, that people were demonstrating in favour of current Government policy. I would not presume to speak on behalf of everybody who was at the march in Dublin on Saturday, but I can certainly speak on behalf of some of them. I ask the Leader to make it crystal clear to the Taoiseach that the majority of people at the march on Saturday were not demonstrating in favour of current Government policy. The majority of people there are anxious that the Government take a distinctly different stance to the approach of sitting on the fence it has adopted in recent weeks. They are also anxious that we should support France, Germany, Belgium and the other neutral non-aligned countries in the European Union in saying to the United States that we do not believe the case for war is proven, that we do not believe it has been sufficiently proven that Saddam Hussein is in possession of weapons which present an immediate threat to his neighbours or those further afield and that this and a second UN resolution are prerequisites for war. I ask the Leader to convey this to the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">On a somewhat lighter note, I was interested and a little disturbed, as I am sure others were, to read the findings of an opinion poll published in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which suggest that up to 50% of young people continue to smoke. It appears most do so somewhat intolerantly of the wishes of others in that the bulk of smokers still feel quite entitled to go into pubs and restaurants and continue smoking, thereby inflicting passive smoking on others. As the debate on the issue has a long way to go, we could perform a service by inviting to the House the Minister for Health and Children and other interested parties to debate the report of the expert group on passive smoking to see whether we can move on the issue. It will be very difficult for the Minister to implement the ban without a greater measure of public support than appears to be available.</p>

        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_23">I want to raise the important issue of the OECD report on the incidence of suicide in this country published over the weekend. The shocking statistics indicate that we have the second highest rate of suicide of 30 countries throughout the world and the highest rate among those under 25 years of age, of whom a huge proportion are young men. Will the Leader of the House arrange for the relevant Minister or Ministers – this issue is covered by a number of Departments – to come to this Chamber to discuss the issue?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_7">

        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_25">I read in the newspapers this morning that a young boy of 11 or 12 years was let go by a judge yesterday because there was no place in which to detain him. Will the Leader invite to the House the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to debate this issue? The young boy was described as being "out of control". I do not know whose words those are but for a young boy of 11 or 12 years to be described as being "out of control" is a shame on the State which has brought him to this stage and not provided the facilities to enable him to lead a good life which any young child should be expected to lead. It is very serious that young children of 11 or 12 years are coming before judges because they are out of control. What has led to this situation is the fact that the Government is out of control.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_26">I ask the Leader to invite to the House the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to debate the imposition of a €35 fee by the Shannon Fisheries Board for a yearly licence and an €18 charge for tourists for coarse fishing on the River Suck, the River Derryhippo, Stonehams Lake and adjoining tributaries in the area where I live. The Leader, who was practically born in the River Shannon, will be aware of the situation.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_28">The Leader who has been fishing from a very young age will realise this will cause huge damage to the tourism industry and coarse fishing in the area. It is a very selective charge because it does not apply on those parts of the River Shannon under the ownership of the ESB. The bailiffs were out recently reminding tourists that they could not fish the rivers in question. I cannot use my boat to fish on the little river flowing behind my land unless I pay a fee to the Shannon Fisheries Board for doing nothing on the river.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_32">A recent report was published on the quality of drinking water. It is important to debate the issue in the House because the quality of water in 1,536 group water schemes monitored is less than satisfactory. It is important that we invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the House to inform Senators of his plans in relation to the protection of public health. The State should provide pure and wholesome water for its citizens but it appears that 10% of the water consumed by them is contaminated. It is vital that we have a debate on this serious issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_33">Since 1996 meat and bonemeal have been quite rightly banned from animal feed which has to be rendered instead. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, has informed the beef industry that the subsidy paid to enable such material to be sent to Germany – there is no market for it here – will no longer apply from 1 March. This announcement has caused a great deal of concern in the industry and possible export markets. I ask the Leader of the House to ensure the Minister recognises the urgency of the issue, given that the deadline will be reached in about ten days. I gather that it may not be possible to render meat and bonemeal after that date. Even if it is, there may be no outlet for it. The material being sent to Germany for incineration at present will not be dealt with as there is no suitable incinerator in Ireland. I ask the Leader to draw the Minister's attention to this urgent matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_17">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_34">When is it envisaged that the heritage functions of Dúchas, within the Department of the Environment and Local Government, will be dealt with? The Government decided that the functions of Dúchas would be transferred to that Department but it is envisaged in a major review conducted by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, that built and natural heritage functions will be split. I assume that the built heritage will be the responsibility of the Office of Public Works, as was formerly the case, and that the natural heritage will be the responsibility of Dúchas. Will Dúchas remain part of the Department of the Environment and Local Government? Will the word "heritage" be included in the name of the Department? Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come to the House to address these matters and enlighten Senators?</p>

        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_18">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_35">I ask the Leader to invite to the House the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, who seems to be a popular man, as many Senators have asked that he attend. I would like a debate with him on the Government's policy, or lack thereof, on homelessness. Members of the Oireachtas do not have to go far from this House to see some of the many unfortunate people who are homeless, for whatever reason. I would like the Minister to explain the Government's policies for solving this problem which is of paramount importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">Other Senators have mentioned the problems faced by first-time buyers. I am sure many Members have received telephone calls from distraught young people who have to pay an additional €1,500, or more, as a result of VAT increases. They have to pay a significant amount of money to put a roof over their heads, especially in the light of the loss of about €3,900 when the first-time buyer's grant was abolished.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">A constituent who is a farmer contacted me by telephone yesterday. A car pulled up beside him last Friday as he was doing drainage work on some land he bought recently. A man got out and read him his rights. The man told my constituent that if he wished to remain silent, that was fine. The individual in question was from the Dúchas office and the lands had apparently been designated as a special area of conservation. The purchaser of the lands was not aware of this, nor was his solicitor.</p>

Consideration should be given to situations where people can no longer sustain the investment over the period envisaged for the scheme. People should not be penalised if they want to opt out now and they should get back all the funds they have invested. There should be recognition of that within the scheme, rather than the imposition of a penalty if people decide to pull out at an early stage.</p>

A Government Department requested that the House take a particular Bill on Thursday and we agreed to do so. However, late last Thursday, the office of the Minister contacted us with a request that the Bill be deferred to a later date. While I am aware that Members are anxious to be in attendance on Thursdays, I am sorry the arrangement had to be cancelled. I take the Senator's point on sittings on Wednesdays and Thursdays and hope a cancellation like this will not arise in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">Senator Brian Hayes also requested a debate on housing matters, including the cap imposed by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on private rented accommodation. In my experience, owners of houses whose rental income was paid by the health boards continually increased their rents.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">Senator O'Toole requested a debate on the new programme, Sustaining Progress. We have been asked to delay debating it in anticipation that there may be further agreement. The Senator also asked if it would be possible to provide tax relief for those who hold savings accounts with a view to purchasing a house. The Senator went on to say that, although many politicians participated in last Saturday's march against war in Iraq and are listening to the voice of the people, Governments are not. However, the Government is listening. This morning the Taoiseach said he was pleased with the size and extent of the march. The Senator also requested a debate on prices and competition which I have been seeking with the appropriate Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Senator McDowell outlined what he understood the Taoiseach to have said about the situation in Iraq but that is not how I heard it. I understood him to say all European Union member states had agreed with the statement issued after the summit in Brussels yesterday. EU leaders made clear that they did not agree with war and published a coherent declaration of their position.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">Senator McDowell also referred to the proposal to ban smoking in pubs. I am also surprised at the numbers who agree with the view that smoking should be allowed in pubs and other public places. A debate on the issue would be useful and help to underpin the Minister's legislative proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">Senator Brady raised the issue of the suicide rate among males aged under 25 years. The rate in Ireland is the highest or second highest among different groups of countries. It is a huge problem. Young men appear to find it very difficult to communicate their worries or concerns to others. A debate on the issue would be useful and I thank the Senator for raising it.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">Senator Terry referred to the case involving an 11 year old boy in which the presiding judge said there was no place to put him. He was described, perhaps by the social worker in charge of the case, as being out of control. The case is a shocking indictment of the system. The boy concerned is still a child. The Senator requested the attendance of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to debate the issue. If a Minister attends the House to debate a Bill, it is very difficult to secure his or her further attendance to debate other issues as he or she may have to progress the Bill in this or the other House.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">Senator Leyden requested the attendance of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to debate the €30 fee for coarse fishing in the small rivers throughout the midlands and surrounding counties. I was not born in the water, but I have been quite involved with it over the years. Water births are quite popular at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Senator Bannon requested that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, come before the House. The Senator may know that the Minister yesterday visited Strokestown, which is quite near the Deputy's home county, and announced funding of €100 million to make group water schemes much more palatable.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">Senator Quinn raised the issue of the subsidy for the removal of meat and bonemeal. This has to be sent abroad because there is no way of processing it here.

          <p eId="para_86">Senator Coghlan requested a debate on Dúchas and suggestions about the separating of responsibilities pertaining to the built and natural environments. The Senator asked which responsibilities will remain with the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">Senator Cummins raised the issue of homelessness and asked that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, be invited to the House to discuss it. The issue of the VAT increase affecting first-time buyers was also raised.

          <p eId="para_116">I am delighted to come to the House. It is nice to be back to speak on a topic very close to my heart. Rural Ireland is changing rapidly. As politicians, we have a responsibility to recognise the changing nature of our society and adapt national policies accordingly. Any rural based Senator will explain that working in rural development can be very frustrating, though the rewards can be incredible. The challenge of rural population decline is probably the greatest we face. There is a vicious circle at work in which as more people move away, it becomes harder to maintain and attract services. The withdrawal of services tends to force further movement away from rural areas. We must recognise that farm incomes are in decline and it is not possible for a family to earn a decent living from the amount of land that would have provided one 30 or 40 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">The Government continues to work closely with farm organisations and our colleagues in Brussels to support the Irish farmer but whether we like it or not world markets are forcing major changes in the agriculture sector. While this does not mean the end of farming in rural Ireland, it does mean the rural economy must diversify. In the past rural economies were models of entrepreneurship, diversification and self-sufficiency. The range of skills and professions in rural Ireland at one time was breathtaking. There were farmers, thatchers, tailors, labourers, blacksmiths, weavers, cobblers, doctors, teachers and priests. It would be wrong to think of the rural economy of the past as purely agricultural. As world markets and societies have changed, the economy has changed and many of the old skills are obsolete and have died out. We cannot preserve the past and have to build a future.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">A vibrant, thriving rural Ireland is dependent on our acceptance of change which is the reason we must embrace technology and rekindle the spirit of entrepreneurship. Farmers must be encouraged to diversify into organic farming, small food production and agri-tourism, just some of the areas of which one immediately thinks. Part-time farming is recognised by a majority of farmers and their spouses as their future and they must be supported. They have been voting with their feet in this direction. Some of the main problems for young and not so young farmers who farm full-time are loneliness and isolation. In this context, off-farm employment has created an important social environment for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Technology brings the world to people. There are great opportunities for rural Ireland in broadband and IT which we must employ to their full potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">Tackling the problem of infrastructure provision is one of the biggest challenges facing me as Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. People talk about the chicken and egg situation with which we are now faced in rural Ireland: which comes first – the infrastructure or the population? There are those who argue that there is no point in providing infrastructure in areas with low or declining populations. They argue that one must have a critical mass, a certain level of population, before it is economically viable to provide infrastructure. I subscribe to the other school of thought, however, believing that if the infrastructure is provided first, it will give people what they need in order to move back home or start life afresh in rural areas. The man or woman who decides to move with his or her family to rural Ireland and set up a business is, in many ways, a much more valuable asset to that community than any multinational which may be established in the nearest city 40 or 50 miles away. If the infrastructure is not in place, however, it will not be possible for him or her to do so and, therefore, the dream of rearing a family in a close-knit rural community will remain just a dream.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">Last June the Taoiseach showed beyond a shadow of doubt that the Government recognised these problems and that we were determined to work toward practical solutions. Bringing the areas of local, community, rural and Gaeltacht development, not forgetting the islands, together in one Department shows clearly that the Government is focused on communities and that we are determined to make a significant improvement in the quality of life of those living in both depopulated rural areas and disadvantaged urban areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is unique in that it works in tandem with all other Departments. Just as rural development policy embraces all facets of life, the Department's work is closely meshed with that of all other Departments and Government agencies. One of the methods used to progress this work is an interdepartmental committee. In addition, I am a member of the Cabinet committees on social inclusion, the information society, and housing, infrastructure and public private partnerships.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Detailed guidelines on rural proofing were provided for all Departments early last year. Rural proofing determines the likely impact of policies on the physical, economic and social conditions of the rural population. The Government is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally. My Department is involved in a wide range of EU and national investment programmes to promote this objective. All the work on rural development carried out by the Department is underpinned by the White Paper on Rural Development, Ensuring the Future, published in August 1999. The rural development policy agenda is defined in the White Paper as:</p>
          <p eId="para_124">all Government policies and interventions which are directed towards improving the physical, economic and social conditions of people living in the open countryside, in coastal areas, towns and villages and in smaller urban centres outside of the five major urban areas. The agenda will, at the same time, facilitate balanced and sustainable regional development while tackling issues of poverty and social inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The national development plan is the main vehicle for delivering the commitments contained in the White Paper. There is a specific chapter on agriculture and rural development with a commitment to public investment of €8.5 billion over the next seven years in actions which directly impact on rural areas. This package covers rural environment protection, early farmer retirement, headage and forestry, rural infrastructure and enterprises, capital investment for food and fisheries, marketing, research and development for agriculture, food and fisheries, as well as training in agriculture, food, forestry and fisheries.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">As Senators will be aware, I am in the process of reviewing the operations of Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Western Development Commission, both of which come under my remit. I stress that I am not doing this in any negative way but in recognition of the fact that, despite the best efforts of such agencies, job creation in rural areas has not matched either the demand or the educational qualifications of our rural population. Arising from these ongoing reviews, I recently had discussions with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Harney, regarding rural enterprise. Discussions in respect of these matters are ongoing and it is hoped to make an announcement regarding same in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The Leader, ADM, CDP and CLÁR programmes are all run by my Department. Each has an impact on rural communities and plays a part in reversing the current trend of population decline in rural areas. Each scheme in its own way focuses on the development of rural communities and the provision of social or infrastructural supports. The aim of these schemes is not to spoon-feed communities or to encourage a lethargic expectation of Government handouts, but rather to encourage bottom-up community development and a real sense of active and vibrant community involvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">CLÁR, in particular, has put the issue of rural depopulation on the national agenda. If CLÁR does nothing but create an awareness of this as a social injustice, it will have served a good purpose. However, I believe it has done much more. It has a clear policy of action rather than talk. As Senators are probably aware, this initiative is part of the RAPID programme, which seeks to focus investment and development into those areas of the country that, through population decline or high deprivation, tended not to benefit fully from previous national development plans. Whereas the urban areas were selected on poverty criteria, I felt this would be an inappropriate method of selection for rural areas. As a consequence, we picked the rural areas on the basis of population decline. If one looks at deprivation scores in rural areas, it can be seen that those without jobs and those without houses move to the cities. Their deprivation is recorded in the city rather than the rural statistics. It is fair to say that many of the problems of rural areas were exported in the past in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">I referred earlier to the syndrome where services are being withdrawn from rural areas because of population decline and of the latter being caused by the withdrawal of services. It is to end this vicious circle that CLÁR is focusing on these areas. CLÁR is neither a new agency nor a parallel agency and, therefore, all of its schemes must be fully in line with the policies and programmes of the various line Departments. This programme is operating through the existing agencies and is not setting up a parallel system, thus obviating duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">In 2002, €14.14 million was spent under the various measures introduced under the programme by my Department. That levered out considerably more expenditure in matching funds from other Departments and agencies. I am currently in further discussions with various Departments in relation to other new initiatives under this programme and I expect to be in a position to announce further roll out in the new future.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">It is fair to say that if my name has been linked with anything in the past three years, it has been with the debate on the national spatial strategy and the sub-debate on rural planning and one-off housing. I must stress that this was never a debate about houses. The debate about one-off rural housing is essentially about people and a peopled countryside. With the publication of the national spatial strategy late last year, the Government again showed its commitment to tackling the issue of the revitalisation of rural areas. In addition to setting out practical measures to ensure balanced regional development in the country as a whole, the national spatial strategy makes it crystal clear that people from or living in a rural area have the right to work, live and build houses in those areas. This is a strategy that has listened to the voice of the people and is now meeting their needs in a balanced and sensible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">In many ways, the Government is focusing on the issue of rural development and coming up with practical solutions to the problems we face. There is no doubt that we have a long way to go, but there is a definite commitment and drive to get the job done. However, there are some issues that cannot be dealt with by Cabinet Ministers alone. We have spoken about planning, the decline in farm incomes, the White Paper on Rural Development, Government strategies and schemes but there is one other issue that is difficult to pin down, hard to put a name on and for which it is impossible to blame anyone specifically. It is the one issue which will wipe out any progress Government makes if we do not tackle it.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Put very simply, this issue is mindset, the attitude that the only real places to do business and to develop are urban centres. Politicians can come up with policies which Departments can implement and we can all wax lyrical about the values of rural and community development but unless we can change that mindset, we might as well give up and go home. Planners, investors, business people, developers, entrepreneurs and many others, apart from politicians alone, have the power to make changes. Balanced development, rural revitalisation and community building have to be a united effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The problem is bigger than rural Ireland and politics. Rural politicians, service providers and local authorities are not the only ones affected by depopulation. As people leave the communities in which they have lived for generations, our cities and towns are bursting at the seams. Every day city and county managers are struggling to cope with the demand for infrastructure in urban centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Rural depopulation and urban agglomeration are two sides of the same coin. Tackle one and one solves the other. We should give workers real options to move out of urban centres. All of a sudden they will be able to afford to buy a house, their children will be able to go to smaller schools and people will get to spend more time at home and a lot less time stuck in traffic. More people in rural areas means the rural community is revitalised. It is that simple. Schools which were on the verge of closure will stay open, the local shop will get a new lease of life and the local bus service will start up again to ferry workers, shoppers and schoolchildren around. On the other hand, overcrowding in urban schools will be alleviated, the drive to work will take 20 minutes instead of two hours and the pressure on housing supply will reduce. It is all so heartbreakingly obvious.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">There is little point, however, in the Government providing services in rural areas if planners dictate that people cannot live there, if businesses will not look beyond the Pale for new start-up options, if developers only think of higher profit margins in the cities and if investors refuse to take a risk on rural based enterprises. As the old saying goes, "You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink." We would want to be careful that the well does not dry up while waiting for the horse to drink. It is time for everyone in the country, urban and rural, to see the common position and realise the development of rural Ireland would also benefit urban Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_77">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_137">I welcome the Minister. I also thank the Leader of the House for her efforts in trying to secure the Minister's presence here since I first placed this item on the Order Paper six months ago. I congratulate the Minister on his openness and frankness. We are all in this together. We have a problem in rural Ireland which it will take a long time to get sorted.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">When I first became involved in community development in 1995, the same language was used to discuss the build-up to the White Paper on Rural Development. What has been done is quite visible in any rural area such as west Galway, County Mayo or County Donegal. Roads that were never tarred are now being tarred. It is also encouraging that an effort is being made to hold on to our language.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The town and village renewal programmes have been quite successful in County Donegal. The changes initiated by the Better Local Government programme have brought about improvements in the structure of local government. There are now different service divisions, such as directorates of community and enterprise, planning, roads, the environment and sanitary and housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">A problem exists in regard to the lack of clarity in accessing and drawing down funding. Local groups who try to access funding via the Internet do not know if they should be applying to the local authorities or other agencies. Sometimes local authorities do not know if it will get the funding or if it will go to Leader companies or ADM partnership groups. While I wish to make my contribution as constructive as possible, it has to be said that there must be proper dissemination of information among these groups; they need to know the mechanisms to use to draw down funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The Internet revolution has increased the potential among individuals and community groups in regard to seeking funding for local projects or group sewerage or water schemes. However, if people are unsuccessful in accessing what they seek, it will erode their confidence to the further detriment of rural communities. Community groups are not just interested in rural regeneration, they have their own programmes and would benefit from some transparency in respect of the current funding arrangements. In an effort to bring about a constructive approach in conjunction with BLG, a booklet should be produced to clarify the options available.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I met Liam Scollan, chief executive of the Western Development Commission, in 1996. We spoke the same language on the revitalisation of rural areas, organic farming, agri-tourism projects and turning towns into market towns. The Western Development Commission carried out research on a European scale in regard to ideas on the revitalisation of rural towns and villages in both western and eastern Europe. It was looking at areas where investment in the social and physical infrastructure of certain towns and villages had led to their survival. The effort that was made to develop and invest in indigenous local projects with the ultimate aim of keeping people in rural areas appeared to pay dividends.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">We need the Western Development Commission. I say this in the context of the review that is currently under way. The commission was responsible for the genesis of rural development in 1995 and I have some experience of working in conjunction with it. At that time, its two priorities were broadband and tourism – agri-tourism in particular. The simple message was that investment in broadband in rural towns and villages would ultimately result in a reduction in the agglomeration of people in urban centres, to borrow a phrase from the Minister. Technology would have allowed people to "tele-cottage" in their own homes in the rural countryside. We missed an open goal in the intervening period. Not enough emphasis was put on broadband ISDN lines in rural areas. The notion of a broadband infrastructure from Malin Head to Mizen Head appears to be mainly aspirational. It is imperative that we get this back on the drawing board. I am aware that broadband comes under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, but there is an opportunity for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to show some vision and tie in an interdepartmental approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The review in regard to Leader companies, county enterprise boards and Údarás na Gaeltachta is important. We do not need duplication, we need an integrated approach. An integrated strategy is not just needed for the west, it is also needed for rural areas in general. The Minister's Department can act as a facilitator in allowing this to happen. I congratulate him in terms of his vision and his straight-talking manner, but the real test is how this will be put into action. I do not know how long the honeymoon period will last. The only way to instil confidence in a programme such as this is if people can see some result.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">The roads department of Donegal County Council is involved in rural tertiary roads. However, the planning and community and enterprise sections are also involved in regard to any village or town renewal scheme. How will these different directorates access funding? Next October, if large amounts of money have been allocated to Leader programmes or to local authorities but there is nothing tangible for people to see, the honeymoon period will truly be over.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The Minister has already welcomed the decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture and Food to Gaeltacht areas. That is a natural progression, particularly if we are serious about retaining people in rural areas and building the services around them. An American information technology company called Prumerica is based in Letterkenny. As far as I am aware, it allows some of its workforce to work from home. There is no reason someone living on Fanad Head or Malin Head or at Rosses Point cannot stay at home to do his or her work. The associated benefits to communities of people remaining to work in their areas are manifold.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">I could have used this opportunity as a platform to attack the Minister. I could have said that action is not being taken and that rural areas are still in decline. However, I would rather work with the Minister whose heart appears to be in the right place in respect of rural areas. People in rural local authorities are willing to work with the Minister's ideas and vision. The current climate of confidence in rural areas will be severely damaged if we do not seize this opportunity to get the channels of funding sorted out as a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">That is the main point I wish to make. It has been the message from all the community groups – women's groups, local action groups, etc. – to which I have spoken. Their sons and daughters have been accessing information on the CLÁR programme on the Internet and making on-line applications, but they do not know how to draw down the funding. The same is true of local authority members and officials. Like the Minister, my heart is with rural areas and I accept that things will change.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">In ten or 15 years, people will have different occupations from those they hold at present. The typical returned emigrant has spent time in London or Manchester or on the east coast of the United States. The majority of our returning emigrants have worked in the construction industry and are coming back to Ireland to continue working in the same industry. They are bringing their talents, skills and expertise back to this country, but they are working primarily in urban centres. We should use the expertise of our returned emigrants to install broadband technology. These people have installed telecommunications infrastructure throughout the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The emigrants who return to Ireland 20 or 30 years from now will be talented, educated and skilful. We must have adequate telecommunications and road infrastructure in rural areas – we do not need to build motorways or dual carriageways, merely to fill the potholes – for those future emigrants who will have gained working experience in Germany, Silicon Valley, Finland, Sweden and other parts of the world. Our emigrants are the most talented in the world and we must have services in place for them when they return.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">I thank the Minister for coming before the House. I also appreciate the time he took recently to meet a local group in County Donegal. Unfortunately, the result of that meeting was not satisfactory, but, through working together and discussing our problems, we can find solutions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LabhrasOMurchu" eId="spk_78">
          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_152">Fáiltím roimh an Aire agus roimh an ráiteas spreagúil dearfach a chuir sé os ár gcomhair inniu. Ní hé seo an chéad uair a sheas sé an fód ar son mhuintir na tuaithe. Ní amháin gur sheas sé an fód ach is minic a léirigh sé samhlaíocht agus tacaíocht tré ghníomhaíocht le tamall fada anuas.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">I thank the Minister for his positive contribution. Anyone who looks back on the public pronouncements of the Minister for many years will see clearly where his heart is. To use native American Indian language, he never speaks with forked tongue. One always knows the Minister is speaking sincerely and that he is particularly anxious to promote this debate and come up with positive action.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">This debate is timely because yesterday I chaired a convention in Oranmore in County Galway, which was attended by rural dwellers from the four provinces. There was official representation from the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICA, the GAA, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and the various rural-based organisations. A number of things struck me during that five or six hour convention. First, the people present were not all middle-aged or older; there were many young people present. Second, there was an absolute determination to fight the rural cause. There was no question of leaving rural Ireland behind in some defeatist manner. All were determined to take a stand. In many of the pronouncements I heard echoes of Fintan Lalor or Michael Davitt, but in a very progressive and up-beat way. That has to be the right approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">Let me take two steps back and focus on urbanisation before I talk about the decline of rural areas. In the past 48 hours there has been an extensive debate on traffic congestion in London. We have all heard of the new congestion tax which has been introduced there. This issue was discussed on Vincent Browne's radio programme last night, with particular reference to Dublin. There is no doubt that indiscriminate urbanisation has changed the physical and social fabric of Dublin city. In terms of matters such as crime, traffic, pollution and personal alienation, Dublin city has changed out of all proportion and no one believes this trend will change in a positive way in the future. When we discuss rural decline, we should also talk about the disadvantages we see occurring, not just in Dublin and the major cities but also in some of the towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I do not intend to pillory An Taisce, but that organisation must be brought into this debate because it is involved at every level. Some of the ideas being expounded by An Taisce are not suitable for this country, nor are they traditional to it. The suggestion that people who want to live on their own land in rural areas should be pushed into the nearest town or village is based on the British idea of what a village and a town should be. In Ireland, dispersed villages, street villages and cluster villages are all traditional and some date back 4,000 or 5,000 years. Why should it be necessary to import something that is not suitable to Irish requirements?</p>
          <p eId="para_157">In that regard, we will have to look at the planning issues. For the past 30 years I have been travelling back and forth to America. I have had the opportunity of talking with first and second generation Irish people who have informed me that the first generation left Ireland on foot of economic necessity. For many years those of us who travelled through the west saw houses locked up, their roofs falling in and their gardens unattended. These houses were symbols of the manner in which rural areas were declining. We were told people either did not want to live in rural areas or could not do so. We know now that people want to live in rural areas, but in many cases they are being prevented from doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">When I was canvassing during a recent election, I knocked on the door of a fine new house in Cashel. A woman with two young children answered and I remarked on how nice her house was. She said, in a very melancholy fashion, that it was a nice house and had cost a lot of money, but that it was not where she wanted to live. She said:</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I wanted to live out on our own farm. My parents are getting old and if I was living near them I could look after them and they could look after their grandchildren. We would not have to throw our responsibilities back onto State services. I was not allowed to build a house on our own land.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Farmers will say – they said it yesterday in Oranmore – that they are made to accept all the obligations and responsibilities for land. When an opportunity to use the land presents itself, however, one would imagine it was not in their ownership. An Taise will have to talk in partnership with communities because what is happening cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">When the Taoiseach spoke in Galway last week, I was delighted that he made the same points as the Minister today. He spoke about the traditional concept of villages in Ireland and said they would and should be adhered to in the future. Recently I became very concerned when I heard An Taisce was returning membership fees to certain people because it was obvious it did not agree with their views. This is a body which has a statutory base in legislation and is one of the prescribed bodies under the planning Acts. If the reports are correct, it is now being selective in its membership. I am told I can substantiate them by those who said it to me and had their membership fees returned. This matter will have to be looked at by an Oireachtas committees because it is a fundamental issue in the current debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">I wish to refer to the reason people want to live in rural Ireland. The Minister rightly referred to infrastructure. It is true that if the infrastructure is not in place, one will not encourage people to set up in rural Ireland. Therefore, the infrastructure has to be provided and we are not just talking about roads. Those who argue that infrastructure is not in place for one-off housing are wrong. Let us break it down. We are talking about roads, water, either a public or private supply, electricity and telecommunications, all of which are in place in rural Ireland. The only issue that might apply is public sewerage. There are those who will say septic tanks can be more environmentally friendly than other types of sewerage schemes but the infrastructure is actually in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">One of the nicest images of the debate came from the Minister who featured on the "Late Late Show" one night while a member of An Taisce was moving away from the realm of its brief to social and economic issues which did not seem to be appropriate. When they suggested to the Minister that if one built a house on a particular boreen that the postman would not have to go up it, the Minister rightly said An Taisce was wrong because it was possible there was already another house on the boreen. Therefore, the postman would have to go up in any event. There is now a possibility that the postman will not do so and that, more than likely, a box will be put in place at the end of the boreen. It is important to note that the arguments being made are false. Therefore, one must ask the question, if the arguments are not credible, what is the agenda? The agenda seems to be to have huge green ranches to which certain people can travel and have their picnic on a Sunday afternoon and then return to urban areas with all their infrastructure and facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">In County Mayo a meeting took place of rural dwellers which 400 attended at short notice. The clear message was that the people of rural Ireland no longer intended to be treated as second-class citizens. In fairness to the people concerned, they are not anti-urban area or anti-people from urban Ireland going into rural Ireland but they are not prepared to accept second-class status.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">How many can recall the famous "Late Late Show" debate which featured the late Monsignor Horan when he was promoting the idea of a regional airport at Knock when a couple of politicians criticised him for building an airport in a foggy, boggy part of Ireland? I still remember the late Monsignor Horan in his own nice, self-assured, way saying, "I am only a simple parish priest but I know this much – putting one DART carriage on the Dún Laoghaire line and maintaining it will cost far more than my airport in Knock ever will." The point he was making was that we never questioned expenditures when it came to urban areas but were very quick to do so when it came to rural Ireland. In the London and Luton areas, to which I travel regularly, I meet those availing of the service to Knock Airport. They come home on a Friday night and return on a Monday morning. Their social life has changed. They are in touch with their own country and helping the economy by spending their money. Who will now stand up and say the idea of an airport at Knock was wrong? In the same way let us stop knocking expenditure when it is related to rural Ireland and instead look at it in a positive equal manner. Those who wipe rural Ireland out of the equation should be reminded of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">A statistic which I regard as particularly relevant is that one third of the Irish population live in rural Ireland. That is a major number and we cannot have them as an adjunct to all policies and philosophies put forward either in the Seanad or public life generally. Therefore, we have to take on board what exactly is needed in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">If we were to break down the figures for the numbers of visitors to Ireland, I guarantee that many of them travel to rural attractions, places they can see not just as a setting in their own right but in the context of their historical, architectural value also. If tourism can be boosted further, this is something that should be done. The idea of tourists being guided towards Dublin is not wise because Dublin is already over-congested with traffic as a result of which people are finding it difficult to get to work and their quality of life is being undermined. If we are to find an answer, let us do it under the title of "partnership" which should comprise rural communities, the Government, politicians, An Taisce, local councils and business people. It should not be a matter of criticising each other but of sitting down and working in a co-operative manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">A person capable of providing us with leadership in this regard is one who has the advantage of understanding city life and has moved, not just to rural Ireland but to the Gaeltacht. He understands the traditions, values and quality of life, all of which are important. The more we are outraged by anti-social behaviour the more we are outraged by what is happening in urban areas and will start looking at what we can do about it. We begin to ask the questions, where are the guidelines, and where is the quality of life? I am of the view that there is still much quality of life in rural Ireland today. It is not just about houses, population, jobs, it is also about the stability and quality of life.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">Ar dtús ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire anseo inniu. As a Senator who comes from one of the so-called major urban areas, probably the one that has benefited least, the city of Waterford, the debate in which we are engaged is close to my heart. Those living in rural areas should bear in mind there are many who live in urban areas who have come from rural backgrounds and their hearts are in rural areas also.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The Minister has spoken previously about services to small remote villages, of which there are many in County Waterford. In recent years An Post, the banks and several other institutions have withdrawn their services from many rural towns. This is a retrograde step. Villages and towns which have had access to those services have suffered because of their withdrawal.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">I refer in particular to An Post, which I mentioned here previously. Only two years ago, it spent €4.5 million on a state-of-the-art sorting office to deal with post from the surrounding areas. Recently, it has been mooted that this office will be abandoned and that sorting will be done in Cork city. When one thinks of the amount of money spent and of the many rural post offices being closed, it puts into perspective what that company thinks about people in rural communities. Not enough thought is given to rural communities by these companies and, in many instances, profit is put before service to the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I wish to deal now with the question of decentralisation. The Government has dragged its heels on this issue for too long. It is giving An Post, the banks and so on the opportunity to leave rural areas. The Government published a spatial strategy, but it did not mention the towns to which decentralised Departments will go. The sooner it does so, the better. It is time the Government grasped the nettle in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">On the Order of Business today, two Members opposite referred to the heavy-handedness of Dúchas in recent times. An Taisce is a laudable organisation which does tremendous work, but it should adhere to its brief. As has been stated, it goes well beyond its brief on many occasions and the powers and undue influence it exercises, particularly in relation to the rural environment, need to be questioned by an Oireachtas committee or another body.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">I agree with the Minister's assertion that infrastructure is vital to rural areas and communities. As has been stated, roads are in place but water, sewerage and telecommunications infrastructure are required. If decentralisation was implemented and people knew where they stood, the above issues could be rectified. I agree with the Minister that a woman or man who moves their family to a rural area and sets up a business there is, in many ways, more valuable to a community than a small industry 40 or 50 miles away because a sense of community is created as a result of that person and others moving to the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I recently wrote to the Minister about elderly people living alone in rural areas. It has come to my attention that a number of the alarm units which people living in remote areas had installed cannot be repaired when they break down and must be replaced. I have been informed that the community alert schemes and St. Vincent de Paul, which provide this service, are still awaiting funding from the Department to replace these units. This is a question of life and death in terms of the security of many old people living in remote areas. Will the Minister investigate this problem? We all know many elderly people, even in urban areas, who require these units. I refer to my mother who is 85 years of age and who requires such a facility. It is something which should be acted on as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The Minister mentioned the RAPID programme, which relates to urban areas and deals with poverty and areas of disadvantage. I agree that population decline rather than poverty should be the criteria in rural areas. I have no doubt about the Minister's sincerity on this subject and I have listened to him on several occasions address the question of people living, working and being able to raise their children in the area they wish. It is incumbent on the Minister to come up with practical solutions and to take whatever action is necessary to allow people to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">I agree with Senator Ó Murchú in respect of Knock airport. The need for airports in rural areas and in the regions is of paramount importance. As far as Waterford is concerned, the south-east regional airport has had its difficulties recently. We need the same assistance the other regional airports get in order to compete on a level playing field. We have addressed that issue with other Ministers, but the problem has not yet been resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I wish the Minister well in an area which is close to his heart. I hope he will come up with practical solutions to deal with once-off housing, rural development and population decline.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_179">This is a timely discussion on the work of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and on rural areas and on the people who live there. One of the best schemes the Minister introduced was the CLÁR programme, which focused on areas that had suffered from population decline. He outlined the facts and figures to support his case. CLÁR was able to help areas and other schemes already in existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">I was interested in region ten, described in the CLÁR programme as north Galway, east Mayo and north-west Roscommon. In recent years, people in north Galway have found that the CLÁR programme, through the Minister's Department, has been of great assistance in regard to schemes already in existence – for example, sewerage and water schemes – and where sports capital grants were sought. I am glad the Minister announced recently that other areas will be included in the CLÁR programme. This is most welcome in areas where population levels have fallen.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">In the past, the Minister placed great emphasis on education and on small schools in rural areas. There were a number of one-teacher schools in County Galway which were in danger of closing. The Minister, in conjunction with the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, put forward a proposal to provide a minimum of two teachers to these schools which now have remedial and resource teachers and, through the FÁS programme, they had learning support teachers in the past. This has been of great benefit. We should look at other ways in which schools may be used. Many people have asked me why should a school close at 3 p.m. There are other uses to which schools could be put, including studying, child care and so on, and I hope the Minister will take that on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I am concerned about the postal service in rural areas, a matter about which I spoke to the Minister last week. It is difficult to know what constitutes a post office. In parts of Galway, post offices have been turned into agencies. It transpires that one cannot register a letter in an agency post office and, therefore, if a farmer wants to send off an area aid form he or she cannot do so in certain areas. Students who want to fill in CAO forms, which are important for those who wish to go to university, cannot do so at agency post offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">To confuse matters further, PostPoint, which allows people to pay bills and top up mobile phones, is not a post office, nor is it advertised as a post office. However, many supermarkets and big shops are availing of PostPoint. More importantly, if a post office closes, an advertisement is no longer placed in the newspaper seeking someone to take over the new service. These are important issues which must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">I spoke to the Minister last week about the village of Clonberne in north Galway where a post office closed and there was no advertisement in the media. To make matters worse, two other post offices in the same parish at Lavally and Cashel are also closing down. To lose three such centres in a small area makes matters difficult for people who were used to the service and wish to see it continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Another issue on which we must focus, and to which the Minister referred, is that of part-time farming. It is becoming more difficult to live and rear a family on a small farm. FÁS schemes have been of great benefit in the past, but, under the new regulations, it seems that from next April people who have worked for three years in these schemes can no longer continue do so. I would like that ceiling lifted. The matter will be the subject of much debate in the coming months because it gave many small farmers great opportunities to avail of an alternative income. In my area, people would have to travel approximately 40 or 50 miles to Galway city to obtain alternative employment. Given the amount of traffic on the roads, this is not practical.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">More FÁS schemes and opportunities for people to continue working must be considered because it would allow people to have sufficient contributions on reaching the age of 65 or 66 to get on to social welfare schemes. This year 5,000 people will be lost from FÁS schemes, but that loss may not be felt in some areas. Perhaps there could be some flexibility in regard to changing FÁS places to different areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The setting up of the new Department has been a great idea for which the Taoiseach and the Minister deserve much credit. One of the issues that will continue to arise in regard to rural areas is that of transport. There have been some very good initiatives in that regard in the past, particularly those put in place by the old Department of Social Welfare. Many schemes were established and social services in smaller towns have done an excellent job. I hope this will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">I would like to see more pilot schemes on transport. An initiative was introduced in the last budget to allow for improvements in this area. The use of school buses after school should be considered, including on bus routes operated by Bus Éireann. I have had many requests, which I put to Bus Éireann, concerning bus stops on certain routes, particularly those from Ballinasloe to Galway and Dublin to Galway. It is difficult to get flexibility on this issue. I do not understand, for example, why a bus route should be the same every day. Some people would like to have a bus service one or two days a week, but I have been told this cannot happen. These issues, including bus stops outside of towns, should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The Minister referred to infrastructure and other Senators spoke about water and sewerage schemes. A great deal of progress has been made in County Galway in regard to water. However, many villages do not benefit from sewerage schemes. Many detailed preliminary reports have been carried out by Galway County Council in relation to villages, most costing approximately €1 million. We received additional funding under CLÁR. However, it would be good value for money to provide sewerage schemes at approximately €1 million to €1,5 million, because huge amounts are being spent in cities and towns on sewerage and water treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Newspaper reports indicated that there was some disappointment in regard to the National Roads Authority announcement last week. The authority announced a €17 million investment for County Galway, including €1 million for the Loughrea bypass. It is significant that €1.2 million was allocated for a national secondary route, the N63. At a time when there is huge speculation about the type of new roads being provided, it is very welcome and significant that €1.2 million is being spent on a stretch of road from Turloughmore to the Ballygar border with Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I welcome the announcement of the national spatial strategy and the decentralisation programme, which I hope will be put in place in due course. I welcome in particular what has been said in regard to regional airports. We must also look at railways. The fact that a mile of road costs three times as much as a mile of rail means that railways have a great role to play. The former Minister, Senator O'Rourke, spoke about an expansion study which would cover, for example, railways from Mayo to Galway, south Galway to Galway and Athenry to Galway. I hope the Minister will consider an early commuter service from Ballinasloe to Galway. There is great potential for the railways and I hope the Minister will continue the good work he is doing in the Department.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_81">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_192">Fáiltím roimh an Aire. I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate. This issue should be on the agenda on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">From my perspective, the support structures for the west, in particular, have been disimproving. I listened to Senator Kitt and I am well aware of the excellent points he raised. Under the National Roads Authority's plans, during the course of the last year 75% of the road projects west of the Shannon were behind schedule, while 45% of road projects in the south and east of the country were ahead of schedule. That was the position last year and matters have become worse. I know that the National Roads Authority has to cut its cloth to suit its measure and to operate within certain constraints but the signal we are sending out as a society is that rural Ireland takes second place. This is utterly and grossly unacceptable and represents a kick in the teeth for the people of rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Gas is an important part of our infrastructure. The extension of gas pipelines to the west is crucially important for towns in that part of Ireland. The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, and I recently had an argument about these issues. Regardless of what was said on that occasion, I am worried by the recent Government statement that it intends to reconsider its plans to distribute gas to the west on the basis that it cannot, on balance, be done in an economic manner. If we are to discuss the provision of services and infrastructure in the west in economic terms, we might as well throw our hat at it now, as it will never happen. The west must be seen as part of Ireland. A square mile of County Mayo, County Kerry or County Galway must be considered to be as important as a square mile of County Kildare or County Dublin. If we look at the country in any other manner, we will lose out as there will not be balanced growth or development.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The Minister knows as well as I do that the issue of roads is a huge one, as he lives and travels in rural areas. I have heard him discuss the state of the roads on many occasions and know that he is as disgusted by it as I am. As a member of the Government, he does not have the freedom to say some of the things I have said. We must think about the roads one must travel if one wishes to transport fish from Dingle, Killybegs or Rossaveal to the ferry ports on the east coast. The fishing industry is a huge one but it is almost impossible to transport goods. Similarly, one must use dangerous roads to transport mushrooms from Belmullet to the market. These matters need to be considered in terms of investment in people.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The fact that BreastCheck facilities are not available in the west is devastating for people there. I mention this as Senators are asked in this debate to discuss rural development policy with particular reference to population decline. People will not live in areas that do not have good education and health facilities. I defy anybody to explain to normal people with a sense of equity the reason people living in Castlebar or Dún Chaoin cannot enjoy the same access to BreastCheck facilities as those in other parts of the country. I was in a larger country, with the same population, background and infrastructural problems as Ireland, last year. A state-of-the-art unit, containing an operating theatre and other equipment that could be used for health checks, that could be moved between various parts of the country had been established there. The unit was connected with the services provided by local hospitals. Surgeons travelled to regional centres to perform operations in the unit. People who did not need intensive care were looked after in local hospitals. Such a system would be an appropriate way of dealing with the problems in our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Fine towns in the west would benefit from decentralisation. I do not know the reason the Government has not decided to begin the next phase of the decentralisation process. I recently walked through Kilrush, a well built town with wide streets and solid infrastructure, a classic example of a location that has not received sufficient investment. I looked at its buildings with decentralisation in mind and decided that there was no reason a Department could not be located there tomorrow morning, as it had great potential. I could say the same thing about many other towns. I do not have a vested interest in this matter; I am not thinking of standing for election in Couny Clare, County Galway or County Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">I ask the Minister to listen to the points I have made. Members of the Government may believe they can ignore these issues but many fair-minded people living on the east coast would support a Government initiative on them. People cannot argue against investment in the west.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">I have heard the Minister discussing the development of tourism in the west on many occasions. The development of nature walks, treks and tracks has fallen behind that of other countries which have officially designated tracks. Such development is important as it helps us to show off our country at its best. There is no marina north of Galway on the west coast. Many argue that, with the north-west of France, the seas off the west coast are the most beautiful sailing areas in Europe. There are fine marinas in Fenit and Kilrush and one or two are to be built in County Galway. When I walked around Blacksod Bay recently, I saw a notice of application for planning permission for the development of a marina. I hope this project goes ahead. We should be attracting people who are interested in Ireland by putting in place quality tourism attractions that are environmentally friendly. I ask the Minister to examine this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">I wish to discuss the rail service. It could be argued that the Government has made certain choices in relation to the matters I have already mentioned but who made the decision not to provide a dining car on the Sligo train? I would like to meet the person who made that decision to ask him or her what is wrong with the people of the west that means they do not need to eat when they get on trains. What is the basis for treating passengers on the Sligo train differently? Who are the people who decided not to provide the dining car service? Surely an official of Iarnród Éireann, faced with the fact that there is a limited number of dining cars, would decide to distribute them in an equitable manner while the company is waiting for more to be delivered. I do not know the reason the people of the west tolerate such treatment – perhaps they have become too quiet.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">It is the intention of the National Roads Authority that cars will be able to travel between conurbations at an average speed of 80 kph, or 50 mph. Similarly, the Government should insist that all trains be capable of maintaining an average speed of 60 mph. People should be able to travel to Westport, Castlebar, Ballina, Sligo or Tralee by train in under three hours. It is worthwhile for users of the rail service to carry with them a list of the times of the last trains from Cork, Tralee, Limerick, Galway, Westport, Ballina and Sligo to Dublin.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_203">One cannot do a full day's work in such places as the last train departs before 6 p.m. in most cases – I think the last train from Cork leaves at about 7 p.m. Such a timetable is ridiculous in this day and age, as it means expensive infrastructure lies idle. It should not be allowed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">This country would gain a great deal from investment in conference facilities in attractive places like the Chair's constituency. County Galway is quite well served in terms of such facilities. Given that Knock Airport is in place, all that is needed is a proper train service to the west to develop it as a conference location. Many hotels are providing conference services – fair play to them – but we need national investment in other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The worst and oldest carriages are used on trains that serve the western lines. If I lived in that region, I would stand on the track at Kingsbridge and not allow a train to move until I had met the people who made that decision.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_207">It is time for the west to wake up and stop tolerating being treated like second-class citizens by people who never have to travel in such poor conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I have raised the importance of broadband infrastructure on many occasions. I am glad that the Minister is taking lessons on the development of e-government. I compliment the Government on the fact that it expects to run Cabinet meetings electronically very shortly. I welcome such a progressive move which reflects well on the members of the Government. Similarly imaginative steps should be taken in the west.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Towns like Castlebar have made huge advances in terms of new technology. Ennis is the leading town in Ireland in this area, but many towns, including Ennis, Castlebar and Galway, have put a lot of investment into this and need ICT infrastructure support. Money must be put into broadband because current investment is inadequate. Privatisation was a major mistake and it should have been a condition of any buyout that up-to-date facilities would be made available. In the era in which we live, the west can be as close to the centre of the action as Wall Street if people have the necessary ICT facilities coming into their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Tá sé ráite agus sean-ráite agam leis an Aire gurb iad seo na deacrachtaí atá ag muintir na nGaeltachtaí. Brathaim i gcónái nach bhfuil tacaíocht ar leith ag dul do mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí. Tá dearcadh agus polasaithe an Stáit dírithe orthu siúd atá ag labhairt cúpla focal Gaeilge lasmuigh des na Gaeltachtaí. Tá sin i bhfad níos tábhachtaí don Stát ná tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh siúd atá ins na Gaeltachtaí, i dtobar na teanga. Ba chóir go mbeadh tacaíocht ar fáil dóibh.</p>

Níl na seirbhísí ar fad le fáil acu ina dteanga féin agus tá seo i bhfad níos tábhachtaí ná aon rud eile.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Tá na Gaeltachtaí i bhfad níos tábhachtaí ná an teanga féin. Is seod de chultúr na tíre iad na Gaeltachtaí, even if people never speak the Irish language. Is daoine ann féin iad muintir na nGaeltachtaí a bhfuil dearcadh dá gcuid féin acu agus a bhfuil a lán acu le tabhairt dúinn. Ina measc féin creideann siad nach bhfuil siad chomh tábhachtach mar shaoránaigh ná a lán daoine eile ar an dtaobh eile den tír. Ba chóir go mbeadh níos mó tacaíochta á thabhairt dóibh.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Tá a fhios agam go n-aontaíonn an t-Aire liom sa mhéad seo. Tá a lán daoine ann, agus nílim ag trácht ar na heagrais teanga, a bheadh sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt do mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí. Tá sin ráite go minic ag an Seanadóir Ó Murchú. Tá tábhacht na nGaeltachtaí i bhfad níos mó ná tábhacht na teanga féin, cé go bhfuil an teanga tábhachtach chomh maith.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">In bringing those issues together, we need to look closely at the way people live their lives in the west and in other rural areas in the context of health facilities and education. I made a point of not speaking on education today as I have done so on many previous occasions, but it comes into this discussion with regard to the question of schools, school transport and other matters. We need to look at people, where they live and the infrastructure they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The last point I wish to raise is one on which I know the Minister and I are of one mind – ar aon aigne. That is the policy on tithíocht, or housing. The Minister has articulated his views on housing, particularly single housing, and those views should be brought quickly into legislation or implementable policy. That is something Members on all sides of the House could contribute to, and it should be done in a brave and straightforward manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I realise that I went over the top on the previous occasion I spoke about this matter in the House in having a go at some of the people in the great organisation that is supposed to look after the development of the environment and built environment. I accept that those people can do both good and bad things, but much of what they are doing at present is demoralising for the development of communities in rural Ireland. As politicians and elected public representatives, we should say that loudly, clearly and without inhibition. I support the Minister in moving those matters forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">I welcome the Minister who has taken an enlightened approach to the subject of rural development policy, particularly with regard to the problem of population decline in rural areas. While I lack the objectivity Senator O'Toole displayed in identifying Kilrush as a centre to which a number of Departments should be transferred, I would be delighted to discuss this matter with him and perhaps we could plan a campaign along those lines.</p>

        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_219">For too long, the rural parts of Ireland have experienced a brain drain, with the brightest and best from all over the country moving to the big towns and cities. That is where the jobs are and where people have had to go for further education. Many Members were part of that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">There is a significant cost to society, particularly in rural areas, as a result of these necessities. Rural areas are dying a slow death; the rural community is haemorrhaging and there is no sign of this stopping. That is what the discussion should be about. I listened to the Minister's speech with great interest. I have no doubt that he is committed to ensuring that this decline stops, but it is incumbent on everyone in the House and outside to become involved in that active debate. I agree with Senator O'Toole that this is something we should discuss on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The statistics from the census of 2002 show the scale of the problem. One need only look at the figures represented on a map to realise the staggering effect of depopulation since the previous census. This is a disturbing fact and we should bear it in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The west has experienced some of the greatest decline in population and County Clare, in particular, has experienced acute problems. Large rural areas of County Clare have experienced a drop in population. For example, the population of Carn dropped by 16%, Mount Elva by 24%, Kilmaley by 9% and Mullagh by 10.5%. That decline can be contrasted with the Ennis urban region, which has seen an increase in population of some 24%. The figures indicate the scale of the problem with regard to County Clare, but other counties along the western seaboard have had a similar experience and the Leas-Chathaoirleach will have seen major decline in his area as the population moves towards Galway city.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">There is a real problem in rural communities and steps must be taken to counteract it. While the Government should be commended for the national development plan, the national spatial strategy – we are well aware of the Minister's involvement in that – and the steps being put in place to reverse the continuing drift of the population towards Dublin and the surrounding areas, we need to take greater steps to keep our rural communities intact.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The Minister referred to culture and the changing of mindsets, which is important, but there is a need for funding. I liked the Minister's analogy about the chicken and the egg and the necessity to put infrastructure in place first. The overriding concern is the provision of money and the Department of Finance will have to grapple with that to ensure that not just infrastructure but necessary services and facilities are put in place to assist the development of communities and ensure that the decline so evident at present does not continue. How can people be expected to stay in rural areas when Government spending seems to be concentrated on the east?</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Senator Kitt referred to the announcement from the NRA. I would not have been as positive as the Senator because a disproportionate amount of that investment was for the east coast. There are reasons for this arising from the different stages a number of projects are at. It is incumbent on us to ensure State agencies responsible for developing the infrastructure are properly biased in their approach. It is also important to ensure the necessary resources are provided to ensure the principle of balanced regional development is adhered to. This will set the tone for the other stockholders and ensure a change in culture and mindset. As politicians, we must grasp the nettle and ensure it is not merely a question of lip service. It comes down to money.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">There is a need to reduce the economic deficit experienced by rural regions. This can only happen through a programme aimed at reducing the economic marginalisation of rural communities. Life must be made attractive for people living in rural areas to ensure they do not follow their brothers, sisters and others who have left. There is also a necessity to encourage people to return home. Having spent a number of years studying and working in Dublin, I returned to a rural community. Being involved in politics it may have been easier for me to do this. One form of encouragement is the absence of the traffic chaos in Dublin and other cities to which the Minister referred. This needs to be built on.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Given the difficulties with securing planning permission, it is not surprising that young people are moving away from rural communities on which Senator Ó Murchú elaborated. While the Minister has also made statements on the issue, the problems in this area are not being adequately addressed. Some of the policies and county development plans must be re-examined. National and local politics are involved. Local authorities tend to place the onus for resolving problems on the Government, yet at the same time many continue to develop county development plans that are not well thought through. The identification of industrial zones within rural areas is an example.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The Minister referred to the changing nature of farming. While it must be accepted that the agricultural base of rural communities is being eroded and while the protection of family farms is a priority, there is an evident necessity for off-farm income. Securing that income can be problematic, especially if it means the necessity to travel 60 or 70 miles to take up employment. This does not bode well for the retention of rural populations. A mind shift is required to ensure local industries can develop in designated areas which will create the necessary backup in terms of services and employment opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Over the life cycle of the Celtic tiger the disadvantages of living in large urban areas have become apparent. There is now the opportunity and the capacity to make it attractive for people not only to stay in rural areas but also to move back. It is, therefore, essential for us and the relevant Departments to ensure the necessary funding is provided to allow for this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_230">I was reminded of the return of the old romantic by the Minister's references to aspects of rural Ireland that have regrettably long since disappeared. If I believed he and his Department and the other relevant Departments had begun to deal with the aspects of rural development he espouses, I would consider his appointment as Minister with responsibility for this area to be justified and overdue. Unfortunately, however, while he highlighted many aspects of rural Ireland that are in decline, nothing has been done to stem the exodus from the countryside. For example, earlier today, on the 1 o'clock news on the radio, I heard of another example of how bureaucracy in the form of European Union legislation had denied a farming couple the opportunity to enhance their income in a small way by engaging in value added activities on their farm. They have had to close their small industry. It is regrettable that such incidents continue to happen because of the need to implement EU directives. When the Minister ensures legitimate efforts to improve rural farm incomes are recognised and allowed, we will recognise that he has made an impact on his Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">I do not doubt the Minister's intentions. One of his early initiatives related to the CLÁR programme. While the programme is not a new development – the Minister has used it to his political advantage in his constituency – it can be of great benefit to many rural communities which are suffering population decline. I welcome his initiative in extending the programme to other areas and widening its application.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The Minister has identified areas that have suffered population decline. They are widespread throughout rural Ireland, especially in the west, including his constituency. If areas of designation, such as those under the European Union habitats directive, are superimposed on CLÁR programme areas, it will be clear that the aims of designation and the programme are incompatible. For example, 25% or more of County Galway is designated and this is set to accelerate. Rural communities in County Mayo are protesting about their inclusion in areas of designation, while recently there were similar protests by communities on the banks of the River Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Has the Minister forgotten that he gave an undertaking to compensate those who, on their own initiative, took on board schemes for the protection of habitats before there was ever a directive from the European Union or anybody to monitor the effectiveness of such a directive? What happened to the people concerned? They were left high and dry – that is a pun – especially those concerned with the Callows in the Shannon Basin. They were left stranded without any recognition of what they had taken on. There was no response from Government by way of compensation and the Minister has not come forward with any.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">We debated agriculture last week in the Seanad but there has been no long-term, focused policy of any kind on agriculture in recent years. There have been <i>ad hoc</i> responses to a series of crises during the years, and compensation may have been granted in some areas. Being seen to respond to a certain crisis when it occurs is not indicative of policy development. If we go down that road, we will never have a new, vibrant rural community, regardless of what one does.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">With regard to industrial policy and job creation, do I have to remind the Minister that Ballinasloe in County Galway was rocked in recent days by the sensation that the last flagship in the town was to suffer the loss of 387 jobs? This affected both a rural and an urban community. If we expect rural communities will be enhanced in any way by the IDA, the one industrial body we have charged with the responsibility of bringing industry to the regions, we will be disappointed. I have worked for 25 years in Ballinasloe where not one IDA-assisted job has been created in that period. The glib response of the Tánaiste was that those affected should go to Galway or Athlone, where there are jobs. This response is totally unworthy of any Minister charged with the responsibility of creating jobs for a population that has suffered severe job losses. Task forces were created but there was no adequate response.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Enterprise Ireland has recognised the need for jobs and delivered some to our indigenous industry. However, the county and city enterprise boards are the only agencies to which ordinary people can gain access in order to acquire money to support their initiatives. Every day entrepreneurs find the wall getting higher and higher because of red tape preventing their initiatives coming to fruition. That is a serious indictment of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">On the question of policy, it is worrying if the Government intends to rationalise all the relevant agencies. What has it done with the Western Development Commission? It has demoralised all its initiatives. The Leader programme has been strangled. While the Government is acting in this matter, we will not have any communities flourishing in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Teagasc is the agricultural training and research agency. Today in Dublin a seminar group was told that young people did not want to become involved in agricultural education. Soon, no young people will follow on from their parents. A speaker at the seminar gave an example of one young man in Cork who had not one acre of land, yet he was farming 2,000 acres. That is what will happen in rural County Galway unless the Minister prevents it.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">We must stop, once and for all, the creeping paralysis of designation that is stifling rural areas. The Minister said he was the person who had become identified with the point of view of those who stood for the single rural house. I know where he is coming from and support him on the stand he has taken but let us not forget that we will be in serious difficulties until he gets his Government colleague to erase from the spatial strategy the word "sustainability". This is because the Government's interpretation of sustainability with regard to the provision of services for a rural, stand-alone house is quite different from mine and that of the Minister and many other local authority members. The Minister is paying lip service and using welcome jargon but, despite having espoused certain policies, he will charge up the stairs in Dáil Éireann in support of the very terms that are crucifying rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I welcome what the Minister has said, although some of his comments are outdated. We are looking forward to stemming the flow and to a brighter future. There is no indication that the Government has focused policies. I do not know if the Minister has the capacity to wrench from his colleague, the Minister for Finance, any supportive mechanisms that will sustain a rural population.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">I compliment the work of the National Rural Development Forum. It is important that the finances are given to the Minster to implement the plans prioritised in the White Paper. Agriculture and rural development were mentioned in the report of the Minister. I am glad to see that €8.5 billion will be available over the next seven years to implement the plans therein. It is important that the maximum possible number of agricultural families continue on the land and that the early retirement and installation aid schemes are kept in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I agree with my colleague, Senator Ó Murchú, on the point he made regarding rural housing. It is very important to implement sustainable development policies to facilitate housing in rural areas where a housing need is established. Of all our infrastructural needs, none is greater than the housing need of rural communities. I compliment the work carried out by voluntary housing bodies over the past ten years. They have catered well for the needs of rural communities and, please God, will play a leading role in the future. If their spirit can be harnessed in the implementation of a rural development plan, we will succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">It is important that the tourism industry receives its fair share of finances. I compliment the work carried out under the national spatial strategy and disagree with Senator Ulick Burke's interpretation of the matter. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has said, quite rightly, that rural one-off houses are included in the strategy. That is very important. I am sure the Minister will clarify the position in the very near future. It is time for action and for all agencies to work together. Local authorities, county development boards and enterprise boards must implement the plans which are in place. I wish the Minister every success in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I am very grateful for the opportunity to make a couple of points. I draw the attention of Members to public frustration at the slow pace of infrastructural development in rural areas. That was reflected in the number of Independent Deputies returned at the last general election. One was elected in Monaghan and two in the west. Connacht is perhaps the region most isolated from the infrastructure of our cities.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">The Minister is sincere and wants to develop rural Ireland, but he has been ambiguous and I disagree with him on some points. Having been a public servant and close to Government, I understand that Ministers are the people who make the changes. In the last part of his speech, the Minister noted that it is not enough for politicians to develop policies since Government Departments cannot implement them unless mindsets change. It is our leaders, the politicians, who are the ones who must change mindsets. They are there to create a vision and to lead. The Minister should not wait for various bodies to get their acts together. They will not do that unless they are led politically by particular Ministers in particular Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Without mentioning names, there are many examples of major changes in this city which were the result of the visions of certain politicians whose reputations are somewhat compromised. Senators know who I mean. Change took place because the drive was there.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">Mr. Haughey had a vision for the country and it is unfortunate for him that things went wrong. I am not justifying anything, but he had a vision for economic development and he had the guts in 1987 to establish what was necessary to get the economy right.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">An Taisce has got itself off side with Government and decision makers by concentrating on the issue of one-off housing in rural areas. That needs to be sorted out. Those who want to live in one-off housing in the countryside should be allowed to live where they want and An Taisce should be brought into the mainstream of decision making. Its aspirations are my aspirations.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The greater Dublin area is home to 40% of the population, up from 32% in 1961. We want no more than 25% of future development to take place in this region. It is crazy to have dormitory homes 15 or 20 miles outside the city to which people travel late at night after work and from which they speed at the weekend. That is not a natural way to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Senator McHugh spoke eloquently about returned emigrants. I draw the attention of the House to economic immigrants, some of whom work in my own company. They sustained the Celtic tiger when there was no unemployment and they make an exotic contribution to our economy. We are getting the cream of eastern Europe and the Baltic states. They are charming, brilliantly educated and very polished and they remind me of our emigrants in that they have drive and energy and they want to get on. They will stay here and have families, while many of our returning emigrants are coming back from exotic places with wives and husbands. In Colombia last week I met a young Irish man who has been there for five years and will be bringing his Colombian wife home to live in Ennis. I told her that she will be very welcome, that she will add to the exotica and had better learn English properly. In 50 years time this will be a different country from the one we know. It delights me that there will be people in Government whose grandparents were born in eastern Europe, the Baltic states or Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I received a call on Friday from an independent councillor, Valerie Byrne from Elphin, County Roscommon. Elphin is a village of 750 people and its community college does not have enough classrooms, forcing the children to go to the grammar school in the town for certain classes during the day. They get wet and cold as they go to and from classes and she has asked me to ascertain the status of an extension for the community college. The economic viability of Elphin is affected by the current state of affairs because children are being sent to school in Strokestown, Carrick-on-Shannon and Boyle. This means parents will do their shopping in these towns rather than in Elphin. The Minister in his speech said that community leaders rather than developers should be the decision makers in rural areas and praise is due to Valerie Byrne for putting pressure on Government to secure an extension for her local school.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I realise the Minister is sincere and I was asked to convey warm regards to him from people in the North last week. He supported people on both sides during the troubles. However, there is one point which I must take up with him. It is a pity he said that the man or woman who decides to move their family to the countryside to set up in business is, in many ways, much more valuable to that community than a multinational which sets up in the nearest city 40 or 50 miles away. The Minister should not have said that, rather he should have equated the two. It is not true that such a man or woman is more valuable. Entrepreneurial, craft, intellectual and IT skills are brought by multinationals. Where would the country be if we had opted for the Buchanan report in 1972? Since he is a community leader, I would like the Minister to rephrase his statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_103" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_265">I agree with much that Senator White and many other Senators have said. I welcome the Minister to the House. He has an important portfolio and I wish him well. Like most of the other speakers, I have been encouraged by what the Minister has said since he took office. His heart is in the right place and he is a man who knows what rural affairs are all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I find it ironic that the Minister mentioned the future importance of organic farming at a time when doubt is being cast on the agricultural college in Athenry, which promotes such farming techniques. Organic farming is significant and deserves additional funding rather than less. In addition, Teagasc is to close down the country's main research centre for soft fruit, in Clonroche, due to funding cutbacks. I urge the Minister to intervene to keep both these centres open.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The Minister referred to one-off housing in rural areas and I support the thrust of what he said. Inevitably, however, it comes down to a question of interpretation by local authority planners as to whether or not an application will be accepted. As a county councillor I am well aware of that, as are other Members of the House who are also councillors. Regardless of what the Minister may say at national level, it still comes down to a local planner's decision. Planners are individuals and while one person may read something into a development plan, another may read the same plan months or even years later and see something completely different.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I have a problem with the inconsistencies in planning laws as they apply to Kilkenny. On the one hand, we see developments that many people would question, while on the other, a proposed development by a local person to live on their own land can be turned down by the planning authority. If we are serious about resolving such difficulties we will have to introduce a degree of consistency to local authority planning decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The Minister made a number of positive statements to which I have referred but it is now time for action on these issues. Like my colleague, Senator Ulick Burke, I have not seen many concrete proposals in the Minister's speech for the future development of rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">In common with other Senators, I am concerned about a number of local issues. I read with interest a report in a Sunday newspaper, which I can only presume was a targeted leak by somebody in the Department of Health and Children. According to the report, a proposal is being considered to close the maternity facilities at St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny and transfer them to the regional hospital in Waterford. A similar proposal is being considered for the maternity wards in south Tipperary and Wexford, with a view to bringing all of them together in a central facility in Waterford. From the viewpoint of developing rural communities that would be a retrograde step. It is only two years since the maternity unit was opened in St. Luke's Hospital, so the facilities there are modern and it would make no sense to transfer it, along with neighbouring maternity facilities, to Waterford. Some 6,000 babies are born every year in the south east and it is not feasible for Waterford Regional Hospital to deal with that number.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The issue of single men living in pre-fabricated accommodation in rural areas may not come under the aegis of the Minister's Department, but I wish to raise it anyway. Such men are living in south Kilkenny and I am sure it is similar in the Minister's constituency of west Galway. Many of them are in their 50s or early 60s and most work as farm labourers but they are living in Third World conditions. This is unacceptable. The Minister could deal with this matter and make an impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Members of local authorities are familiar with such situations when it comes to allocating council houses. Local authorities build three or four-bedroom houses but one cannot expect middle-aged, single men to be given such housing if a family is in need of it. We must seriously examine the accommodation problems that these men face because they have been overlooked by various Governments. The Minister should examine this matter during his term of office.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The level of grants for the upkeep of thatched houses is a problem in south Kilkenny. A few weeks ago I was contacted by an elderly gentleman who had availed of a grant to have his dwelling rethatched. Given the current cost of such work these days, however, the grant is too small and it needs to be increased significantly. The gentleman who contacted me lives alone with no family to support him, and also has thatched outhouses in a yard. He has been unable to obtain assistance to help meet the cost of rethatching those buildings. If the roofs fall in they will have to be replaced with more modern materials. The Minister should examine the grant levels for repairing thatched roofs. These are not confined to the west; it is a national rural issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Many speakers referred earlier in the debate to decentralisation and for some time New Ross has been seeking a Government Department to be relocated there. According to a recent report in a national newspaper, decisions about decentralisation may be put back until after the local elections next year. We know that such decisions were delayed until after last year's general election for political reasons, but I would hate to think that once again for political benefit the issue will not be tackled because decentralisation can bring many benefits to provincial towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I agree with Senator Ó Murchú about the role of An Taisce, particularly concerning one-off rural housing. As he rightly pointed out, An Taisce is a prescribed organisation so the idea that it would refuse membership to people whose views differ from its own is objectionable. The sooner An Taisce's role within the planning process is sorted out the better for everyone concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Both the Minister and An Taisce are in favour of the development of villages and I wish to raise the case of Kilmacow, a village in south Kilkenny about six miles from Waterford city. Some 30 years ago the idea of developing a sewerage scheme for the village was first mooted, yet to date no action has been taken to provide such a scheme. This is despite the fact that Kilmacow's population has increased dramatically in the intervening 30 years. It is now impossible to obtain planning permission in Kilmacow, Mooncoin and neighbouring villages throughout south Kilkenny due to the lack of a viable sewerage system. Villages are an integral part of rural life and if they are to be developed in future we will have to provide basic facilities such as water and sewerage, for which additional funding should be made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">I wish the Minister well in his important portfolio. In common with the Minister, I represent a rural constituency which is close to my heart. I detected a sense of fatalism about the future of agriculture from speeches by the Minister and Government Senators, but we should not be fatalistic about it. If we are serious about rural development in the future, agriculture must play a very vital part in that development. There has to be a sustainable future for people so that families can earn a living from the land. I hope the Minister will be able to influence his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to take action in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I have one further point to make about An Taisce. As a rural dweller, I am annoyed at the views held by some urban dwellers who travel out to rural Ireland at the weekend, see the green fields and want the landscape to remain that way. If the rural lifestyle and communities are to survive there must be people living within those communities and it is the Minister's job to ensure this. It is a tough job and I do not envy the Minister his task, but I hope that he will be able to breathe new life back into those communities during his term of office.</p>

          <from>Mr. Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_279">I will be brief because I know that the House is pressed for time. I wish to share my time with Senator Leyden. I welcome the Minister to the House and commend his work over the past two years. There is no Minister with a better understanding of rural Ireland and its problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The Minister introduced the CLÁR programme for areas that have suffered serious depopulation over the years. Thanks to that programme there are small group water and sewerage schemes being installed which have made a great difference to those areas earmarked for the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I come from the north-west, from a small town in the very south of County Sligo. That town stood still for most of my childhood and even up to ten years ago. The rural renewal scheme was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government of the time and in the past four years over 200 houses have been built in my town. At least another 200 houses are being planned and hopefully those houses will be built before the end of the scheme in 2004. It takes far-sighted projects such as these to sustain rural towns, particularly the small towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">It is crucial that people are allowed to build houses in rural areas. I agree with Senator John Paul Phelan that different planners have different ideas and there does not seem to be consistency. I am aware, as I am sure all politicians are, of planning applications which are refused for different reasons. I acknowledge that scenic areas are important and should be preserved but it is more important to ensure that the people of the rural areas are granted planning permission to build houses. Their children will then go to the local schools and the sporting organisations will be supported within the areas. There will be no hope for rural Ireland without the people. Provided that the sewerage systems and the roads can bear it, people should be allowed build in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I agree that decentralisation of Government Departments from the cities would help cities, where people cannot easily travel to work because of traffic congestion. It would also make a difference to the rural areas. I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_284">I welcome the Minister to the House and I congratulate him on the excellent work he has carried out since his appointment last year. It must be particularly rewarding for the Minister to see the realisation of many of the projects which he worked on when he was Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Minister recently visited the constituency of Roscommon and was shown the benefits of the CLÁR programme in the case of a small sewerage scheme in Ballinameen. Roscommon County Council, the Department and local developers between them built the integrated sewerage scheme. It has revitalised the village, which is close to Boyle, and new housing has now been built in the area. Combined with the tax concession in the Shannon corridor, it has made Ballinameen a focal point for redevelopment and regeneration. It is the ancestral area of President Mary McAleese. The Minister also visited Deerpark in Boyle where an extension of the sewerage scheme is being developed which will allow for housing in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The extension of the CLÁR area was very welcome. I ask the Minister to reconsider the situation regarding the town of Castlerea which is not included in the CLÁR area. People find it remarkable that towns like Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon are included in the CLÁR area but Castlerea is not. The town has suffered serious job losses but recent announcements of new jobs are very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The Minister recently extended the CLÁR area to include an area called Four Roads, which is just a few miles from Roscommon town. We are now losing our post office in Four Roads and it will be run on an agency basis. The very week in which the Minister was trying to revitalise that area, An Post decided to allow the owner of the premises, the postmaster, to avail of redundancy. He is entitled to avail of any such offer and it is not fair that he should be put in that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">An Post is closing post offices by stealth, by offering a sweetener to existing postmasters and then running the post office on an agency basis. It lowers the status of an area when a school, a Garda station or a post office is closed. The post office in Four Roads is now run on an agency basis. I ask the Minister and his Department to enter into consultation with An Post to ensure that the strategic locations of post offices in rural areas are retained. We appreciate that it is difficult to maintain every post office but those of strategic importance should be supported. The Minister is trying to revitalise rural Ireland and An Post, a State agency, is trying to take services away.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I ask the Minister and his Department to investigate the situation thoroughly and ensure that the maximum number of post offices is retained. I ask that his Department work with An Post to work out a financial package which would upgrade the offices and provide additional services such as computerisation, so that they are viable and more customer friendly.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">I wish the Minister well in his brief. The roads have now been resurfaced in a place called Cloonlarge outside Kilteevan, thanks to money from the CLÁR programme. Kilroosky and other areas have also benefited.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_298">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to the House. I welcome this Bill but I have a concern in regard to the area of penalties for breaches of the legislation. I understand that the penalty for failure to make a return will be only €2,500 and if somebody makes a fraudulent return it will be about €6,000 or €7,000. Those sums are not significant enough for people who do not abide by the law. The Government should consider providing for higher fines.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The legislation is complex and lengthy. No doubt, much work has been put into it by the officers in the Department of Finance. I congratulate them on this worthy document.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_300">The prime utility of a Bill of this kind is for tax practitioners to advise their clients. I was disappointed to hear today at an informal briefing on the Finance Bill by Department officials that this Bill will be amended again almost as soon as it is passed. This is for technical procedural reasons. They are across the board amendments that apply to all taxes to do with admissibility of claims for repayment. I suggest that when those amendments are made a simple addendum be added to the Bill, so that it is still all together for practitioners and is not out of date almost as soon as it is passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I wish to make a few general comments about capital acquisitions tax. In general we have a mild regime compared to most other countries. One area affects rural Ireland particularly, the case of farms. Farms do not always pass from father to son or daughter. They can be passed to brothers, nephews, cousins and so on. While there is provision for a favourite nephew, or niece these days, I am not sure it covers all cases. I remember from my days in the tax strategy group that quite a heavy part of the yield from capital acquisitions tax comes from transfers within the wider family. Obviously, the State needs money but it would help families if some latitude were allowed and the situation eased a little.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Those of us who were around in the 1980s remember great political debates between parties as to how capital and corporation tax yield could be improved. Those on the left of the political spectrum were particularly interested in those improvements. In 1986 capital taxes raised about £34 million. In the Estimate for this year it is over £800 million or €1,100. One of the biggest successes we have had, partly through reduction in the rates but also through general improvements in the economy, is that we now get a substantial contribution from capital and corporation tax. A lot of services would not be running if we did not have the yield we now have from these taxes. I welcome this Bill as a means of more efficient administration of these taxes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_114">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_303">My apologies for being late. I want to make a few general remarks about capital acquisition tax. They may came from a somewhat more nuanced perspective than others. Two or three years ago, during a break in the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill, the Minister turned to me and said he did not really understand why we were having the debate because he did not believe in inheritance tax and Deputy McDowell – as I then was – did not believe in inheritance. In a sense he was right, at least on the fundamental level.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The current Minister does not believe that we should, as he sees it, double tax people's income. He thinks that once they have earned something, they are entitled to do with it as they wish, be it endow their children or whatever else. My view is that inheritance is the way by which privilege and ownership of property cascade through the generations and effectively our class based system is maintained. Over time both of us have accommodated ourselves to various realities which has brought us closer than the distance between those two extremes.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">I now accept that those who earn money, build up wealth and accumulate property expect, at least in part, to be able to pass it on to their children. I assume that at this stage the Minister accepts that there should be some contribution to the Exchequer from inheritance or capital acquisitions. While we disagree on matters of less fundamental principle, there are still very significant differences between the view of the Government and mine. I believe agricultural relief to be excessive, to say the least, but accept that this is of long standing and the Minister is not the one responsible for its introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">We need to widen the gap between gift tax and inheritance tax. In dealing with business and property generally, particularly economic assets such as farms, we should be actively seeking to encourage people to gift them to children at an earlier stage. If it is done before death, they can be used, in most cases, more productively than they might otherwise have been. We need to look again at the provision by which children can now inherit several hundred thousand euro in addition to the family home if they have been living there, which amounts to a great deal before tax becomes payable. We should also look at the provision whereby spouses can inherit anything at all. This should be limited to assets and property, of which the couple had enjoyment in common in order that business or economic assets would not benefit from the exemption.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I welcome the Bill which does nothing in terms of the matters to which I have referred as it is not designed for that purpose. I appreciate that this type of consolidation is a difficult job of work. Those responsible for it in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to our thanks. I am quite sure that tax practitioners, in particular, will be grateful to them. I am aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated that he wants to consolidate criminal law, which I also accept will be a difficult task, but that Department appears to have been less successful to date in its endeavours in this regard. It is important that such information as we are dealing with here is kept up to date and available in all possible forms, electronic and otherwise. Since it is a technical and consolidation Bill I have no difficulty with it. I appreciate that the Minister of State has allowed me some time.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">I am glad that his view and that of the Minister have matured during the years, although they still continue to differ. The Bill consolidates the law relating to capital acquisitions tax which is contained in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act 1976 and provisions in subsequent Finance Acts. The new consolidation Bill continues the very successful process of the ongoing modernisation of the tax code. In 1997 the Taxes Consolidation Act consolidated the direct taxes legislation dealing with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. In 1999 the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act consolidated the stamp duties legislation. In addition, the consolidation and modernisation of general excise law on mineral oils were included in the Finance Act 1999 and the consolidation and modernisation of general excise law were included in the Finance Act 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">The preparatory process for consolidating capital acquisitions tax followed the same rigorous process as was adopted previously. The aim at all times was to ensure the most accurate consolidation of the existing law, with nothing left out and nothing added. This is what has been achieved in this Bill which was considered by the parliamentary counsel's office and has been duly certified as a consolidation of existing law by the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">What Senators have before them today is the culmination of over two years work. Perhaps the greatest benefit which will result from this consolidation will be the restructuring of the capital acquisitions tax code in a clear, coherent and logical way. This will make it more accessible and user-friendly for all users, including Members of the Oireachtas, who have to cope with annual changes to the capital acquisitions tax legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I appreciate the way in which this House assisted in the speedy passage of the Bill. It is important that it is enacted before Committee Stage of the Finance Bill 2003 as any subsequent changes to capital acquisitions tax will be slotted in to it by amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I express my own and the Government's appreciation of the amount of work which went into the preparation of the Bill. The staff of the Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary counsel's office are to be congratulated on a job well done. I also thank Senators for their consideration of the Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_319">I am speaking this evening on behalf of the Minister for Finance who is attending the ECOFIN meeting in Brussels today.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I very much welcome this motion which endorses the recent measures introduced by the Government to improve the management of public expenditure and underlines the need for continuing effective control of public expenditure in 2003. In my address I will outline the context within which this debate should be approached, as well as dealing with a range of issues relating to the management of the public finances and, in particular, the management and control of public expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Following a prolonged period of unprecedented economic growth, we now face a more difficult economic environment. Given the nature of our open economy, the prolonged slowdown in global activity has had a major impact. Data for the first nine months of 2002 show an average GNP increase of 1.4% compared to an increase of over 5% for the same period in 2001. As in other developed countries, the lower than anticipated economic growth has created a new environment for budgetary policy. It was this environment which informed the necessarily more restrictive approach adopted in budget 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">It is important in this context that I correct some misinformed comment made in relation to budget 2003 and particularly the Government's handling of public expenditure. An often repeated erroneous claim is that the tighter budgetary stance adopted in relation to public expenditure in 2003 was because of budgetary profligacy by the Government in earlier years. The record proves this to be a wrong suggestion. In reality over the period 1997 to 2002 the Government and its predecessor ran up accumulated Exchequer surpluses of €6 billion. It reduced the debt-GDP ratio from 65% to 34%. In a notable act of prudence and budgetary foresight it established the national pensions reserve fund to help provide for the major pensions burden which will face the State in the coming years. Commentators have questioned the level of improved services we have secured for this investment. It is undoubtedly true that we must try at all times to ensure optimal value for money for investment funded by taxpayers and I will refer to this and other expenditure management issues shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">We must, however, deal with reality rather than perception. The reality is that massive increases in investment in the health and education sectors have facilitated a significant expansion in the range of services in these sectors, that the rollout under the national development plan of capital projects is unprecedented in size and scale and that there has been a real increase of 41% in the level of social welfare expenditure since 1997. We have, therefore, real and tangible achievements to show for our recent levels of public investment. The challenge going forward in a much less benign environment is to continue to invest in our public services in a prioritised way and within a sustainable budgetary framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The need for a more restrictive approach to public expenditure in 2003, coupled with the inflexible nature of much of our public spending, underlines the real challenge in bringing about a reduction, in a balanced and fair way, in the scale of increases seen in recent years. This difficulty was referred to by the independent Estimates review committee – the three wise men – in its report on the 2003 Estimates. In light of this, the Department of Finance is committed to undertaking a medium-term review of spending over the coming months which will allow Government to review and assess its overall priorities over the next three to four year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The Government did not embark on a strict approach to public spending in 2003 simply because it wanted to balance the books. The EU stability and growth pact requires us to keep the general Government finances close to balance or in surplus and to take corrective action when there is an actual or expected divergence from this objective. We made it clear in An Agreed Programme for Government that we would respect this sovereign commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">We also have responsibilities to the Irish people. We have a responsibility to protect the economy and to foster conditions which will maintain high levels of employment and generate the resources which we need to keep improving our public services. If this requires difficult decisions in the short term we are willing to take those decisions. We take these responsibilities seriously. The lessons of the past have shown us that high taxation rates and high levels of borrowing do not deliver the economic and employment growth levels of recent years. We cannot repeat the mistake of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Looking at the economic prospects for 2003, the international outlook, which is critical to Ireland's open economy, remains characterised by uncertainty. At budget time last December we expected that growth would be modest this year, at 2.5% in GNP terms and 3.5% in GDP terms. However, the global economic and political outlook is shrouded in doubt and the risks to all economic forecasts are, therefore, on the downside. The difficulties in the Middle East, the prospects for the information and communication technology sector, as well as further exchange rate movements are key factors in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">In the current climate of uncertainty, careful management of the public finances is particularly important. We are facing the prospect of having to borrow more than €3 billion in both 2004 and 2005, in addition to the €1.9 billion budgeted for this year. This reality heightens further the need to adopt a strict approach to the management and control of public spending in 2003 and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">In the new and foreseeable economic environment, it is vital that priorities are established in relation to future resource allocation. Investment in education, health, infrastructure and protecting those on lower incomes will continue to command priority. Even within these areas, however, ambition will have to be tempered by the reality of available resources. Proposals which fail the Exchequer affordability test or would otherwise lead us to breach our stability and growth pact obligations do not assist the adoption of a prioritised framework for public expenditure policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">A range of expenditure management reforms are mentioned in the motion. The improvements in management systems in those specific areas, which have been introduced since the beginning of this year, are as follows: the 2003 spending profiles for each ministerial Vote group area were published at the end of January, this is a new initiative and it will facilitate an informed and transparent assessment of emerging spending trends for the year as a whole; the Department of Finance is also publishing, for the first time, a breakdown by ministerial Vote group of the issues or spending figures which underlie each monthly Exchequer statement; and the Minister for Finance will continue to submit monthly expenditure management reports to the Government on overall spending and revenue trends, which will enable any emerging problems to be identified early at Government level and remedial action, as deemed appropriate, to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">A number of measures have been introduced to facilitate expenditure control with Departments. These are: improvements in risk assessment measures and the introduction of contingency planning to cater for unforeseen pressures which may emerge as the year progresses; a requirement for spending on demand-led schemes to be managed effectively as with other spending programmes; and incentives for Departments to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. For example, where Departments secure savings as a result of efficiency measures or steps they have taken to curtail a programme, these should, as a general rule, be available for other high priority programmes within the same Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">In this context, I am heartened by the responsible approach adopted by Ministers and their respective Departments to the overall management of public spending last year. When faced with a significant number of pressures across Votes, Ministers and their Departments contributed, in a positive and constructive way, to assisting the Government in establishing priorities and ensuring that spending at end December 2002 was slightly below the planned level for Government Departments and offices as a whole. This contributed to the surplus of €95 million achieved in 2002 and also underlined the ability of the Government to adhere to its expenditure targets. Similar resolve will be necessary this year to adhere to the overall post-budget level of expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">While these control measures are important in their own right, they are also designed to encourage public service managers to seek out and exploit greater efficiencies. A number of initiatives are already in place which will help put the spotlight on value for money issues, including the management information framework, the expenditure review process and the forthcoming mid-term evaluation of the national development plan. I am aware, however, that more needs to be done. Greater delegation must be coupled with greater accountability. The public has a right to see whether it is getting value for money. I want to see a greater focus on results and outputs achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Value for money and output commensurate with the level of investment is particularly important in relation to capital expenditure. As part of the new expenditure management initiatives, the Minister for Finance intends to agree a five year capital expenditure envelope with each of his colleagues. This will provide relative certainty to Departments in planning their capital programmes going forward. In return, Departments will be expected to identify the project and programme outputs they will achieve for the envelopes provided and to deliver this output as far as possible within both budget and projected timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Our economy is in good shape and in a good position to deal with the current slowdown. We want to continue to foster the economic conditions to create wealth and jobs in this country and we cannot do so through high taxation or high borrowing. The Government did not take decisions on the 2003 Estimates lightly and did not engage in some form of technical accounting exercise to balance the books. Necessary steps were taken to ensure our continued prosperity. The only way forward is to have an ongoing sustainable match between our revenue and expenditure and the 2003 Estimates will set us on that path. A key element of management is that Government will receive timely information which ensures that any emerging problems are identified early and remedial action is taken. The expenditure reforms recently agreed by Government, and set out earlier, will contribute to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I, therefore, commend the motion before the House and commit the Government to a resolute control of public expenditure in 2003 and beyond, while ensuring resources are allocated to priority areas.</p>

          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_337">This self-congratulatory motion lauding the Government's management of the public finances is typical of the mechanical phraseology one would expect from the technocrats in the Department of Finance and not from someone with political know-how and experience or with a sense of everyday reality. It refers to the Government's determination and its commitment to keep a tight rein and keen eye on public spending and the public finances. This was reiterated by the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. He spoke of a series of mechanisms to monitor and assess the situation and early warning and red alert systems to ensure that what happened in the past would never happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Some congratulate the Minister for Finance for confounding the prophets of doom and the nay-sayers by bringing in an Exchequer surplus of €95 million. As has been said so often, not by Opposition politicians alone but by a cohort of independent economic analysts, while some of our current economic difficulties are the result of difficult international and external pressures beyond our control, the bulk of our current economic difficulties are self-inflicted. They were caused by the profligacy of both Government parties which in the 12 month period preceding the general election decided they would go for broke. In essence, the national interest was mortgaged once again in a reckless grab for power. We are now paying the price for the profligacy right across the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I listened to the Minister of State list a whole series of realities. I shall point to some realities that he might usefully confront in his summary. An Exchequer surplus of €95 million is of little comfort to the 300 workers who will shortly walk out the gates of the Square D plant, Ballinasloe, County Galway, with their dole and redundancy money in their hands and no replacement industry and no prospect of compensatory jobs in sight; of little benefit to the 137 workers about to lose their jobs at the Terex CPV plant, Clones, County Monaghan; of little consolation to the 310 highly skilled workers about to lose their jobs at the recently merged Logica and C &amp; G Company plants in Dublin and Cork, and of little comfort to the Dublin based technology firm, Marakesh, which three weeks ago announced it was to shed one third of its staff in an attempt to cut costs and keep the enterprise afloat. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy's Houdini-like Exchequer surplus trick is cold comfort to the distraught 250 workers at the Technicolour Company, Youghal, County Cork, who have been told their jobs will be phased out completely as and from next month, bringing to 5,000 the number of jobs lost in the east Cork region in the past five years. What a frightening figure and a frightening indictment. The reality is that jobs and enterprises are falling like ninepins.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">I distinctly remember being in Cabinet as Government Chief Whip for two and a half years. At every single Cabinet meeting there was a presentation by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of four to five files sanctioning and announcing new enterprises all over the place. Now we have a jobs closure every second day. All one has to do is look at the Forfás annual review and report for last year. The annual review revealed that almost 32,000 jobs were lost in companies supported by the IDA or Enterprise Ireland last year. In the past two years the number of jobs lost was 61,000. These job losses are mainly down to the Government's policy of hiking up charges, imposing stealth taxes and allowing inflation and costs to spiral out of control. Some 90% of the net jobs lost were in foreign owned companies which are more sensitive to cost pressures. The Government seems to have forgotten a fundamental lesson that in a small open economy like Ireland one cannot plough one's own furrow on tax and spend policies and not expect it to impact on the enterprise sector. The Government may have fooled the electorate but it cannot sidestep the hard realities of a competitive global economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The Forfás report only thinly veiled its criticism of the Government's failure to target, for example, the key needs of the economy, physical infrastructure, competitive energy supplies, the wide availability of broadband communications and an effective waste management policy. These fundamental requirements, some of the nuts and bolts, of a successful economy have not only not been met but also failed abysmally.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">We have an appalling public transport system, heavily congested roads and a major lack of affordable housing. Last week the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, acknowledged that the national roads building programme, targeted for completion in 2006, would at the earliest be met in 2007 – three years after schedule – with enormous additional costs in terms of additional expenditure and costs in terms of the logjam and strangulation that will occur in the main arteries of cities and towns. There are soaring costs, delays and non-delivery. The cumulative result of this incompetence and mismanagement is that more jobs will be lost and unemployment, which plagued us for so long and which we all thought and prayed was a thing of the past, will continue to grow monthly.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The reality is the economic miracle is well and truly over. Everywhere one looks prices and taxes are increasing. They are feeding off each other and pushing inflation in the direction of 6%. Any downward figure this month is only a slight and inconsistent aberration. The tax increases are so blatant that to describe them as stealth taxes any more is inaccurate and redundant. Motor tax is up 12%, hospital charges are up 26%, the drugs refund scheme threshold is up 31%, VHI premiums are up 18%, the cost of cigarettes and alcohol is up 15%, banking card charges are up 29%, ESB charges are up 13%, college fees are up 9%, parking fees are up 26%, bus fares are up 9%, and the television licence fee is up 40%. What an indictment of a Government which inherited an economy in the full flush of economic success and which has been left in such a decrepit condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">One of the core areas where the Government lauds itself is income tax. Its target was that in a short period only one in every five income tax payers would be paying tax at the 42% high threshold rate. Recent figures show that one third of income tax payers will be paying at the rate of 42% massively above the Government's target – another target well and truly blown off course. In the education area, 500 Dickensian schools are not fit for the Third World while hospital waiting lists are getting longer as I witnessed in Galway Regional Hospital this week. Many of our key services are on the brink of collapse. That a Government should come before the House and phrase a motion in such crisp and arrogant terms is the height of arrogance and an affront to the intelligence of the people who are watching, waiting and wondering. Their day will come.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">The immediate trigger for this debate was the concern about the Exchequer returns for January and, in particular, some alarmist comments made by commentators on RTE and the fact that income tax receipts had appeared to be down. If one studies the Exchequer returns, given the circumstances and conditions, they are extraordinarily good. Very often – even in good times – the January returns look distinctly flat and disappointing but this year total returns, taking all tax revenue into account, are up 10%. While I accept one cannot extrapolate too much from this, nonetheless it is comfortably above the target but if one does, there is a crude rule of thumb because tax receipts come in in different segments at different times of the year. If one divides the total by 12, it is 8.33% of revenue. In fact, 8.8% of the target of revenue was collected so the opening month is reasonably encouraging from the point of view of there not being a shortfall. I accept that one cannot extrapolate from one month, whether good or bad, but I do not think there was cause for alarm or for the sort of suggestion that the public finances were already off the rails in the first month of the year. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">On the other hand, we have the new Labour Party line which is that there is a €5.2 billion surplus. My old friend and colleague, Fergus Finlay, laid out the argument in full and I have noticed many Labour Party spokespersons repeat this line. The clear implication is that there is a lot of money in the Exchequer, so why is the Government not spending more of it? If capital spending is €3.75 billion, according to the implicit argument there is at least another €1.5 billion or so which should be spent. With terms such as "broke", "profligacy" and "the Government is not spending nearly enough" being used, it will be interesting to see how a coherent alternative will be arrived at.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I recall when Governments struggled through the first six or seven years of the 1980s with Exchequer borrowing requirements at 12% to 16% of GNP. Some of that borrowing was necessary, but there was little benefit from that sort of policy. There is a lingering belief – and not only among the current leadership of the Labour Party – that there is a great deal of virtue in the economic policies of the 1970s, in borrowing deficits and so on. I am not convinced of this, although I accept the argument that between the 1920s and 1950s we were too conservative and we should have borrowed for capital purposes. However, we went off the rails under the national coalition and under Fianna Fáil. For ten years after EU membership, we thought all our problems had been solved.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Another small country like ours which has by far the highest standard of living in the European Union is Luxembourg. It is no accident that it has the lowest borrowing level.</p>

          <p eId="para_355">We must try to do the difficult thing. I accept the argument that, in many respects, our services are deficient. Infrastructural investment is well under way. I do not accept Senator Higgins's assertion that we have an appalling public transport system. I am grateful for the public transport system, which I use on a regular basis. I accept that it requires further improvement, but to use the word "appalling" is far too dismissive of the people who provide the service, which, in many respects, is quite good.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The objective must be to maximise revenue. We discussed the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Bill earlier. This is a primary test of the argument of what is the right economic approach. I do not know how many speeches I heard in the 1980s – these came not only from parties of the left but also from Fine Gael, which, in certain respects, was in a fairly social democratic mood at that time and I believe some of its members, though not Deputy Mitchell, refer to it as "social democratic"—</p>

          <p eId="para_358">—which stated that one had to increase the money raised from banks, corporations and wealthy individuals. I still know the figures because I recall researching them.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">In 1986 we raised approximately £34 million from capital taxes and £247 million from corporation tax. That has been magnified. Corporation tax has increased by well over 1,000%. This was not done by raising the tax level and by making it more punitive. In many instances, it was done by easing the tax. The Labour Party bitterly condemned the reduction of capital gains tax from 40% to 20%. It thought this was wrong – socially, morally and so on – but the yield doubled. The Labour Party could not believe what happened because it was counter-instinctive. The problem is that many of the arguments about economics and social justice are counter-instinctive. In theory, there is a lot to be said for socialism but the trouble is that, in practice, it often does not work and is counterproductive. I do not want to be too critical because liberal capitalism and socialism have flown together to produce the type of mixed economic system we have today.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The Minister referred to value for money, a point I raised last week. I am deeply concerned about value for money and I wish there was more public discussion about it. I refer to the statement by the chairman of CIE that over half the cost of the transport investments which Dublin needs will go on property compensation. Is that what the national development plan is about? Despite what Senator McDowell tried to state, it is not primarily farmers. Large sums of money are being spent in the cities and, in particular, in Dublin where the overwhelming proportion of investment in public transport will take place. The Government needs to give serious consideration to that issue and I believe the Taoiseach has already made some noises on the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Reference was made to the loss of industry and jobs. It is always traumatic for people when that happens. However, we have got better in recent years, partly because of the confidence we have managed to create, in finding replacement industries. Only yesterday a replacement industry was announced for Roscrea, which is good news. There were big job losses in Clonmel three or four years ago, but we managed to obtain replacement industries. I hope the industrial agencies will be able to attract replacement jobs in most cases. People referred to there being job losses every day. I accept that there have been job losses, but the figure is not remotely like that in the period 1983 to 1984 when major industries such as Dunlop, Ford and Verolme closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">A point which is not always appreciated or accepted in debate is that the Government was elected not because it promised endless rosy times for the future, but because people recognised that there were more difficult times ahead. The question posed was which would be the best Government, or combination of parties, to take us through that period? It is always dangerous to extrapolate from the present to the future, particularly since we tend to lag a bit. In other words, bad flows internationally affect us with a time lag as, very often, does upward movement. We are not usually ahead in the case of upward or downward movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">There is currently an unemployment rate of under 5%. This is very different from countries such as Germany and France. It is the best in our history, and so far it is stable. While I know it is an imperfect measure, the live register has not risen very much from one year to the next and long may that continue. I hope we will get through the current difficulties without unemployment going much over 5%. Historically, all of this is unimaginable.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I am pleased that inflation appears to be coming down. A certain commentator, who listened to a Fine Gael spokesman list the various charges and price rises that have taken place – most of them under some Government agency – said the social partners should see if they are getting a decent deal. Another commentator said that as inflation is predicted to come down, they may be getting a better deal than they thought when they negotiated the deal. I believe inflation will come down. Compared to previous economic crises, depressions and recessions, we are starting off in an unprecedentedly strong position, which will be strengthened further if, as I expect, social partnership is concluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">While social partnership is not the only vital ingredient, it is a vital ingredient which has enabled us to be much more successful in the past 15 years than previously. I would counsel groups who are either not taking part, or are hesitating to take part, that my observation of social partnership is that it is not only about commitments and specifics – sometimes it is not always possible to be very specific – but as problems arise, they have mechanisms to discuss them with Government and to seek solutions with Government. It is an ongoing negotiating process over three years. I cannot imagine why any group should think it is in their interest or that they would make more point by boycotting the process. I hope as many groups as possible, including the community and voluntary sector and farm organisations, will reflect on this. While the farmers split in 1987 on whether they should or should not be partners, it has worked out very well for them over the past 15 years.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_366">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I was one of the people who asked for this debate and I believe it is important that people give of their own experiences in the discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">One of the problems in recent times is that commentators have been almost universally wrong. We should not listen to economists. Every economist who speaks should be literally gagged. Most of the main names are, in fact, third level teachers. The others work for financial institutions who require them to present an image which makes it easier to sell their product. These things should be said. We hear very little in the media from a small number of independent economists, because they are not the ones who are colourful. The colourful ones, who work in third level institutions, are the ones we hear regularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">A classic example of this in the past three or four months is that these people were completely and utterly incorrect in their assessment of how the books would stand at the end of this year. The loudest of them, not a university teacher, was just €1 billion out. How can these people be €1 billion wrong and then have the brass neck to come on radio and television with no sense of what they said last month? In regard to January and February of this year, their prognosis on inflation has been almost universally wrong, with the exception of Robbie Kelleher who was quoted as taking an opposite view. All the others mentioned high inflation for these two months. They predicted it would be approximately 6%, even though we have seen it decrease from 5.1% to 4.8%. I do not know who is right or wrong in all of this. I suspect it is a bit like the recent debate with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, because people do their best in one way or another.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">I want to point out some issues of Government policy with which I fundamentally disagree, but I also think that speakers should talk about their own experiences. I would like to hear my colleague, Senator Quinn, who takes a snapshot every day of what consumers are doing with their money. He could give a much cleaner interpretation of the way the economy is going than many people who are looking into books and ledgers. It is people on the ground who can give that viewpoint.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I do not know where growth is going and neither does anyone else. Certainly it is dropping, but I do not know how low it will go. However, I want to say one thing about inflation levels. Ireland is still developing and growing and it is the case in any economic model that as long as our growth is faster than the growth in the other member states of the European Union, so also will be the inflation rate because these patterns are always cyclical. As growth decreases this year to 0.5%, 1% or 2%, it will interesting to see if the inflation rate decreases also. The indications are that it will.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The Government should be more worried about stagflation than inflation, because the economic cycle is moving in such a way that we will be able to pull back inflation. If we come back to this debate at the end of this calendar year, we will be talking about the need to put some heat and growth into the economy, which is what I am more worried about. If we stop, it will be very difficult to get going again.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">In terms of where we are nationally, it is incomprehensible to me that the normal approaches to good housekeeping, which are thrust upon all people in all places, are not adopted by Government. Over the years, I have heard Minister after Minister talking about the importance of multiannual budgeting and a multiannual approach. Multiannual accounting must go along with that, which may sometimes require borrowing. There is no substantial credible case against borrowing at this time, when we all agree that infrastructural investment has two key aspects at a time of depression. First, it is a good injection into the economy but, more importantly, it provides the net to get out of a depression. We need an infrastructure to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">It makes no sense to try to balance the books on an annual basis. We must live within our means, however, but it is like someone buying a house. If one had to wait to get the money, one would never buy a house. If something is a good investment, we must borrow in a way which is economic, makes financial sense and is cost-effective. This is what everyone does and the State should also do it. It is wrong that we are not doing it at this stage. I am not saying we should over-borrow but I am saying it is wrong to introduce the question of the 1970s and 1980s to this debate unless we are talking about a form of profligacy to which nobody is committed. One cannot pay for the infrastructural investment I have mentioned without borrowing, although we need to be sure that we will work our way out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I wish to discuss one other aspect of Government policy in relation to the approach I have been advocating. I have decided to choose two issues which I do not accept on a macro level. I do not agree with the Government's determination to reduce corporation tax this year. It is unforgivable when one considers that the State cannot afford to pay for BreastCheck facilities in County Mayo. The tax breaks being provided by the Government are not necessary. Although I am fundamentally opposed to reducing corporation tax to 12.5%, I wonder why, if it had to be reduced, it could not have been delayed for a couple of years during which the extra funds could have been used in a positive way. Fair-minded people will accept that the decision was wrong and did not represent the desired approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The issues are the same for all sides of the political spectrum, regardless of one's perspective. It is important that we recognise that the first issue has to be the creation of wealth. Those of us who represent various interests should ensure this matter is on the agenda. Everybody understands that we need to be competitive and productive if we are to create wealth. One of the great things about national agreements, the importance of which was mentioned by Senator Mansergh, is that people on all sides have had to listen to each other's viewpoints, regardless of whether they agree or disagree with them. There is a commitment among the social partners to having a competitive and productive economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">It is worth pointing out something to which reference is not normally made. My economist friends, whom I mentioned, rarely mention the fact that Irish workers have the best productivity record in Europe over the last ten years. That simple statement does not even begin to describe their achievements. Statistics from the CSO and the European Union show that they have exponentially increased their productivity over the last ten years. It is worth recognising the huge commitment of Irish workers, an aspect of social partnership often ignored. Similarly, the number of days lost through industrial disputes has decreased in the last ten years, despite media reports to the opposite effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Workers expect a fair share of the dividends of their efforts and want to be able to look to the future. An extraordinary error was made in UK legislation in the last two years and I understand it has ramifications for people in this country. The UK Act requires that pensions balance themselves on an annual basis, which is impossible to achieve as it goes against the philosophy and theory of pension planning. It seems that some companies may not be able to meet their long-term pension liabilities. Workers need to be protected in such circumstances. It has been suggested in recent times that we should tighten our pensions legislation to ensure pension funds are not based on the company for which the pension holder works. I recently discovered that the pension fund of a major store, involved in a possible takeover, holds 12% or 13% of the company's equity. It seems like a huge investment. A great deal of negativity has been associated with the collapse of Enron but we should not forget that the company's pensioners had hugely invested in Enron equities. They lost out in two ways as a result. I ask the Minister of State to bring this matter to his Department for consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">One of the things we look for in the model of the economy is the creation of wealth, which requires us to be productive and competitive. The creation of wealth can be conducted in a fair way. The Government's most significant step forward in recent times was when the Taoiseach gave a commitment to the social partners in the last ten days. He said the Government would support the inclusion of the European Union charter of fundamental rights in the next EU treaty. This statement represents a significant move in terms of the protection people will receive. There can be no partnership without a recognition that the rights of workers and their families need to be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I suspect that the distribution of wealth, which follows the creation of wealth, is the source of the majority of arguments in relation to economic affairs. Wealth is redistributed through reinvestment, profit and taxation. I would like to hear more about this issue from the Minister of State's party, the Progressive Democrats. While I have heard its representatives discuss the issues, I would like to know the economic principle that governs it. How much of every 100 units of profit made by a company should be distributed into social services, health and education? How much should be pure profit and how much should be taken in the form of taxation? How should it be distributed? We would understand more about the party's philosophy if such figures were made available. Many of the labels used such as capitalism, socialism and communism involve people pushing their views on others but I prefer to hear people say what they feel should be done. When one's philosophy has been made clear, one can work out where it fits into our terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">While I know it is a minority view, I believe income tax is too low. The problems we are having in some service areas result from a lack of revenue. I certainly do not believe we can afford to further reduce income tax. It is not a very popular viewpoint, not least among those whom I represent in various places, but I firmly and honestly believe it.</p>

This is as true in relation to fiscal, financial and economic policies as it is in relation to any other form of human endeavour. There is no doubt that Ireland's growth has slowed in recent times and that the public finances have become tighter. A number of companies have closed and many workers have been laid off. We have realised that we will be unable to do the things we intend to do as quickly as we would have liked. I do not think anybody in either of the Government parties would have any difficulty in recognising this reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">One would think, if one was to believe certain commentators, that the country was in dire straits, that confidence had collapsed, that unemployment levels were soaring and that the economy was sinking but nothing could be further from the truth. It is worth stating some of the facts. The economy is continuing to grow, albeit at a more modest pace than in recent years. Our economic performance is, in fact, among the best in the developed world. Despite recent job losses, our rate of unemployment is still at 4.5%, effectively equivalent to full employment. Our rate of unemployment is one of the lowest in Europe and about half the EU average.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">It is understandable but sad that Opposition spokesmen would seek to make cheap political capital out of job losses in the private sector. I accept there have been job losses, but due to international factors there is very little any Government or company can do about that. We live in a dynamic economy, not the dead economy created by Fine Gael in the 1980s. Just months ago, the people of Roscrea were devastated by the closure of a local pharmaceutical plant. Today, they are celebrating the re-opening of that plant under new ownership. Opposition politicians might preach gloom and doom, but ordinary people get on with their business and avail of the opportunities on offer in a dynamic and fast-moving economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">People point to the deterioration in the public finances as if they were in danger of drifting back into the dire straits experienced in the 1980s. This is not the case. We are still running strong surpluses in our current accounts and spending on day-to-day activities is more than covered by tax revenues. Our overall debt levels are the second lowest in the EU, after debt-free Luxembourg, and we are well within borrowing limits set down in the EU stability and growth pact. This is no mean feat at a time when as many as four member states are set to breach the key 3% GDP ceiling on government borrowing in a particular year.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">That is not to say everything in the garden is rosy because it is not. We must recognise the difficult international environment in which we operate. There is great tension in the Middle East and the wider world because of the Iraq crisis. The American economy has slowed after a period of very impressive growth, the Japanese economy remains stagnant and growth levels in the EU's largest economy, Germany, have dropped to near zero. This is a challenging international environment. It is particularly challenging for Ireland, one of the most open economies in the world and where hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on our ability to export and to hold onto our global marketplace. I am confident that we will be able to meet the challenges of the international environment, that we will keep the competitive edge essential for success in the international marketplace and that we will maintain the stability in our public finances which is the vital foundation on which a competitive economy is built.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">This Government made huge strides in reforming the taxation system during its first five year term in office. Taxes were cut on enterprise, investment and employment and the economic results are there for all to see. In five years, the lifetime of a single Government, the country moved from mass unemployment to full employment. The number of people at work shot up by almost 400,000 and the number caught in long-term unemployment – the worst of all poverty traps – fell from 90,000 to just 20,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The scope for tax cuts and tax reform over the next five years will be limited and the two Government parties recognised that in the manifestos they put before the people last summer and in the joint programme for Government, published in June. The Government did not make reckless promises, did not offer compensation to every group in the country and was in no way reckless with its fiscal policies when it went before the people. It is vital, however, that we preserve the progress that has been made, that we maintain low levels of taxation on enterprise, investment and employment and that we keep the public finances under firm control. Provided we do so, we will consolidate the gains made in recent years and will put the country on a sound footing for future growth.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_141">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_395">Senator O'Toole sought this debate because he questioned the independence of some of the economists and other authorities who regularly lecture us with regard to the economy. I could not agree more and I am not taking a cheap shot as this is an important point. Much of our discussion on these issues is informed by people who should carry a bias warning. The majority of them are academics or are those we hear most often on radio and television, those working for financial institutions with an interest in a particular analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The best example of this is the way that the SSIAs were approached by those commentators heard on radio at 7.55 a.m. These people would have real difficulty with the Government spending €20 million more on BreastCheck to make it a nationwide service and would happily condemn any increase in public expenditure to improve public services. However, none of them has any difficulty with the SSIA scheme which will take €500 million per year for the next five years out of the country's tax base. Members can only imagine what could have been done with that money had we not taken that course, or what we could do if we were to try to recover some of it. Not one of these commentators – I challenge anyone to tell me otherwise – has ever said anything remotely critical about the scheme for the simple reason that the institutions and organisations for which they work are busily involved in selling products that depend on the scheme for money and profits. It is important that we realise, when they talk to Ms Geraldine Harney on the radio at 7.55 a.m., from where these people are coming, at least regarding public expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The Minister's speech was quite interesting because, although it is generally upbeat, it includes a few very downbeat figures, which are clearly intended to signal that we should lower expectations regarding economic growth this year. The Minister of State gave a figure of just 1.4% growth for the first three quarters of last year and, if the trend continues, that will come down even further in the context of the full 12 month figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">That is a low level of growth. Some years ago, optimistically looking to the future, people thought that 5% was a sustainable level of growth and, to be fair, most parties going into the general election posited their fiscal intentions for the next five years on the basis of 5% growth. To talk of 1.4% or perhaps less for last year is a long way short of that and those figures are genuinely alarming. When Senators on the Government side say that we have nothing to worry about, I suggest that the evidence that we have something to worry about is not just in regard to the job losses to which Senator Higgins referred but also in regard to the figures outlined by the Minister of State. This is a matter of serious concern and, if growth continues at that level, we will be in real trouble from a fiscal point of view and otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The greatest risk at present is in regard to competitiveness. The appreciation of the euro in recent weeks will cause difficulties. We are still at a level which is, broadly speaking, lower than when the euro was introduced three years ago, but it is definitely causing difficulties. Ireland, in monetary terms, has appreciated by about 9% against its main trading partners and by more than that against sterling. As Senator Higgins pointed out, it is indigenous industry which is most susceptible to this kind of competitive pressure and that will start making itself felt if the euro continues to appreciate in the next few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">There is only a limited amount we can do about that in terms of monetary policy, but there are things we can do about it in terms of other competitive pressures. There is a need to improve the infrastructure and reduce transport costs for industry. That falls within the remit of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Senator Mansergh referred to the differences between Fine Gael and Labour in their approach to fiscal policy. Given that they are different political parties, it would be surprising if there was not a difference. These differences will continue and some may be substantial. Neither party has anything to apologise for in that. I assume the Government parties would claim to hold differences. If not, perhaps members from one party should join the other, for example, the Minister for Finance might join the Progressive Democrats. Different parties manage to coalesce in Government provided they reach an agreement on which they are willing to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I believe there is scope for choice and that it should be in favour of additional expenditure. At present, the current budget surplus is €5 billion. I cannot foresee any circumstances over the foreseeable future where borrowing for current spending purposes should be countenanced. That should be a hard rule. However, I see no reasons why there should not be borrowing for capital purposes. It should be considered on a year by year basis. The general rule must be to take a multi-annual approach, as referred to by the Minister of State. Expenditure on the roads programme is an example of where this approach might be applied. In this context, there is a need to assess the needs of the economy over the next four to five years, to decide on how much should be spent on the roads programme and to then monitor delivery. Such programmes cannot be left to the whim of the relevant Minister on a year by year basis. To do so runs the risk of failure to deliver and, more seriously, failure to secure the necessary involvement of foreign contractors etc., to ensure delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Multi-annual budgeting on capital programmes is a necessity. We have been very poor on this and there is a need to improve on our approach. A few years ago the then Government started a measure of multi-annual budgeting, but it was a disaster. It was never more than a loose guideline and was never adhered to. It did not provide a great deal more information than was previously available and it has effectively been discontinued. Perhaps the more intelligent and strategic approach is to select those programmes that clearly need multi-annual budgeting, such as capital programmes, and to proceed on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">President Prodi said recently he considered that in current economic circumstances there is room for flexibility with regard to the Stability and Growth Pact. We need flexibility in this area, if not this year then within the next two years. It is daft that we should be prevented from investing in the infrastructure of the country by virtue of the pact's 3% limit, which was designed for reasons that have nothing to do with our circumstances. We can make common cause with other countries that have low debt to GDP ratios, such as the United Kingdom, in seeking to secure flexibility for the system. It is now time to proceed on this basis. Over the next several months there will be an open door on the issue when there will be an overwhelming argument for flexibility. We should push on that door rather than repeating the nonsense that the pact is a sovereign commitment we made several years ago. It was a political agreement made for the purpose of establishing the single currency. It succeeded in that, but it is now time to press for the flexibility which countries such as Ireland need to enable them to make necessary investments, especially in the infrastructure and public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Minister of State referred to changes made in the past few months to improve the management of the public services. I accessed the Department's website to check the statement on projected current and capital expenditure by Department by month to the end of the year. I cannot understand it and it is difficult to envisage how anybody could. It is a series of two numbers per Department per month for the year. There is no explanation as to what underlies the figures, what expenditure is indicated on a monthly basis or why expenditure is heavy in one month, for example, October, while light in other months, such as during the summer. Doubtless officials in the Department know the answers to these questions, but if this information is to make sense it must be underpinned with much more information than has been made available to the public arena.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">This is only a minor reform. It creates the impression that the Minister has sanctioned it with the sole purpose of letting people know if expenditure is on target for any given month. However, we should all recognise that what is required is greater control over public expenditure and, perhaps more importantly, greater evaluation, both before and as it is spent. I have previously spoken at length on this issue. In this regard, the NESC report on managing public expenditure, published before Christmas, contains a number of fine and useful recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">In all of this the Department of Finance has the lead role and essentially has the power of veto. Given this it is perhaps not interested in establishing mechanisms that would inevitably broaden the level of accountability, remove some of its power and make it more accountable for the power it wields. However, it would be in the interests of the control of public expenditure and the management of the economy if some of the NESC report recommendations were implemented. The report points to difficulties, such as the absence of performance management and the undertaking of evaluations which are not used to inform subsequent decisions. It also points to a failure to concentrate on outputs and value for money in terms of expenditure. In terms of accountability to committees, such as those of the Oireachtas, it points to a concentration on whether money was spent correctly, regularly and in accordance with decisions that have been taken which ignore value for money implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Senator Mansergh outlined how various Governments have managed public expenditure. I do not wish to dwell on this because, inevitably, the debate tends to be sterile. My major criticisms of the management of public expenditure of the past five years is not that the Government is currently spending too much but that it has used expenditure as a tap, the flow of which has effectively been determined by the electoral cycle. The previous Government started its terms of office by spending too little and ended it by spending far too much. The result of this approach is gross inefficiency that, almost by definition, ensures value for money is not achieved. We need to stop this cycle and ensure that public expenditure is managed on a year to year basis in accordance with norms and determined outcomes to which we all have an input. All the signs indicate the Government has no intention of proceeding on this basis and that it has set on the same course it took during the last Dáil. It will begin by spending relatively little but in another two or three years, as it faces the prospect of a general election, it will spend more and money will become available for programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The economy is still in reasonably good shape, sufficiently good shape to offer us choices in terms of how we manage it. There are genuine differences between the Government and the Opposition on the way to proceed. However, even on the admission of the Government, there are serious downside risks, which are increasing. That situation will require good management by the Government and vigilance on the part of us all.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_410">Like my colleagues, I welcome the Minister of State. This is a very important opportunity for us to reflect on where we stand economically and where we are going. I applaud Senator McDowell on the prudent approach he took. One could paraphrase his closing remarks by saying the good ship Ireland is moving through rather choppy waters and will require a good captain at its helm to ensure we overcome what I hope are the short-term difficulties facing the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I could not help reflecting on the past 18 months because there have been many public discussions and political charges levelled at the Government regarding how it managed the economy in its first term of office and how it proposed to do so entering its second term. As a result of these charges and the ensuing public controversy, I thought it would be useful to examine the various positions the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, took over the past 12 or 15 months and which he continues to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">An editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 November 2001, six months before the general election, stated the Minister was using words such as “prudence” and “caution” when he launched the Government's spending programme for 2002. At the time it was becoming apparent that there was a slow-down in economic growth. Additionally, there was a real fear that the country's finances would be skewed to such an extent that the big spending Ministries, such as those pertaining to education and health, and the national development plan would be put in serious peril.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">People make economic predictions that do not always turn out to be valid. I used to think economists made the predictions because they were not accountable but I suppose journalists are put in the same category in the sense that they can also make them. On 16 November 2001 Jane Suiter and Mark Brennock, two respected journalists with <i>The Irish Times</i>, stated in an article: “For the first time since the Rainbow Coalition was in office in 1997, the Government will have little choice but to resort to borrowing as declining growth, rising unemployment and falling tax revenues take their toll on Exchequer revenue in the run-in to the general election”. Furthermore, they stated: “Mr McCreevy insisted the Government should not spend money it did not have, although he said some new spending projects would be announced in the Budget on December 5th”. However, in the same article Fine Gael is quoted as having warned the Government that it would have to borrow as much as €1 billion, the largest amount since 1987. As we all know, there was a surplus of €95 million last year. Even as far back as September, there was much speculation among economic commentators that the Government would not reach spending targets by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Another important point relates to the alleged reneging on the Government's programme and the fact that it somehow misled the electorate on the economy and hid the real figures. An article in the <i>Irish Independent </i>under the heading, McCreevy rules out pre-poll spending splurge, stated the following: “With polling day no more than four months away, Mr. McCreevy has made it clear he is going to keep a tight hold of the purse strings and will not allow spending to run out of control”. This article was written on 16 January 2002, five months before the general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The same article states that, in an unusual move, the Minister called in the Secretary General of each Department to tell them the situation and impress on them the importance of holding the line. In the same article, he is quoted as having said to the Secretaries General that the fact that there was an election in the offing did not mean that there would be extra money available to spend. These are hardly the sentiments of a spendthrift Minister for Finance who did not seem to care about the direction the economy was taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">In a Dáil debate on 20 March 2002 the Minister in his concluding remarks stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_417">I remind the House that the Government has fostered a climate in which it has been possible to deliver on our promises. In many cases, we have actually exceeded our commitments. There is no doubt we have improved the standard of living and the level of public services. We have also ensured the economy can continue to deliver good levels of growth so that we can make further progress into the future . The Government's record shows that we have policies that work now and will work for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I do not mean to give these quotes primarily to score cheap political points but it is important that the accuracy of many of the statements made by the Minister be noted when people start losing the run of themselves, which inevitably happens in political crossfire.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 4 April 2002, under the headline, Public Finances Cause Concern, stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_420">At the heart of the Government's difficulties was a fall of almost 3 per cent in tax revenues for the first three months of the year [2002]. Income tax receipts fell . against predicted growth . At the same time, current Government spending rose . It is clear from the precipitous drop in spending that projects have been put on hold across a range of Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">However the reduction referred to was much less than that which obtained in the January-February period. There was obviously a very strong, fiscally secure climate in the Department of Finance prior to the general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">My final quotation is from the economist, Brendan Walsh, who states: "Most commentators now doubt that the small projected surplus cobbled together by the Minister last December will be achieved." He is referring to December 2001 and we know that there was a surplus last year of €95 million. He also states:</p>
          <p eId="para_423">It is now likely that the overall balance will move into deficit this year after six successive surpluses from 1996 to 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">On current projections, by 2003 the deficit will have risen to the level last seen in 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">He adds that Ireland's public finances remain in good shape despite the recent deterioration. He further stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_426">To his credit Mr McCreevy has tried to resist these pressures and to link increased spending to greater efficiency. But despite his misgivings about the "tax and spend" philosophy he has not been able to avert a rise in current spending relative to GNP.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The reason it is necessary to put matters in context is the Government has attempted to exercise fiscal prudence since it became apparent towards the last quarter of 2001 that there was a definite reduction in growth and economic activity, fuelled by the tragic events of 11 September 2001. It was obvious to financial commentators prior to that that there was a slowing down of economic activity. There is no doubt that, based on the record inside and outside this House and the figures circulated by the Department of Finance before and after the general election, the Government was aware of what was happening. It was transparent and conveyed the relevant details to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">If one looks back at the euphoria of the previous five years, one will note that things were so good across a range of Departments and the amount of money at the disposal of the Government from and prior to 1997 was so great that the public was inured to the possibility that the good times could end or decline. I acknowledge the contribution the rainbow coalition made between 1994 and 1997, when figures were beginning to come on line for the first time since the foundation of the State. It is human nature that the public might make such assumptions about the economy given that the State has come a long way since 1922 and went through a period of unprecedented growth and prosperity from 1994 to this year. Such growth was never experienced in our history until 1994, not even during the British colonial period that lasted for hundreds of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I refute the recent announcement made on road spending, particularly in my part of the country, and the allegations made in the public press that the Minister for Transport had ignored the west. The record speaks for itself and I would like briefly to quote the figures. Last week Donegal received €3 million for preliminary work on the Ballyshannon-Bundoran bypass, Sligo received €11 million for archaeological and other works on the town's inner relief road, Clare received €16 million for preliminary work on the Ennis bypass and Mayo received €5 million for the Knock, Claremorris, Ballina and Bohola roads. That expenditure is welcome, though it is not enough and my colleagues and I will be pressing the Minister to ensure a greater disbursement in the next spending round. The funding is enough, however, to give lie to the myth that the west has been ignored or neglected by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I hope the Minister will be successful in the relocation of Department of Agriculture and Food staff from Sligo to my home town of Drumshanbo. The move is at a sensitive stage, but hopefully the Minister will have positive news with regard to a development which would make a tremendous contribution to the economic well being of my area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_143">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_431">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this very important debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I resent the opening paragraphs of the Minister of State's speech in which he uses the words "misinformed comment" and "oft repeated, erroneous claims". I remind the Minister and other members of Fianna Fáil, in particular Senator Mooney who seems to live in a tellytubby land of make believe, that before the general election, mothers were given a massive children's allowance pay-out and promised a huge increase after the Government took office. That increase was deferred and they were given only €10. The effect of abandoning the summer jobs scheme will be felt very soon and Senator Mooney will know many in Leitrim who will be affected. The schools building programme was the subject of promises by every potential Fianna Fáil Deputy in the run up to the election, but reality quickly dawned on the Government when it secured its win and cutbacks were made. What sort of country do we live in when the price of affordable housing in Kildare is €140,000? How can young people buy those houses?</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Part-time education centres everywhere are being threatened with closure, as are the three full-time education centres in Kildare, Kilkenny and Sligo, near Senator Mooney's base. Depreciation of farm equipment has been extended from five years to eight years, which will have a massive impact on contractors and will push up costs to farmers. I presume the former and distinguished leader of the IFA, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, was involved in negotiations with the NRA regarding compulsory purchase orders and the relevant capital gains tax changes. These will severely impact on farmers and landowners who are affected by the much-needed motorways. It is most unfair that those who are having land taken from them compulsorily are being doubly insulted by the capital gains tax changes which will cut back their options.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I resent the tendency of the Government to blame anything negative on outside forces while claiming credit for positive developments. In the USA insurance costs have not increased since 11 September 2001, which begs the question as to why they have risen so steeply in Ireland and other EU member states. The Minister should publish figures from other countries which would allow us to see what is happening and to correct any imbalance. I question the sincerity of the Tánaiste who is dancing around the issue of insurance. There is a very able Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who could tackle the legal system which is intrinsically linked to the problems in the insurance industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The central question facing us does not relate to the creation of wealth, but to its distribution. The Minister for Finance controls expenditure and when there are surpluses it proves that not enough is being spent in the public sector. We should not rule out the idea of borrowing for worthwhile projects. One has to query the mentality in the Department of Finance which plans, correctly, for the distant future with a national pension reserve fund, but allows four and five year olds to be educated in sub-standard schools. A balance must be struck between long-term goals and current realities. Politicians know about the real world. We need a pensions fund, but we also need to put some of our money into proper worthwhile capital projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The introduction of stealth taxes is illustrated clearly by the increase in motor taxation which the Minister for Finance conveniently announced the day after the budget rather than on the day itself. We were told that extra money would be put into roads, but it has not materialised and there has been very little difference in the allocations to local authorities this year compared to last year, even allowing for the motor tax increase. I challenge the Minister to publish the sums received by local authorities in motor taxation to illustrate how little difference there is in the amounts they are receiving. The tax increase is being used to make up shortfalls in other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">In the long term we need to look at a consumer confidence index. For the first time I am hearing friends under the age of 30 talking about job insecurity, something they never mentioned before. People are worried as things tighten up. I am concerned at the increases we have seen in social welfare and I wonder if we can continue to sustain them in light of changed economic conditions. It is likely that the number of social welfare recipients will increase, but it is not clear that the Government has made provision for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I worry about the SSIA scheme and while I realise that when the money is paid out in four or five years it will go into the economy, there could be a great cost to the State. Perhaps the Minister will consider at this late stage an opt-out clause for people who cannot keep up their SSIA payments. It would be a generous gesture by the Government towards those who suffer job loss or changed economic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Deputy Paul McGrath recently carried out research in the context of the row with the ASTI which the Government precipitated. Teachers were supervising for free beforehand. In County Westmeath alone, the use of external supervisors resulted in an overpayment of €500,000 which could have been saved if the teachers had been paid directly. That scenario is replicated around the country, which will help Senators to imagine the figures involved. The Government should hang its head in shame since that money could have been spent on primary and secondary school building projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I am delighted to hear from the Minister and Fianna Fáil Senators that money is plentiful. I look forward to the inception of the Barrow drainage scheme in Carlow which I have lately been told has been put on the long finger. I take it from the positive comments today that this should not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Another matter of concern is the deal hammered out between former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the religious orders. It is a pity Senator Mooney is not in the House. He attaches much importance to <i>The Irish Times</i> and would surely be concerned at the opinion poll it published lately.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">Senator O'Toole said that nobody predicted the Celtic tiger economy and that is absolutely true; not one professional economist or academic predicted its emergence. Economics is universally known as the "dismal science" and for years we listened to the predictions of doom. Despite those dark forebodings and the constant efforts of some to demean the Government's economic efforts, particularly throughout the 1980s, the economy became a universal model for small developing countries in eastern Europe and elsewhere. Corrective action is currently being taken because no country could sustain a 10% annual growth rate in the long term. Such corrective action was necessary because the expectations of young people, to whom Senator Browne referred, had become too high. They sought huge salaries and wanted to be managing directors as soon as they graduated from university.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">—yet in 80 years we have produced this model by acting together. We should keep reminding ourselves how great we are because it is a fact. Ireland is the most beautiful country in the world. On each occasion I return from abroad and the plane comes in to land, I get an overwhelming feeling of pleasure when I see the variety of colours – literally, 40 shades of green – below. It is always a pleasure to come home and see what we have made of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I listened carefully to the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and I was pleased to hear about the management of expenditure now being put in place by the Department of Finance. We will have to convey the management of these accounts to the public in a transparent manner. For example, I was frustrated and shocked by the announcement of a €95 million surplus during Christmas week, having been told up to then how bad things were. We cannot allow these matters to be handled in such a way again. On one hand, the public was being told things were bad and that we all had to tighten our belts, while, on the other, the Exchequer had an end of year surplus of €95 million. I do not know how that happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I do not usually flatter Ministers or their Departments, but in this case the Minister of State's contribution was impressive. We are facing challenges ahead because people are cynical about politicians and Governments. They are opting for independent candidates at election time, rather than for mainstream parties. We must convey to the public that the Government is practising good housekeeping. During the Government's previous period in office, we preached about good housekeeping. However, we hit a crisis over payments to haemophiliacs. We do not want anything like that to recur.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">I am here to speak my mind and tell the truth. We should practise good housekeeping at home because we are supposed to be tightening our belts. People can have a meeting over a cup of coffee instead of during lunch or dinner. I do not wish to be dour about practising probity, but in the current circumstances the Government must provide a good example. When people read about such matters in the newspapers they lose faith in the political process.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The strength of the euro <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling presents a serious challenge for indigenous companies, including my own. Most indigenous companies export to Britain, but they are losing their competitiveness due to the growing strength of the euro. If Irish companies do not keep their eye on the ball and get their act together they will not be able to compete in Britain. However, this matter is not attracting publicity in the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">While future budgets will have to be prudent, I had a difficulty with the most recent which introduced cuts in community employment schemes. This is a pet issue of mine. Such a bureaucratic decision to cut funding for areas of social deprivation was absolute madness because budgets should look after the least well off.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The Government should do something about the cost of lawyers at the tribunals because that is another thing that drives the public crazy. Why does this happen with every tribunal of inquiry that is established? Last Sunday, I read in the newspaper that these barristers will not get out of bed for less than €2,500 a day. I do not know why specific arrangements setting parameters for the level of such payments cannot be made in advance of a tribunal being established. Barristers are the richest people in the country, but the Government should set an example by not allowing a small group of people to earn €2,500 each per day for this type of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Senator O'Toole raised the PAYE issue and said our tax base is too low, but that is ridiculous. PAYE workers do not want to see their tax base being increased again. The last occasion on which this happened was a debilitating period and everyone felt miserable because their salaries were being cut and they could not spend what they earned. We do not want to return to that situation. The Government should, however, provide leadership concerning those who are earning extravagant salaries.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_157">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_465">The Minister of State's contribution was extremely interesting. Earlier, Senator O'Toole asked us to speak from personal experience and I intend to do that. I was delighted to hear so many speakers doing so today. Senator White spoke from personal experience and the knowledge gained by running her own business, about the effect on exports of our currency's strength compared to sterling. That is a reminder of the challenges facing us.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Senator White also referred to the past 80 years, but it is only in the past ten years that the economy has become successful. Somewhere in the period 1987 to 1991, we got things right. We made a lot of blunders in the previous years. I remember well in 1991 meeting two people, one from Argentina and the other from Canada. They described how in 1922 their countries were equal in population, natural resources and opportunity. By 1999, one of them – Argentina – had become a failure and was practically bankrupt. The other had become a G7 nation and was successful. If we lose the economy we have enjoyed for the past ten years, we cannot blame anyone but ourselves. As Senator White said, we are an independent nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I wish to tell the House what I hear, as Senator O'Toole says, on the shop floor. I hear concern about job security. I hear concern when people are purchasing and spending. They are worried about the future, about the overtime and bonuses they were able to earn last year. Now they know of friends and neighbours who are losing their jobs and they worry that they will be next.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I hear concerns about inflation. They are aware that it is no longer in our own hands to control the rate of inflation, which is double what it is elsewhere in Europe. I speak from a business point of view. I do not agree at all with Senator O'Toole and I agree entirely with Senator Mansergh, who talked about the reduction in the percentage tax actually increasing the take, both in capital and company tax. The assumption that one will make more money if one increases the percentage of tax or increases prices by X per cent is not correct. If a business increases its prices by X per cent it will probably lose business. An increase in tax percentage will probably result in less earnings because less tax is earned on that basis. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has the real example with the betting tax. Every time he reduced it he got more money in.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I have heard a number of Senators make the point that it is all right to borrow. I know they will say that it should only be for capital purposes and not for current expenditure, but in my business I have seen a number of companies go out of business because they borrowed for capital purposes and did not have their sums right.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I want to ensure that this little country of ours is around in ten, 20, 30 and 40 years time. We must focus on what we can do at this stage to make sure that we do not take the wrong steps. I will concentrate on two inter-linked themes, competitiveness – which was mentioned by Senator McDowell – and public spending. They both pose serious problems for us which will certainly make big trouble down the road unless we change our attitude and our behaviour now.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">For several years we have taken our eye off the competitiveness ball. As a country which depends crucially on being able to attract foreign investment, our success is directly related to our overall competitiveness. It is a mixed bag, consisting of our labour costs, taxation system, regulation regime, insurance costs, infrastructure and the quality of life that we have to offer. If we remain broadly competitive across the majority of these parameters we will continue to attract overseas investment and the companies that operate from here will be successful in their export markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Unfortunately over the past few years there has been a very steady erosion of this national competitiveness and with regard to almost all those parameters. We have already begun to lose investment as a result. We are certainly far from the heady days of the 1990s when companies were queuing up to get a foothold in Ireland at almost any price. If this trend continues we will not be far from the day when we will lose out on most investment decisions rather than winning most of them, as had been the case in the past 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">One of the most pernicious aspects of the loss of competitiveness is that it happens very unobtrusively – it creeps up on us. It is due to a multiplicity of factors and there is no single cause or moment in time when we suddenly become uncompetitive. I suggest that over the past few years we have been closing our eyes to reality and allowing it to happen. Some of the consequences have been hidden or masked and we have been slow to realise what was happening. For instance, last year the exceptional performance of the chemical sector masked quite serious and sharp falls in our overall industrial performance. Our unemployment figures have been creeping up over the same period, but not by anything like they would have done had they not been masked by the one-off and quite unsustainable increases in public sector employment in the run up to the last general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">As we know from hearing about factory closures, private sector unemployment is rising sharply. It is important not to blame this downturn entirely on external conditions and we are in danger of doing that. I heard those sentiments in the House today. The challenge of competitiveness would be there even if there was a world economic recovery. We should not console ourselves with the false idea that everything will bounce back once the world economy recovers. The world may bounce back but there is no guarantee that we will bounce back with it and certainly not to the position we enjoyed in the late 1990s.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Our failure to appreciate the importance of competitiveness goes to the heart of our attitude to inflation. For the past three years our inflation has been double that of the rest of the euro zone. By definition this has reduced our competitiveness by a corresponding amount but we have displayed the wrong reaction to this situation. Instead of trying to fix inflation and remove the threat we have simply sought to compensate each other for the price increases. In doing so we forget the obvious truth: that any attempt to deal with inflation in that manner will only make the situation worse, not better. The way to deal with inflation is to fight it, not to give in to it. Fighting means incurring a cost now but in return for long-term benefits, while giving in now means avoiding an immediate cost but at the price of a much greater cost in the future. We must fix our minds on the proper target which is how to maintain competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">It is in our own hands as to whether our political reality can cope. It is in the Government's hands and just as much in the hands of the Opposition. There is a linked problem of value for money in public expenditure. We can expect little growth in tax revenues in the foreseeable future. We may have difficulty getting the tax yield to deliver even what is expected now. That is why we must look at cost benefit analysis in everything. We must get value for money in public expenditure. For example, we have pumped money into trying to reduce the waiting lists in hospitals and as far as I can see the figures do not show that there has been any impact on the problem. We must take control of that aspect of public expenditure in order to solve the problems and create the future we deserve.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_158">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_477">Most of what I wish to say on this topic has been said already. I was particularly taken by Senator Quinn's contribution and I agree with most of his speech. The wide divergence of views expressed in this debate shows that economists have a difficult job because they must study a problem from many different perspectives before making a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Senator Quinn has touched on what is probably the main issue affecting the economy, the question of competitiveness. We are led to believe the new national social partnership deal will include a package to deal with inflation which is damaging our competitiveness and progress. In recent months we have seen how Government decisions and increases have led to an increase in inflation. I do not share Senator Mansergh's view that because inflation reduced marginally in January it will keep reducing. By all accounts January is a month when economic activity can be somewhat flat. The problems we have with inflation look set to continue over the course of the next couple of months.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">I was particularly interested in some of Senator Mansergh's comments. During the debate on the budget some weeks ago Senator White announced that she was a socialist and Senator Mansergh agreed that he was also. I did not detect much socialism in his contribution tonight. Perhaps he still regards himself as a socialist.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">Many Senators have mentioned social partnership, from which nobody can doubt that we, as a nation, have benefited tremendously since it was introduced. I was particularly taken by the contribution of Senator Minihan and that of the Minister of State, a party colleague of his. I was also interested in the comments of the Tánaiste in regard to the current social partnership agreement. The farming body finds itself in a position where it is forced to make a decision as to whether it will enter into social partnership again and the Tánaiste's best answer is they would be better in than out. As far as I can ascertain, there is nothing on the table for the agricultural community in the current negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I salute the stance taken by the social partners on the agricultural side in standing up to the Government for its lack of activity and promotion of the sector and its lack of a general policy for the area of agriculture in recent years. I know it is a particularly awkward position for the Minister of State as a former leader of a farming organisation. I urge him, as someone who has sat on both sides of the table in the partnership negotiations, to bring fruition and finality to the partnership with the involvement of farmers who must be given a realistic package. They will accept it if it is realistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I was taken by the historical nature of Senator Minihan's contribution. He went back to the 1980s which I only just remember. In this debate we must look towards the future and set clear policies and objectives. I regret that the Senator chose to enter into a party political broadcast on behalf of the Progressive Democrats and revise Irish history of the 1980s in the manner in which he did. We are looking for solutions to the present problem. The projected economic growth level for the next year is 1.4%, a startling figure and an indictment of the Government's, and its predecessor's, actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">It was easy to be in government or Minister for Finance in the 1997 to 2002 period when the economy was booming. Taxes could be cut and spending increased without regard to future implications. Now that decisions have to be made by the Minister for Finance we will see what he is made of. I hope he has the courage of his convictions and will make the hard decisions needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Senator White touched on one cutback which I find objectionable in the announcements of cutbacks both before and after the budget – the cutback in the area of underprivilege. We have seen the abandonment of the student summer employment schemes. That is a retrograde step. Numerous voluntary bodies benefited from having students available to carry out essential work. The same bodies affected by the cutback are also affected by the cutback in community employment schemes. These cutbacks will have untold repercussions, particularly for sports organisations which often have their facilities looked after by people employed under the community employment scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">In a letter Deputy Noonan wrote to the Taoiseach before the general election he requested a response from the Taoiseach on the matter of the economy. The Taoiseach replied, "I can confirm that there are no significant overruns projected and no cutbacks whatsoever are being planned, secretly or otherwise." That statement has shown to be an untruth. I regret that has come about. The promises and commitments given before the general election now ring hollow.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Another promise was made in a Fianna Fáil manifesto in 1997. It promised "to increase the first-time buyer's grant to £6,350 for couples". That was some commitment in the light of the abandonment of the first-time buyer's grant. Now we are faced with its abolition and an increase in VAT which sees first-time-buyers with higher bills to pay. We are all familiar with the Bacon reports which were produced by the last Government and aimed at solving the crisis in house prices. We also know how useless those proposals turned out to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I am disappointed by the self-congratulatory tone of the debate. The problem of the man on the street is the cost of living. Owing to unfortunate circumstances I had the privilege of spending January in Australia where the cost of products in shops and pubs is reasonable in comparison with what we pay here. I remember when the cost of products was reasonable here. It is not that long ago as I am only 24 years of age. Our lack of competitiveness is where we lose ground. The cost of ordinary goods on the shelves is what concerns the man on the street. If the Government is serious about supporting the underprivileged and those on the margins of society, it must do something concrete about inflation in the economy. It is time for it to take action.</p>

          <p eId="para_494">Senator Higgins painted a grim picture in regard to job losses and it is true that we have some difficulties in this regard. He mentioned the issue of competitiveness, which came up throughout the debate. This appears to be a problem particularly in regard to our traditional manufacturing industries. The point was made that the bulk of these industries were owned by multinational companies that chose to relocate elsewhere due to our high cost base.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Thankfully, as other Senators stated, it is not all bad news. Today there was an announcement in regard to my home town. It is where I was born and went to school but, unfortunately, I do not get any votes from the area. It is not in my constituency, although it is situated within five miles from where I live. The IDA has attracted a substantial US company to replace the loss of Antigen, now called Miza. The indications are that the plant will re-open and the workforce will be taken back in what appears to be a strong investment in research and development. The Tánaiste also recently announced new jobs in Roscommon and I look forward to further such announcements. While there is not much we can do about our lack of competitiveness in traditional industries, we can build on our strengths, namely, an educated workforce with new skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Senator O'Toole raised the issues of the slowing growth rate and rising inflation. Our situation is not so bad when we compare it to Germany, which has zero growth and zero inflation. However, there are also 4.2 million people unemployed in that country. There appears to be a close link between growth and inflation. The figures for January are promising even though, as Senator Mansergh suggested, it might be difficult to extrapolate this from them. The ESRI indicated that we are at the top of the peak and the outlook is quite positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Senator McDowell raised a number of issues, including that of a lack of competitiveness and the inherent risks this presents. He acknowledged the steps taken to deal with this issue in the recent budget. He also referred to the stability and growth pact and the need for flexibility in regard to it. The Minister has reinforced his commitment to adhering to the pact. Other countries in the EU may need more flexibility on this issue than we do at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Senator Browne expressed resentment at some of the language used on this side of the House. I hope it does not affect him personally. He raised the issue of the extension of capital allowance in the budget in regard to the deal for the acquisition of lands for road building and the extension of roll-over relief. I was involved in securing the deal in regard to land with the previous Administration and believe it to be a fair one. People in my constituency who sold their land to the NRA for the Monasterevin bypass that is due to begin shortly are satisfied with it. While I am not going to quote figures, it is important that people realise how fair is the deal. Tax is unfortunately a reality we all have to face up to and the 20% capital gains tax is the cheapest rate people will ever have an opportunity to pay. I believe this point will be accepted when the new road networks are in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Senator Browne also made a point on behalf of those aged under 30. I appreciate that Senator John Phelan, who is now in the House, is 24. There is a good young front row on the Fine Gael front bench, with the exception of Deputy Higgins.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">The Senator certainly looks very fresh. The fact that such people are concerned about job security is an indication of the changed times. I have been through phases in my life where job security was a major issue, as is the case with many of the Senators here. The Government is concerned about job security and the need to be competitive and has attempted to tackle these matters in the budget. As I said earlier, some of the tough decisions taken in regard to the budget were not to do with balancing the books, rather they were designed to allow us to create jobs and wealth in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I am glad Senator White enjoyed my opening contribution. I am aware that she has given other speakers a hard time in this House and I was in a state of trepidation when she stood up to speak.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">She made a valid point about the issue of competitiveness and about the euro versus the dollar. The uncertain global political situation is a major issue for us going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Senator Quinn raised the issues of job security, inflation and borrowing. He strongly supported the decisions taken in the budget. Neither high taxation nor high borrowing is the answer to anybody's problems. We have learned from those mistakes in the past and remained steadfast in the budget in this regard. The ability to attract overseas investment will be vital for us in the future. Senator Quinn said that the pharmaceutical sector is the most exceptionally performing part of our industry. We have the expertise and by being competitive we will be able to maintain jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">We need to secure value for money in what we spend. Better management on the part of the Government is a positive step. Senator McDowell made a reference to the printout he received, but that is just a summary upon which we can improve. It is intended that every Department will in future issue figures on a monthly basis. The spotlight will be on Departments in regard to value for money and there is no Department, including my own and, in particular, the part of it – the Office of Public Works – for which I am responsible, that cannot deliver better in this regard. The more stringent the controls and scrutiny imposed by the Department of Finance on each Department and by the Members of the Oireachtas, the better focus people will have as we move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Senator John Phelan referred to the social partnership and, in particular, to some letters. I did not have the opportunity to go to my office, but I could find there a pre-election letter that indicated much confusion in the Senator's household with regard to the direction some people were taking. However, I will not deal with that matter at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">We ended up with a situation where the Estimates showed a surplus. In fairness, the Minister for Finance insisted that this would be the case in spite of all the accusations that were made against him throughout the year. While the sum of €85 million or €95 million might not be much it was a surplus and it exonerates his strategy, which is at the core of this matter. The decisions taken in the budget were not taken lightly, they were not in any way a technical exercise. They were necessary steps which had to be taken to ensure our continued prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The only way forward is a sustainable economy in which we match revenue and expenditure. The 2003 Estimates are taking us in that direction. A key element in managing such economic development will be ensuring any emerging problems are identified early and remedial action is taken. The budget provided the framework for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The Government is committed to resolute control of public expenditure in 2003 and beyond. The areas of health, education and social welfare will be key priorities for the Government.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Scrapie Genotyping Project.</heading>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_515">It was the sad death, at such an early age, of Dolly, the first cloned sheep, that made me think of the issue of scrapie because I was very interested in the scheme set up by the Minister for Agriculture and Food last year. Scrapie is a fatal degenerative disease affecting the central nervous system of sheep and goats. It is one of the diseases classified as transmissable spongiform encephalopathies. Infected flocks which contain a high percentage of susceptible animals can experience significant production losses. There has been increased attention paid to scrapie, which has been known for more than 250 years, since the link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in people and feline spongiform encephalopathy in cats became known in the recent past.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">The cause of scrapie is not definitely known. It could be a small virus or prion but it is known that some sheep are less susceptible to infection than others. With advances in genetics, the genotype of those sheep can be ascertained and efforts made to ensure these are the flocks where breeding for the national flock is promoted. Wisely, the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced a programme on the genotyping of sheep last July. This programme, which is voluntary, requires the genotyping and identification of resistant animals and the tracking of their movement off-farm. If we could say the national flock was scrapie free, it would be a splendid selling point in the promotion of the sale of our lamb, both at home and abroad. I would be glad if the Minister of State would tell me what progress is being made on this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">Senator Quinn brought up a related issue on the Order of Business today. Seeing that the removal of the subsidy for the export of meat and bonemeal to renderers who destroy all the offal and bone from potentially infected animals is imminent, can the Minister of State tell me what it is proposed can be done with this material? There is no sale for it here, we have no incinerator in which to burn it and could have to resort to very expensive storage again.</p>

          <p eId="para_519">I appreciate the fact that Senator Henry has raised this matter and given me the opportunity of addressing it. I immediately take her point on meat and bonemeal, an issue debated in the Dáil last week and at which the Government is looking as it has cost the State a substantial amount of money. We export more than 90% of our agricultural produce and have got into marketplaces abroad because of our disease free reputation. We have looked at the different options and the matter is of grave concern to me. I have initiated an investigation which is ongoing in the Department.</p>

          <from>Mr. Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_521">Senators will be aware that the profile of scrapie increased dramatically in recent years because of its possible association with BSE. While scrapie is a disease of sheep without any known human health dimension, it is also one of a family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs, of which BSE is a member.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">While there is no evidence that sheep can be infected with BSE under natural conditions, we do know that sheep injected with BSE material under experimental conditions exhibited clinical symptoms which were almost identical to scrapie. We also know that scientists in Europe are working on the development of differential tests which would distinguish between the scrapie and BSE agents and that such tests, although not yet finally approved by the EU scientific steering committee, are being used to test scrapie positive samples in the United Kingdom for BSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Against this background and in the absence of any horizontal measures for dealing with the disease at EU level, the priority accorded in Ireland to dealing with scrapie increased over the past two years. We have adopted a multi-strand policy involving depopulation of infected flocks, active surveillance and a scrapie genotyping experiment with a limited number of flocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">In relation to genotyping, my Department has been aware for some time that the degree of susceptibility to scrapie appears to be linked to genotype and of the possibility that programmes for breeding for resistance might be used as a strategy against the disease. This issue has been the subject of considerable debate at the EU scientific steering committee, where there was some doubt as to whether genetic resistance simply meant that the resistant animals, though carrying the infective agent, did not exhibit clinical symptoms.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">I am pleased to say that from a policy perspective the debate at EU level has now developed with the promulgation of regulations requiring member states to conduct a genetic survey of native pedigree breeds by 1 October 2003, to put voluntary breeding programmes in place for such breeds by 1 January 2004 and allowing, with effect from 1 October 2003, for strategies for dealing with infected flocks ranging from full depopulaton with a prohibition on using the land for sheep for a period of three years, to genotyping and partial depopulation of flocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">My Department is making arrangements for the provision of a genotyping service for pedigree breeders, in particular. A gene sequencer has been purchased and staff have been engaged to assist with the commissioning of the machine and the verification of the techniques to be used. This process involved the testing of samples and liaison with the laboratory of the Government chemist in the United Kingdom and the Government laboratory in the Netherlands to ensure consistency of results. On the operational side, work is proceeding on the development of appropriate literature, certificates and a database to record applications and results and monitor the movements of animals with resistant genotypes. In this regard also, I am aware that a commercial operator is involved in developing arrangements for the provision of a genotyping service. This is something I welcome and which would be of great assistance to the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">We have written to pedigree breed societies to obtain information for a database of pedigree flocks in the country and will shortly be in a position to commence the survey of each pedigree native breed required under the new EU regulations. As well as fulfilling the requirements of the new regulations, this survey will provide a valuable mechanism for validating the operational systems in place and ironing out any logistical problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Substantial progress has been made, therefore, in the preparations for a genotyping programme. I will consult the farming community, as I do on a regular basis, and keep farmers and other interested parties, including this House, informed of further progress in the coming weeks. I hope I will soon have progress to report. Although I come from an agricultural background, this is a matter of which I was not keenly aware and which is new to most in the Department. We hear of new diseases on a daily basis. We must undertake the necessary research before we can put in place the operations necessary to deal with them. What we have done heretofore has been successful. We have to protect the reputation of our food industry and, given that we export more than 90%, that is what is most important to all.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Hospital Services.</heading>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_530">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I also thank the Minister of State for being present. Will he indicate his future plans for the retention and development of maternity services at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe?</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Following the leaking of the draft report of the national task force on medical manpower last weekend, there is concern and anger in Ballinasloe, County Galway, among the staff and those who have had contact with the hospital in the past. The terms of reference of the task force clearly indicate concern in that it has to co-ordinate the implementation of a new model of hospital service delivery. Effectively, what it means is the downgrading of Portiuncula Hospital to associate hospital status. That is unacceptable, given that it is only 12 months since some Members here and the Western Health Board acquired the hospital from the Franciscan Sisters. It is also unacceptable that the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board, Dr. Sheelagh Ryan, and her senior officer, the regional manager for acute services, are both on this task force. It is unacceptable in any shape or form, including that of the dual mandate, that the chief executive officer charged with the delivery of the service on behalf of the Minister within the Western Health Board in which this hospital is located can comfortably sit on a task force whose remit is clearly to rationalise and downgrade the hospital.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_534">I am speaking about an office. I ask that that officer vacate that particular position as a matter of urgency in order to avoid a conflict of interest and give a clear commitment as to the priorities of the delivery of service as a chief executive officer of a health board. It is important not to have such a conflict of interest. It suppresses the energies of that person to deliver the services she is charged with, on one hand, while, on the other, she is being charged with responsibility to undertake downgrading of the other offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Portiuncula Hospital has an outstanding history of delivery of maternity and accident and emergency services. If it is downgraded, after a period of one year under the auspices of the Western Health Board, it will give a warning light to other hospitals that may be in a similar position to have nothing to do with health boards taking over and acquiring private hospitals with the intention of maintaining services into the future. It is of the utmost importance that the Minister of State indicates a firm commitment to develop and maintain maternity services and accident and emergency services in Portiuncula Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">There are 30 maternity beds in Portiuncula Hospital, at which there were 1,800 births last year. If, at the behest of a task force, a Minister can eliminate that service in a hospital that serves a catchment area extending from Longford, Westmeath, Athlone, Roscommon, Offaly to east Galway, we are toying with a situation where there will be a repeat of what happened in Monaghan. Will the Minister of State give a clear indication of the Government's intention regarding the continuation and development of maternity and accident and emergency services in Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinalsoe?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_537">The issue raised by the Senator was the subject of numerous recent newspaper articles. The articles refer to the national task force on medical staffing. The report has yet to be completed. The work of the task force is ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">My record is quite good in relation to the retention of hospitals rather than their closure. Equally, that is the record of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. There are no plans to close maternity hospitals or general hospitals. I am concerned at what is clearly an unauthorised leak by somebody who seems to be irresponsible. The Senator mentioned the downgrading of Portiuncula Hospital and said the remit of the group was to rationalise and downgrade. That conclusion is totally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, is providing high quality acute hospital care for the people in the area. The Minister has recently invested in the development of the hospital, including the provision of a new theatre and a stroke care unit. The hospital will continue to deliver acute public hospital services in the region and will grow with the development of health services in the region. That is the current plan. I am happy to have the opportunity to come before the House to put that on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I will now give some background to the task force so that we know where we are going in relation to the development of hospital services. Among the key developments required in the development of medical staffing in the coming years are: the provision of a consultant-provided, rather than a consultant-led service; the implementation of EU requirements that non-consultant hospital doctors should work no longer than an average of 48 hours per week by 2009; and the achievement of a range of improvements in medical training and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">In recent years a framework for addressing these needs has emerged: the report of the working group on non-consultant hospital doctors' working hours; the report of the medical manpower forum; implementation of the 1997 agreement on a 65 hour working week for non-consultant hospital doctors; implementation of the non-consultant hospital doctors' 2000 agreement on overtime, which is ongoing and includes the work of the medical manpower managers appointed under this agreement; and the work of the national task force on medical staffing, which is also ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The Minister for Health and Children established the national task force on medical staffing to prepare and cost an implementation plan for a new approach to hospital services, based on appropriately trained doctors providing patients with the highest quality service. The task force is chaired by Mr. David Hanley. The key work of the task force is: to oversee the implementation of detailed strategies for reducing the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors so that the 48 hour working week is achieved by 1 August 2009 and 58 hours by 1 August 2004; address the associated medical staffing needs of the hospital system; analyse the practicalities and estimate the costs that would arise if a consultant-provided, rather than a consultant-led, system was in place; and consider the medical education and training requirements arising from any changes to the current model of delivering services.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">To make recommendations on how to achieve a 48 hour working week and a consultant provided service, the task force has had to look considerably beyond the services provided by consultants and the NCHDs alone. It has been considering the delivery of services throughout the hospital system with full regard to the interactions with primary care and long-term care services. It has, therefore, met not only consultants and NCHDs but also other health professionals, including nurses, management, other clinical disciplines, general practitioners and other primary care providers. Over the last year it has had over 300 consultative meetings; received 60 written responses from pilot regions; been engaged in detailed analysis of material from detailed questionnaires issued to each department of each hospital in the pilot regions, and analysed detailed material from management questionnaires.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">A key element of the work of the task force is the study of a number of pilot sites to assess the nature and practical implications of the changes required. It was decided that it would be necessary to examine the staffing and functioning of a large general teaching hospital in its capacity as the regional centre for a health board area with a population of 300,000. In this context, two sites were selected, the East Coast Area Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board and the hospitals located in their two health board areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">The task force report will make recommendations regarding the number of consultants and NCHDs required to achieve a consultant provided service and a 48 hour working week for NCHDs. The national task force on medical staffing is completing its report which the Minister will consider in detail when he receives it and then bring proposals to Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_553">I wish to raise the condition of St. Coman's ward, a medical ward, in Roscommon County Hospital, an issue I raised in the autumn of 2002 because the contract for the refurbishment of and improvements to the ward had been submitted to the Department in June 2002. A further submission was made on 9 August 2002. It is time for the Department to approve the acceptance of the contract by the Western Health Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I am grateful to the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, for approving major developments at the hospital in 1998. I am equally grateful to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for his continued commitment to the hospital which allowed me, as chairman of the Western Health Board, on 16 May 2002, the day before the general election, to sign the contract worth about €5.5 million for a new accident and emergency department which will be a state-of-the-art facility. Work is well under way by the contractor, Tommy Connolly and Sons, and the building will be completed later this year or in early 2004. This is a major development which will be a hospital within a hospital with nine beds and all the required facilities. It is vital that an accident and emergency consultant is appointed when the building is completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I also signed a contract on 27 June – I finished work on 30 June – worth €1.1 million for the refurbishment of the theatres. This work is now completed and provides excellent accommodation for surgery to continue at the hospital with two excellent surgeons. We have also provided new screening rooms and other facilities and upgraded the surgical wards. In 1995, 24 rehabilitation beds with links to the hospital were commissioned in the Sacred Heart Hospital. In 1997 educational seminar and conference facilities were provided and in December 1998 new surgical facilities opened at the hospital at a capital cost of €760,000. This provided additional beds. In May 2000 approval was given to upgrade the hospital drainage system, which work has been carried out. All in all, these were welcome developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">The condition of St. Coman's ward is far below the standard required in a modern hospital. It is extremely difficult for consultant physicians and nursing staff to work in such conditions. More importantly, it is totally unsuitable for patients being treated in the hospital. It is of a standard which I know the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, and the Minister, Deputy Martin, would not accept. I intend to raise the matter as often as I am allowed on the basis that it is of fundamental importance that this facility is upgraded bearing in mind that we have carried out and continue to carry out wonderful work at the hospital which will ensure its continued use as an acute general hospital providing medical, surgical and psychiatric facilities to the highest possible standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The hospital is a fine building, on which my father worked as a stone mason and which was built in the 1940s. St. Coman's ward has not been refurbished since. It is certainly substandard. The Health and Safety Authority would have serious reservations about its continued use as a medical ward. Work has been completed in the theatres and is under way on the accident and emergency department. Therefore, this is a timely opportunity for the Department to allow the Western Health Board to accept tenders for the contract to allow the work to proceed. I guarantee the Minister of State that we would then have a top class hospital. As a Member of the Seanad and former chairman of the Western Health Board, I would be delighted to ensure the work would be carried out as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">As outlined in November 2002, my Department and I fully appreciate and are aware of the service Roscommon County Hospital provides for the people of County Roscommon. I was not aware the Senator's father was one of the stone masons who worked on the building. The Senator has been very much involved in the delivery, enhancement and improvement of services at the hospital since his father put the first stones in place. The Senator and the people of County Roscommon are aware that the hospital has served the community well in providing health services in surgery, medicine, geriatric assessment and psychiatry as well as casualty and out-patient services. The Senator was involved in ensuring the budget for the hospital increased to €14 million this year, more than double the level in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Mainly arising from a number of representations made by the Senator, the hospital has benefited from a number of developments during the years. In December 1991 St. Teresa's ward was opened providing 16 additional beds. In February 1992 a new acute psychiatric unit was opened while in 1993 a consultant with an interest in the elderly was appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">In 1994, 24 rehabilitation beds with linkages to the hospital were commissioned at the Sacred Heart Home in Roscommon. In 1997, educational, seminar and conference facilities for all the county's health services were provided with the refurbishment and renovation of the training centre at Roscommon County Hospital. In December 1998, new surgical facilities at the hospital were opened at a capital cost of €760,000. This provided for five additional beds, hospice accommodation, renovation of the surgical ward and an increase in single room accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">In 1999, a second consultant surgeon took up duty at the hospital. In May 2000, the hospital's drainage system was upgraded at a capital cost of €246,000. In May 2001, the doctors' residences were refurbished at a capital cost of more than €57,000. In June 2001, when the Minister visited the hospital, he provided €1.65 million to carry out additional capital works at the hospital. The screening room equipment has been replaced and the theatre department is being upgraded. It was hoped that St. Coman's ward would be accommodated in that €1.65 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">In April 2002, the Minister issued approval to accept the tender for the development of a new accident and emergency department, nine bed admissions unit, medical records department, radiology film storage, staff changing facilities and ultrasound room, at an estimated capital cost of more than €7.8 million. Construction is under way, with an estimated completion date of later on this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">As can be seen from the list of developments I have outlined, the Government is committed to the development of facilities at Roscommon County Hospital. In particular, the development of surgical services has enabled the hospital to increase its day surgery work. My Department is very aware that St. Coman's ward is in need of upgrading. Plans have been agreed with the Western Health Board design team, local management and their technical services department. Unfortunately, the Western Health Board is unable to provide the funding for this project from within the funding of €1.65 million provided by the Minister last year. The funding provided has been utilised to purchase new X-ray equipment and refurbish the operating theatre.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">My Department is currently reviewing, from a national point of view, the national development plan for the health sector generally in light of the outturn position for 2002. This process involves providing for existing capital contractual commitments and commencing, where possible, the planning or construction of new projects nationally in 2003 or beyond. It is in this context that capital developments for the Western Health Board region, including the proposed developments at Roscommon County Hospital, are being considered. When the review is completed, the Western Health Board will be advised of the position in relation to the funding of further developments at Roscommon County Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">I greatly appreciate the particular and special interest in this issue of my good friend and colleague, Senator Leyden. I will certainly take note of his question tonight and come back to him as soon as the position is clearer.</p>

          <p eId="para_566">I thank the Minister of State for his contribution. There is no doubt the Government has shown a clear commitment to the hospital because of its large investments since it was built in the 1940s. However, in order to complete the process, it needs a small capital investment. I am heartened by the words of the Minister of State and I would like him personally to take the matter on board in the Department. It would be a shame not to complete the work at the hospital and I look forward to seeing the Minister of State there in the near future.</p>
