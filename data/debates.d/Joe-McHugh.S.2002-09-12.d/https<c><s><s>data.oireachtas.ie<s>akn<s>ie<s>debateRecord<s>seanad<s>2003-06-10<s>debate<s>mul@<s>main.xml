        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_9">I wish to raise two matters on the Order of Business. Last week the European Central Bank decided to reduce interest rates by 0.5% throughout the eurozone. Members will be aware that the three biggest banks have failed to pass on this reduction to domestic borrowers and those with mortgages. Will the Leader make time available this week for a debate with the Minister for Finance in order that we might discover what the Government intends to do about this matter? The banks are privately-owned businesses and the amount of direct intervention in which the Government can engage is quite small.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">All the moral indignation under the sun will not make much difference to these banks unless a firm decision is taken by the Government to reduce or stop some of the benefits that the State gives them on a constant basis. One of these benefits is the involvement of the State's security forces in the transfer of large sums of money, which is done for the banking groups at a hugely reduced cost. The Government should consider the postponement of any discussions with the Irish Bankers' Federation until the reduction in interest rates has been passed on to customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Is the Leader aware that next Tuesday an Oireachtas XV will take on the Police Service of Northern Ireland in a friendly football match? This is a unique sporting occasion. Is she aware that Sinn Féin, the alleged republican party on this island, is intent on staging a protest about the match?</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_16">I also wish to ask the Leader to arrange a debate on interest rates. There is no monopoly of wisdom on one side of the House as opposed to the other in respect of this issue. I would like Members to place their views on record and give a clear message. Will the Leader consider arranging such a debate for tomorrow? I will propose an amendment to tomorrow's Order of Business on that issue. The greed and avarice we have seen are unacceptable. It is also important that the debate should not just be about the interest rate, because competitiveness, which we have discussed on many occasions, is being undermined. We have mentioned many times that inflation is being worsened. It is bad for economic growth and development in many ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">In the course of the discussions on the national agreement and, in this House, on budgets I have asked many times for the rate of corporation tax not to be reduced. When the Government refused to move in this regard and decided to reduce the rate for other forms of business, I pleaded with it not to do so in relation to banks and financial services. This is the thanks taxpayers are given in response to the gifts they give. I would like a full debate on the matter and ask the Leader to consider it. While I hope to propose an amendment to tomorrow's Order of Business, I would prefer if time could be found in advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">According to today's Order of Business, there will be a debate on Europe between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. while the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003 will be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. If the first debate does not continue until 6 p.m., would it be possible for the Bill to be taken immediately after the discussion on the Convention on the Future of Europe?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_19">I agree with Senators who have asked for a debate on the failure of the three large banks to reduce interest rates in line with the ECB reduction last week. It is important that the issue of the lack of responsibility taken by the banks in relation to the economy is debated. Many householders across the country will be affected hugely by this decision. I am not sure that the Minister for Finance should come here for the debate because he seems to take a very <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to this issue. Judging from his remarks at the weekend, he seems to think the market will decide but I am not sure that will happen. It seems that we need more power in order that we can have a far more interventionist role.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Will the Leader ask Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach, or whoever will make the decision, when the health reports will be published? The Minister for Health and Children said last week that the reports would be published within two weeks but the Minister for Finance said at the weekend that it may take longer. I ask the Leader to ensure the reports are published before this House rises in a few weeks' time as we have waited long enough for them. It is important that we debate their contents as they affect the entire health service and many people throughout the country. The Government will abdicate its responsibilities if it arranges that the reports are not published before the House goes into recess.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_21">The Leader of the House has agreed, in principle, to have a debate on the Forfás report in early July. In advance of that debate, I call on the Leader to ask the Tánaiste to instruct the Competition Authority to carry out an immediate investigation into the pricing of oil and diesel in the Irish market by the major companies. The prices of such products do not reflect the great difference between the values of the dollar and the euro. I compliment the <i>Irish Independent</i> for publishing a price list in today's edition and commend those in Reynolds' service station, Castletownroche, where unleaded petrol costs 79.9 cent per litre.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">I would like to bring to the Leader's attention once more people with intellectual and other disabilities, many of whom were outside the gates of Leinster House today to try to highlight their difficulties. It is time the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science came to the House to discuss these issues, particularly in the light of the cutbacks that many families have to endure. There have been cutbacks in respite care and provision for young adults over the age of 18 years. There have also been cutbacks in personal assistance for many people with disabilities which will leave many in outrageous circumstances. We should have a discussion on this matter, notwithstanding the fact that there will be statements on autism tomorrow night. This is a most grave issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">Will the Leader indicate when the landlord and tenant Bill will come before the House? I hope the Government will reconsider the position in respect of the legislation. If not, I will do my best to have it amended because of the most astonishing notion it contains regarding the protection of landlords who do not make proper declarations of tax. This will be done by making it impossible for the Revenue to gain access to information that is gathered by this group. Revenue should have access to such information. I am aware of many situations where full disclosure for tax purposes is not made and that is a scandal. We should not be going down this avenue and I hope the Government will amend the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">From the schedule of business for this week, I understand that there may be statements on Iraq tomorrow. I do not wish to jump the gun, but will the Leader indicate whether she will accept the suggestion I made that we use this procedure to pass the resolution tabled by the Independents? I used extremely mild wording in the resolution to ensure that it would not cause offence and in order to encourage its acceptance. It requests that the Minister for Foreign Affairs ensure that the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States live up to their obligations under the Geneva Convention, etc., in terms of assisting civilian casualties of war. The resolution was passed unanimously by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, but it would strengthen our hand if it was also passed by the Seanad. I do not believe that it contains anything which might prove overly offensive, it should not be too controversial and it would be of assistance to those of us interested in the continuing situation in Iraq if it could be passed. I do not know if the Leader will agree to that. Perhaps she could inform us of the position in the morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">Will the Leader – who had a most distinguished career in the area – speak to the relevant Minister about transport issues, about which the House has had many debates? Let us consider some of the details. I referred previously to the anomalies in speed limits. A recent journey took me across the West Link toll bridge. There are ten lanes through which vehicles may pass at the toll booth. On the day in question, the first lane was closed, the next three were Eazy Pass only, no change was given at the next lane, the next two lanes were also Eazy Pass, there was a girl in the next lane putting money into a basket and the last lane had no markings. I went right across to the girl with the basket, but she would not give me any change. It may seem silly, but if every second person is giving 70 cent to National Toll Roads, it will make a huge amount of money. It has already swindled the people of Ireland by—</p>

          <p eId="para_41">I join colleagues on the other side of the House in asking for a debate, at the earliest opportunity, in regard to the debacle with interest rates. What we have seen in recent days, from two, perhaps three, of the main banks, is particularly disappointing. The banks have a responsibility to their customers as well as to their stockholders. There is some concern about the profits that the banks might lose as a result of this. However, they are currently making astronomical profits and the small percentage that would be involved in giving the customers what they deserve would be appreciated. Their current stance is undermining the credibility of the ECB. While this is not specifically a Government issue, the views of this House might assist in pointing the banks towards their moral obligation to the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">On numerous occasions in the past ten weeks I have asked the Leader to intercede on behalf of members of the farming community – particularly those who live on the west coast – who have suffered severe losses as a result of the ongoing strike. It is difficult to surmise the Department's position in regard to this matter and a serious situation has developed. We have seen senior officers in the veterinary section defying the Minister's wishes regarding the provision of permits for farmers who want to move diseased herds off the farm, or sell healthy livestock.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">It is essential that the Leader should request the Minister to attend the House to indicate what he intends to do about this ongoing problem. Farmers in the west have suffered serious losses, particularly in the spring and now in the summer when harvesting has become very difficult because cattle have to be retained on the farm. As you are aware, a Chathaoirligh, heretofore if a farmer kept a diseased animal on his or her farm for one day, he or she would have been liable to imprisonment. Now, however, diseased animals are being held on farms in the west with the blessing of the Minister. I am asking the Leader to intercede as a matter of urgency to request the Minister to attend the House for a debate on this issue.</p>

In recent times there has been much concern about accidents that have taken place as a result of oil spillages and it is thought that the regulations need to be enforced fully or, perhaps, changed. A very dangerous incident occurred today in Mulhuddart, as a result of which people are still in hospital. Will the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, or whichever Minister has responsibility in this regard, attend the House to indicate whether the regulations are being enforced fully or need to be updated? What efforts can be made to reduce the oil spillages causing serious accidents and environmental damage?</p>

          <p eId="para_46">You, a Chathaoirligh, and other Senators will have received the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation's statement, published by Forfás, on embedding the pharmaceutical and chemical sector in Ireland. This is an important statement because the pharmaceutical and chemical industries are our main exporters. At the same time, however, the Government fixes the prices of pharmaceutical and chemical products used in the supply of drugs for the health service, and they are among the highest in Europe. Will the Leader organise a debate with the relevant Minister – whether it is the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, or the Minister for Health and Children – to see how much the health service is helping to embed the very profitable pharmaceutical industry? The health service has dire financial problems while private patients have to pay very high prices for drugs. I would be grateful if the Leader could bring this matter to the attention of the relevant Minister with a view to having a debate on the issue in the House.</p>

Given the number of suicides we have seen occurring around the country, including in my locality, the debate should be broadened in order to debunk the misguided stigma attached to mental health. A recent UCD survey showed that only 13% of students who suffered from stress availed of counselling, far too low a level. We should play our part in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">It would be appropriate for the House to endorse the Government's case against Sellafield which is being taken in the Hague. In the last Seanad we had many debates during which all sides of the House advocated stronger Government action to counter the dangerous risks posed by British Nuclear Fuels' operations at Sellafield. The House should wish the Government well in its efforts which we hope will be successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">On a day when the taxi industry is organising a major protest, it is worth noting that the State's record in moving from quantitative to qualitative controls in the transport sector has been abysmal. It is unacceptable that a criminal element has been allowed to infiltrate the taxi industry to such an extent. There is a need for the regulatory authorities to take appropriate action to ensure this does not happen. The taxi industry is very important to the economic life of this city and country. We should say what is happening in the industry is unacceptable and that strong action should be taken to eradicate the problem.</p>

I believed that, as good Europeans, once the ECB had moved, the main banks would have been the first to lead. I am intrigued as to the possible reasons for non-implementation. As the Taoiseach said, there is a moral imperative on the financial institutions to reduce rates. I would like to hear the Leader's views in this regard. I am sure the House would be totally united in the matter. There should no be further delay on the part of the financial institutions because it will impact adversely on our competitiveness.</p>

I received a complaint recently from a restaurant owner where a container moved into the car park and very reluctantly moved away. A very offensive smelling liquid was oozing from it. This is not good at a time of the year when we are trying to attract tourists. There should be strict enforcement of the regulations which some operators totally disregard.</p>

I was stunned to learn yesterday that 300,000 provisional driving licences had been issued and that there is a six month waiting list for the driving test. The Government has not focused its attention on doing something about this. There are reciprocal arrangements with other countries such as Australia and South Africa whereby people who come from these countries do not have to do a test here but they do not apply to Canada and the United States. I do not understand this. If there are reciprocal arrangements in place, surely they should apply to Canada and the United States from where a substantial number of Irish people come here to live. They must undergo a test, including an eye test and so on. We should be focusing our attention on reducing the number of provisional licences. I gather there are in the region of 130,000 waiting to do the test.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">To follow on Senator Hanafin's comments on the problem of stress, figures were published yesterday in Britain on the cause of strokes and heart attacks.

We also have nurses on strike in the Midland Health Board area because of the intolerable conditions under which some elderly persons must live.

          <p eId="para_68">Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of the ECB and the refusal to date of the three major banks to reduce their loan rates. It was interesting that a spokesperson for one of them said it was not "in the capacity" of the bank to reduce its rates. I cannot understand this. Such language seems most odd. Withholding such reductions is piracy. One is reminded of the remark made by the disgraced New York businesswoman, Leona Helmsley, "Only the little people pay taxes." On a previous occasion I contacted the Irish Bankers Federation and will do so again. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes and others who made the point about loan rates. I also agree with the Taoiseach who said the banks had a moral obligation to reduce them, which remark was correctly echoed in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Senator Brian Hayes also spoke about the Oireachtas team which is to take on a PSNI team in a football match, and a planned protest. I did not hear about the protest of which the Senator spoke but imagine the Oireachtas team will be well able to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Senator O'Toole urged that banks should not be exempt from corporation tax rate reductions. Clearly, this is the slap in the face we get as a result. The Senator requested that the debate on the matter take place tomorrow. I will consider the timetable to see if it can be accommodated. Senator O'Toole also asked that if statements on the Convention of Europe reached an early conclusion, the Protection of Employees (Fixed Work Bill) be taken immediately. However, I understand that the Minister will not be available until 6 p.m. I hope that the statements will not conclude early.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">Senator O'Meara asked for a debate on interest rates. She also raised the issue of the three health reports. We have asked on several occasions that the reports be published and I heard the Minister say they would be debated before the Houses go into recess. We will seek to have the reports debated in this House in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Senator Leyden is moving on with his crusade of name and shame and indicated that he has some interesting names to reveal.

          <p eId="para_89">The Senator also requested a tax on salt, too much of which in one's diet can lead to a heart attack or a stroke. There is salt in every foodstuff one buys, even before one is tempted to pour the contents of a salt cellar over one's food. However, I am not sure if there would be much support for imposing a tax on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">Senator McHugh called for a debate on employment centred on an employment strategy to be developed, particularly for the north-western region, while Senator Bannon called for a debate with the Minister for Health and Children on the public health doctors' dispute which has been referred to the Labour Relations Commission on several occasions but progress does not seem to have been made on resolving it.

        <heading>Convention on the Future of Europe: Statements.</heading>
        <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_54">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_100">I welcome this opportunity to talk about the Convention and developments in that regard. Our meeting today is particularly opportune in that the Convention is in its final week. We will have a final document within the next seven to ten days for presentation at the meeting of the European Council in Thessalonika.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">It might be useful to recall the way the Convention was established and what it set out to do. It was asked to establish a more precise delimitation of powers between the European Union and member states, reflecting, in particular, the principle of subsidiarity. It was also asked to examine the status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proclaimed at Nice, and how it could be incorporated into a future constitutional treaty. It was asked to simplify the treaties with a view to making them clearer, more understandable and easier to read without changing their meaning. It was also asked to examine the role of national parliaments in terms of the European architecture. It has gone a long way towards achieving these aims.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">I strongly believe the Convention has been a success to date. As a result of its work, the European Union will be much better equipped to meet the challenges and take the opportunities enlargement will bring. It will also be much better equipped as a result of the work of the Convention to meet the expectations of citizens of the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">The new draft is in four parts. Part I represents the "constitutional" elements, the broad principles of how the Union operates and its values, objectives and institutional framework. This part is the constitutional heart of the new treaty. Part II contains the Charter of Fundamental Rights and is a stand-alone part. It will contain the charter which will incorporate the horizontal provisions. While we are still finalising the details, we expect it will also include a bridging reference to commentary on the charter. Part III contains the detail of the Union's policies while Part IV sets out the general and final provisions, especially regarding ratification and future amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">There is no doubt that the draft produced is simpler than previous treaties. Its structure is clear and much more comprehensible. The new constitutional treaty will contain much that should be welcomed by citizens. The convention has worked hard to address the evident disconnection between the European Union and its citizens. The aims and objectives of the Union are set out clearly and more concisely than has been the case heretofore. Decision-making is to be simplified greatly while the number of legislative instruments will be dramatically reduced. I remind the House that an incredible 15 separate legislative instruments are used by the European Union. When the new constitutional treaty takes effect, there will only be five.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The fundamental nature of the European Union as a union of states and peoples is underlined and maintained. There has been no significant shift in competence, but the division of competence between member states and the Union has been made clearer. The role of national parliaments in the life of the Union has been recognised and they will be given an enhanced role in monitoring respect for the principle of subsidiarity. I was disappointed to some degree in this area in that I also hoped they would play a key role in the election of the President of the European Commission. These are changes that I believe will be welcomed in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The Convention proposes the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the constitutional treaty. Much work has been done by the Government in the Convention to clarify the scope and application of the charter, to ensure its incorporation confers no new competencies and that it applies only to the EU institutions and member states and only when implementing EU law. It will not affect the domestic legal orders of member states. This is an important issue in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">With only a week remaining to conclude its work, much of the focus has been on trying to resolve the outstanding institutional questions. The leader of the Convention has been criticised for leaving institutional matters to a very late stage. We all recognise a political tactic when we see it. Throughout the convention process, the Government tried to be flexible and open to change as long as the key principles of balance and equality were respected. We worked closely with partners in the Convention to achieve this balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">As the House will recall, there was much criticism of the original proposals on the institutions brought forward by the Praesidium. They did not meet the key tests of equality between member states and decidedly did not meet the key test of balance between the institutions. While we have yet to see final texts, the latest proposals seem to be a considerable improvement and go a long way towards rectifying the imbalances in the original and earlier draft texts. They also retain most of what was agreed in the Treaty of Nice a short time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">Equality of access to the membership of the European Commission has been guaranteed. This is the single most important result of the negotiations in the past seven days. While it is proposed that there will be 15 voting members within the Commission rotating on the basis of strict equality as defined in the Nice treaty, all member states will be entitled to have a nominee in the Commission. It is important to emphasise this point because naysayers in this country are trying to persuade us that black is white and words mean something other than what they mean. Equality means equality and translates into all the working languages of the Community. There are some wording issues on which we are still negotiating. The Leader knows this is one of the reasons I am anxious to travel to Brussels this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">While it looks as though there will be a long-term elected president of the European Council, his or her functions are to be so defined as not to cut across those of the Commission. This is a particularly important point. If the institutional balance is to be retained, some of the more exotic ideas about a crossover between the presidency of the Commission and the Council and <i>vice versa</i> would have to be avoided.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">The principle of rotation in other formations of the Council, the so-called Council of Ministers sector meetings, is set to be inscribed in the new constitutional treaty. This is important as the idea of rotation in the Council of Ministers is fundamental in illustrating equality to citizens in a clear and recognisable way. I argued strongly in favour of this, as did a majority of current and future member states. I firmly believe the benefits of rotation far outweigh the problems and I am pleased that these arguments have been taken on board. We will have to see the final text before we can proclaim that we have won on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">I also welcome the restoration of the deal agreed at Nice on the size and composition of the European Parliament. Members will be aware of the debate which took place on this issue last week. There had been deadlock on Nice treaty related issues in the Praesidium. By demanding votes in the national representatives group we were able to ensure there was no doubt the vast majority wanted to retain the institutional areas outlined in the Nice deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">There are some outstanding institutional issues which will be discussed later this week, both in meetings of the component parts of the Convention – national representatives, national parliamentarians, Members of the European Parliament and the Commission – and in the plenary. Ongoing discussion is likely on the definition of qualified majority voting and the question of a legislative council. I am not convinced that a legislative council would serve any purpose. It would create a great deal of confusion and run counter to good organisational arrangements within member states. National representative groups voted on this issue last week and only two countries indicated any interest in the proposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">In general terms, however, substantial progress has been made on these issues which were of concern to this Parliament. We should welcome what has been done to date. The Convention has not sought to alter the basic mix of policies which have served Ireland and the European Union well such as the Common Agricultural Policy and the Internal Market. As Members will be aware, proposals have been brought forward in the areas of justice and home affairs, foreign policy and defence. While we have made some progress in these areas, discussions are continuing and some of the issues are likely to be revisited in the Intergovernmental Conference where it has been suggested that no changes should be made. Unless there is absolute agreement in the Convention, it is not possible to suggest that no amendments will be made at the Intergovernmental Conference. We will undoubtedly see changes in the areas of justice and home affairs, foreign policy and defence. Taxation is an area in which we will continue to oppose moves towards harmonisation and qualified majority voting. We have worked closely with a number of partners, both current and future, in this area to ensure it is clear that this is an issue of paramount importance to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">The Convention has done a great deal of good work over the past 16 months. I am sure that its report to the European Council will receive a broad welcome from EU leaders. It is important to note, however, that much more work needs to be done, some of which will be done at the Intergovernmental Conference, which is not to say anything negative about the Convention. The report will form, in large part, the basis for the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference that will follow in the autumn. At the same time, it is important to remember that the constitutional treaty will still only be in draft form and that it is highly likely that all Governments will have concerns that they will wish to revisit at the Intergovernmental Conference. The Government will give the final report of the Convention its most careful and detailed consideration with a view to ensuring any points of concern it identifies will be examined at the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">It will also use the interval between the end of the Convention and start of the Intergovernmental Conference to try to ensure that citizens are aware of the Convention's report and its true content. The agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference will largely determine its length. It cannot be ruled out that it will extend into Ireland's EU Presidency – the more agreement there is at the Convention, the shorter the Intergovernmental Conference should be. If that is the case, the Government will be honoured to take its work forward and, if necessary, conclude it.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">The Convention concludes its work this week. I reiterate that I believe it has been a tremendous success. It has made substantial progress in a wide range of areas that might have been deemed unthinkable. Six or seven months ago, it did not seem likely that we would reach this point. Its final report this week should have the broad support of the Convention as a whole and we will have solid foundations on which to base the work of the Intergovernmental Conference later this year. All of these positive aspects, however, are in contrast to the fact that we still do not have final texts. We will have to wait until we see these. As Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe once said, it is not the devil that is in the details but God – even if he has not made his appearance so far in the preamble.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">I pay tribute to my colleagues Deputy John Bruton, who has done extraordinarily good work in the Praesidium, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, Deputies Gormley and Carey and my alternate, Bobby McDonagh, all of whom have done extraordinary work. Such work is not often recognised in this country, where we are more inclined to be cynical than to give praise. A huge amount of good work has been done. We have been able to fight for the issues that are significant to this country, while being prepared to listen to others and to work to bring forward improvements in the institutional and constitutional framework of Europe. Our job is not yet done – we cannot pat ourselves on the back – but hard work has been put into this and the country has not been let down.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_55">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_119">I appreciate that the Minister of State is under pressure in terms of time and I do not propose to delay him unduly. As the work of the Convention nears its conclusion, I join him in thanking everybody for their efforts to date. I thank the Minister of State for bringing energy, commitment and passion to this job, the results of which, it is to be hoped, will be fruitful.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">As the Convention concludes, the agenda will pass on to the Intergovernmental Conference. However, a firm foundation has been laid down by the Minister of State and his colleagues. The Irish team has done an excellent job and should be congratulated. I thank Deputy Bruton, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, Deputies Carey and Gormley and others on a job well done. This is an example of how well an Irish team can work for the country abroad. It causes one to reflect that if we could get our politicians in Leinster House to work as closely and effectively on domestic matters – such as health and education – and if we worked towards a common agenda, we would have a much better country.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">I am pleased that, judging from the most recent drafts of the Convention's work, we have secured major concessions during the negotiations on a new EU constitution and treaty. It is important that this success be fully explained and transmitted to the public because we will again call on it in the near future to vote for the next European Union treaty. After the difficulties we had with the two votes on Nice, we must recognise, politically, that while the Irish voter is well disposed to the European project, there is no automatic right to have any EU treaty passed by the Irish public in a referendum. The Government will have to keep the public abreast of the progress of an EU constitution and keep the issues involved on the public agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">I do not want to be too party political, but it is inevitable that when we come to vote on the new EU treaty, the country may not see the Government parties shining at their brightest in terms of domestic matters. In the midst of the political ebb and flow, it may not be the best time for the Government. It will be important at that stage, as it was in the second Nice treaty referendum, that the main Opposition parties, particularly my party, Fine Gael, with its long and proud tradition of support for the European ideal, will play a leading role in the campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">The most recent proposals, which contain much necessary compromise, set a fair balance between those whose dream of a new Europe was a federal development against those who have a much more modest demand that the 27 countries of the European Union would co-operate to the highest possible degree. The hopes of those who desired to see some type of united states of Europe could not be realised on this occasion. A Europe of nation states, with every country's sovereignty fully protected, is the only way forward for the vast majority. The Convention chairman, Giscard d'Estaing, was very disappointed at what he felt was the slipping away of the federation. His idea was of a cohesive federal Europe with its own President and Foreign Minister, a small Commission and a powerful Parliament. He was certainly entitled to this opinion but it was a step much too far for the majority of European citizens, certainly for the majority of European states.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">Last week's sensible compromises, while they represent a comprehensive victory for Europe's small states, also mark the best way forward. They provide the most attractive welcome to the new states hoping to enter the European Union. I welcome the positive result of the Polish referendum last weekend. However, I do not believe the Polish people who voted overwhelmingly in favour of the European project last weekend would do so if they felt their country was about to become part of a united states of Europe. The Polish people, the peoples of the former Soviet bloc, the Irish and many others look forward to playing a meaningful role within the new structures of Europe but they wish to do so as fully fledged independent countries. I welcome the fact that the new draft treaty makes it very clear the European Union will be a union of states and citizens and that its powers will be conferred on it by the member states. As Giscard d'Estaing said some weeks ago, democratic legitimacy is enshrined in our national parliaments.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The new Europe of up to 27 countries will obviously need management structures which will actually work and administrative structures which are not just citadels of bureaucracy. If the European Union is to be relevant and beneficial to its millions of citizens and, in particular, its citizens in the newly emerging countries, it is fair to say administration will almost be as important as ethos. In that regard, I am very pleased with the progress made last week, particularly in regard to the landmark proposal that each country, whether big or small, will have one Commissioner. This is not just an improvement on the Nice treaty proposals. It will also mean that for the first time since 1973 a country such as Ireland will have the very same Commission representation as the larger states such as Germany, France and Britain. So much for the anti-European sloganeering of those who suggested that we would be taken over by a European ‘big brother'.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The proposed new composition is probably the biggest victory of the small states in the negotiating process. It is a clear indication of how the smaller states of the European Union, working together, can achieve progress. Ireland, including the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, in particular, has played a very major role in this campaign to retain a Commissioner from each country. Our success will ensure Ireland will continue to be the natural leader of the small countries brigade within the Union. This will bring significant positive benefits in a Union where alliances will continue to play a major role in policy-making. It was vital that we kept full Commission representation but it also must be conceded that for the Union to work well, the Commission must have the capacity not just to debate but to also make decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The concept of having an inner core of 15 Commissioners voting at Commission meetings helps achieve this balance. The fact that these 15 Commissioners will be rotated on the basis of strict equality between member states is the only fair and equitable way forward. Each country, big and small, will have a Commissioner for ten out of each 15 years. This is a significant advance on the Nice treaty proposals. Should this most recent compromise be finally agreed, as I hope it will, we can expect some of the larger countries will then press for a major extension of qualified majority voting. We have to be extremely careful of any such proposal. The present concept of a qualified majority – a majority of member states representing at least 60% of the EU population – should not be watered down in any way. I hope the proposal of the so-called super-qualified majority for more sensitive policy areas will be seriously taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">I wish to refer briefly to the question of the proposed permanent president of the European Council. In effect, what now appears to be envisaged is a chairman or co-ordinator, not the powerful "president of Europe" type of figure suggested by some in the earlier debate on this issue. I noted with interest the various proposals on the issue, varying from Deputy John Bruton's idea of a president directly elected by the citizens of Europe to the much more <i>status quo</i> approach of Commissioner Neil Kinnock when he addressed the Joint Committee on European Affairs some weeks ago. I appreciate Deputy Bruton's vision in this regard but, at a time when the clear consensus is that the European Union is a group of individual states working in close harmony, not a united states of Europe, the new proposals for the European Council permanent president or chairman is possibly the best way forward. I was impressed by the argument of Commissioner Kinnock that an elected president supported by a particular political grouping would have to come forward with an almost party-political agenda and one would have to question whether such a person would have the necessary political independence and neutrality that a president or chairman-type figure of the European Council would need.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Apart from the EU presidents, much attention will fall on the EU Foreign Minister whose difficult task will be to shape and articulate a common foreign policy. In an ideal world, there should be a single EU voice on foreign policy matters but this may be a bridge too far. Recently we saw the difficulty in this House, this country and Europe in forging a common European approach to the crisis in Iraq. One remarkable feature was the difference in opinion between newly emerging states of eastern Europe and countries such as France and Germany. There may be cynics – not in this House, of course – who would suggest that the American dollar might have been an influencing factor but this is over-simplistic. We have to appreciate that countries which emerged from the grip of Soviet dictatorship are probably in no rush to take new dictation on what their views of world affairs should be. The EU Foreign Minister will, therefore, have to proceed with caution and I am sure that much compromise and fudge will be necessary to make this role workable. As with the proposed EU president, it is possible to envisage in the years ahead a much more powerful EU Foreign Minister of a Union speaking with one voice on international matters. However, that is a debate for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">The same can be said in relation to the area of defence. There seems to be little change in the current position and no great advance towards a common defence position. The proposals certainly put no pressure on Ireland to abandon its formal status as a country of military neutrality. This is something we will have to address at another time but it cannot be conceded that the current proposals from Brussels are causing any difficulty in relation to our neutrality.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_133">The current proposals from Brussels are causing no difficulty for the official Irish position. The anti-EU brigade which continues to argue that our neutrality – if we wish to remain neutral – is threatened by Brussels is simply wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">I welcome the view emerging from the Convention that the European Parliament will retain its number of seats as agreed in the Nice treaty. The Parliament is not the perfect institution – if there is any perfect institution – but it has democratic legitimacy and accountability. The fact that the current President is an Irish MEP shows the significant role which Ireland and other smaller states can play.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">With the European and local elections just a year away, the Government and indeed all of the political parties must urgently commence a campaign of voter information to maximise the turnout. I recall raising this issue in another House in 1999 after the local elections and being advised by the then Minister that he would look at ways and means of increasing electoral participation. It is not only a European but a world wide problem, but we, as politicians, must concede that it is a reflection on us to some degree that in a local or European election perhaps not more than 40% or 45% of people would wish to exercise their right to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">If we really believe that the European Parliament matters, just as we believe that local government matters, then we, as party politicians, must take whatever step is necessary to increase turnout next June. Whether this will necessitate Sunday voting or a two-day voting block on a Saturday and Sunday such as took place in Poland at the weekend, all of this must be taken on board and must be examined. If we want to make the institutions of Europe relevant, the one on which we can have the most impact is the Parliament. With elections taking place next June, we must try to engage the public to whatever degree possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I again congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and everybody involved in the work of the Convention. This work will now move to the Intergovernmental Conference and the Governments will eventually make the final call, but from this House the message can go out clearly that Ireland is doing well in the Convention negotiations. Of all the countries in Europe, Ireland has possibly done best since its entry in 1973. Europe has transformed us economically and socially. It has made Ireland a truly independent nation. We can look forward to the future where we will continue to play a major role, probably punching significantly beyond our weight on the European stage. I wish the Minister of State and the Government well in their further endeavours in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_59">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_138">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, who has replaced the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, at this debate. I preface my contribution by congratulating Deputy Roche, and other members of the delegation, who worked for us at the Convention over the past 16 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">The purpose of the Convention was to reflect what happened at Nice one, and particularly at Nice two, to see how best we could simplify the new draft constitutional treaty to make it clear and comprehensible and to address that disconnection between the citizen and the European Union. The Convention has done just that. It has brought all the treaties together and compiled one new draft constitutional framework, which will reflect the problems and the concerns out there regarding the future of Europe. I congratulate the Minister of State and his team on their work over the past months in bringing this together and compiling the work of the working groups into one final report.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">The areas highlighted were those which reflected subsidiarity, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, making the treaty more simple and the role of the national parliaments. These were the key areas which were discussed at length and I am glad that we have finalised many of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The area in which there was the greatest triumph, fronted by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, was that of the composition and size of the Commission. It was said that the small states saw off an attempt to cut the size of the Commission and regained the right of each member state to nominate a commissioner. This is an improvement on the bargain struck at Nice and I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, on the huge amount of work done in achieving this. It is now established that up to 2009 every country will have a Commissioner and from 2009 onwards there will be two types of Commissioner, one having voting rights and the other non-voting rights, but they will work on a rotating basis, each qualifying for equal access. This is a marvellous achievement for the Irish delegation. It is important for us that we will be represented at the Commission. It ensures that the Commission will be part and parcel of the Irish citizen. That will ease the unrest which came out strongly in the past couple of months on the issue of where we were in relation to the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I welcome the roll back in the area of taxation. Ireland again took the lead in opposing any move towards tax harmonisation by qualified majority voting. I was delighted to hear yesterday at the Joint Committee on European Affairs that Deputy Ruairí Quinn strongly backed the Minister in arguing that taxation issues should be retained by the member states. It is nice to get a consensus of opinion across our parties on this major important issue. It is a fundamental issue that the relationship of the citizen and the state regarding taxation should remain within the member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Of course there is more to be done and there are modifications in some areas. I note that there is an ongoing discussion regarding Justice and Home Affairs. While great progress has been made, thanks to the contribution of the working group chaired by Deputy John Bruton in the area of immigration and the fight against serious cross-border crime and bio-terrorism, this is an area where we must pool our sovereignty and resources. However, it does not necessarily mean that we should pool all our sovereignty. Where military alliances are concerned, naturally the member state must have its own definition of its power within that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">I also understand that in the area of public health there has been wider co-operation in European states on disease controls. We saw examples of that during the foot and mouth disease outbreak and we should extend such co-operation to the area of contagious human disease. A mechanism to deal with that would be very welcome and I know there is ongoing discussion on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">On the institutions, there seems to be ongoing discussion and unfinished business regarding the definition of the workload, the shape and the brief of the Presidency of the European Council. It is important that no matter what changes or reforms come about within the institution, the balance will be maintained between the various institutions within Europe. That balance should be strengthened. It should not be a case of one overcoming the other or overlapping into the other areas. As the Minister of State said, there is ongoing debate on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">We are at the final stage of this draft constitutional treaty and consensus has been reached on most of the issues. It is important that we redefine the role of national parliaments. I welcome that development which has already taken place the area of EU scrutiny, where the directives emanating from Europe are now being monitored and will be redirected back to Europe with amendments and perhaps a yellow card to show that we are not happy with them. The public at large would welcome that development because this is where it broke down during the Nice referendum, where people felt that a decision was taken from them and there was no sense of being part of Europe. The people felt that the power had disappeared. What has been happening over the past 16 months will certainly reassure the public. When we put forward this constitutional referendum to the people within the next year they will be much happier in dealing with it. Educated citizens want honesty, clarity and a well-argued debate. They will not take what we say for granted. They want to know what is being done. By working through this Convention, we have made that happen. In the next couple of months, when the final stages of the Convention are put to the intergovernmental conference, we will come out with a very favourable treaty which will be understandable, comprehensible and simple, and the public will understand where we are at.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">We will then be in a Union of 27 members. It will be a different type of union. We need to let the public know that the reform had to come and that, whatever the changes which must go with that reform, we will hold our identity. We are a member state and each of the states has a different history, different culture and way of life. We must maintain that difference while working together. The Convention has achieved this aim. The composition and size of the Commission, the reform of the Council of Europe and the Council of Ministers and the achievement of a balance in the institutions are issues to be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">We must explain the workings of these institutions to the citizens and make them feel part of the whole. This House must examine how it can best explain that message. As Members of this House our duty is to explain to the public that we are doing the best we can for Ireland and that our national identity, history and culture will not be sacrificed. We are empowering ourselves and we will pool our resources where necessary. We will work and co-operate but will do so with refinement and simple clarity, as this Convention has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">There are worries about the framework of the Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the right balance must be achieved so that competence is not eroded. We want to be able to maintain our ability to deal with issues such as fundamental rights and yet to give way where necessary when it comes to a question of European law. These are areas of concern that must be reformed and refined over the next days. Hopefully we will have time for reflection before the intergovernmental conference next October when we expect to have a very good treaty to put to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The conclusion of the Convention is a great occasion. It has taken a long time and great commitment from all the members of the Irish Government who have spoken on our behalf at the Convention. It has been a success story and we can feel confident that the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and his team made it work for us. I predict a successful Intergovernmental Conference and possibly a treaty of Dublin in 2004 as a result.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_60">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_151">This is an interesting debate. Over the last months my attitude has changed. I was in agreement with the notion that we needed to update, modify and codify the treaties, that we required a grand step forward and, in the words of Giscard d'Estaing, that we needed a treaty for a generation so that there would not be a need for its constant changing. The argument for that is clear and does not need to be repeated. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that we are being given a consolidation and reformulation in simple language of the Nice treaty. I am very reluctant to be hauled over the coals or to walk on hot coals again for the sake of something which is very little more than a tweaking of the Treaty of Nice.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The second Nice referendum demonstrated that these debates can be won if we offer a bold vision of Europe to the Irish people. If we can offer that, then I am convinced that the Irish people will buy into and support it. If we propose a codification of previous treaties which also involves some tweaking, then I fear for the result and for our capacity to convince in that debate. We need to return to our basic belief.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Even listening to this debate I note a loss of confidence among those of us who were previously quite confident in our support for the European Union and its institutions and the whole project. I listened to the debate which was held yesterday in the House of Commons. The sub-stratum of the debate about EMU is actually a greater debate about membership of the European Union. Perhaps we need Senator White to address us and to sort out the Minister of State – I apologise and withdraw that comment before the Acting Chairman asks me to do so. The undercurrent in the debate in the House of Commons was whether Britain should be part of the European Union or whether it liked the idea – as the treaty re-states – of giving the European Union power to override the House of Commons on certain issues or certain competences, to use the phrase.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">A provision which has been in the treaty since the early 1970s, in the Treaty of Rome and now in the Irish Constitution, effectively states that anything that is part of European competence will automatically override Irish law. This has suddenly become controversial and it is symptomatic of a loss of confidence. Those of us who have always believed in the project are reluctant to make the argument any more. Senator Bradford emphasised phrases such as "fully-fledged independent states" and "loss of sovereignty". Being part of the European Union involves a loss and a pooling of sovereignty. This is essential for the working of the Union. The sharing of sovereignty is decided as a matter of policy in certain areas. I acknowledge that the Government is not saying that we are all entirely independent and that we have a veto over everything. I regret that there has been an element of serious backsliding in what has been this country's long-held position. I am not afraid of the word "federal" and the ever closer Union formulation. I am not particularly afraid of the united states of Europe formulation. I have almost always endorsed the manner in which the European Union has operated its social and environmental policy and the limited extent to which its foreign policy has dealt with issues such as the Middle East. I would like to see QMV extended into other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">To deal specifically with the treaty, in terms of institutional change the compromise about the Commission, if it holds good over the next week, is not a bad one. The notion that each country is treated equally in that all can nominate a Commissioner, whether that is a front line Commissioner or a super junior Commissioner, is a reasonable compromise. The principle that each country is treated equally is clearly important and I am pleased that has been secured.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I am more unsure about the notion of a European foreign minister, largely because I am not sure what it amounts to, if anything at all. Commissioners Solana and Patten are doing what will be done by a European foreign minister. I am in favour if it makes things simpler. The bottom line is that a European foreign minister or two Commissioners is meaningless if there is not some form of consensus as to what European foreign policy should be or at the very least in terms of the treaty, a mechanism whereby one can be agreed. We are a long way from that agreement, as the events of the past ten weeks have illustrated only too clearly. As long as Britain and France insist, they are entitled to an independent say on the most powerful body in the world, the Security Council, without any reference to the European Union. This is a serious problem for the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">Following one of the meetings in Brussels which followed the ending of the hostilities in Iraq, it was put to President Chirac that his view on Iraq would have been defeated if the principle of QMV on common foreign and security policy which he supports had been in place in a European Union of 25 members. He had the good grace to acknowledge the truth of that proposition. He also acknowledged that if the European Union is to have a common foreign policy then countries such as his will have to accept the notion of defeat. That must be the core of the formulation of any process for achieving a common foreign policy much less a foreign policy itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Countries as powerful as France, Germany and the United Kingdom must be willing to accept that occasionally they will find themselves holding a minority opinion and must act accordingly. The treaty imposes a serious moral and legal obligation on individual countries to co-operate with others in terms of foreign policy. That is a good provision and I acknowledge that it cannot be taken any further now. We should explicitly state that we will have to go further, in time, if it is to be meaningful. It is not enough simply to impose, for the moment, a moral obligation which the United Kingdom clearly feels entirely happy to ignore. The reform that will be involved in putting in place a foreign minister will count for nothing if we do not have a policy that means something.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">Article 40, which deals with defence matters, is a problem for my party and me as it is currently formulated. I appreciate that these matters seem to change from day to day, but I understand that the current draft places a treaty obligation on member states to increase spending on armaments, establishes the armaments agency and requires, as a matter of treaty obligation, that there be co-operation between the European Union and NATO. I am in the majority in my party, albeit not a large one, in so far as I am not one of those who shrinks away from the notion of the EU acting in a military fashion. I support the existence of a capacity to deal with Petersberg Tasks, as we need to be able to enforce security in the current territory of the Union, as well as in a broadly defined Europe, which may include the Caucasus, parts of eastern Europe and the Balkans. This capacity is needed so that we can prevent the horror of events such as those in Srebrenica and Gorazde without the say-so of the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">I have always taken this view and I do not have a problem with the fact that it requires a military capacity. We may also be required to co-operate with NATO, on occasion. Most people on the social democratic left, including my party and I, although not the British Labour Party, would like such a capacity to intervene, independent of the White House or the Pentagon, to be developed. Having read Article 40, it seems clear to me that those who want to ensure the European Union acts only in concert with the Pentagon are winning the day. I have grave difficulty with such an approach. We will run into serious trouble when we come to put the Convention to the people if Article 40 is not amended substantially.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">I am almost alone in my party in holding the view that tax harmonisation is not as bad a thing as people seem to think. I am firmly convinced that in a couple of years' time, many of the current applicant states will have corporation tax rates lower than that in Ireland. This process, which has already started, will directly and immediately cause a serious problem in this country. When a workforce that is capable of doing the work that US multinationals currently do here becomes available, such companies will move to the Baltic or elsewhere in eastern Europe. It is in our interest to provide for a minimum level – it does not have to be exactly the same in all member states – of corporation tax throughout the European Union. Such a minimum level may not be any higher than this country's current rate, a situation that would suit us perfectly, but we will have to move in the direction of harmonisation. I do not agree with the blanket refusal to contemplate tax harmonisation as a matter for qualified majority voting.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">I would like to deal with the religious aspect of the treaty. Although it is not central to the treaty, I will comment on it largely to be provocative. I have no real difficulty with the reference in the draft treaty to the recognition of specific churches, as I recognise that they have been significant social forces in Europe for a long time. I would have a difficulty with a preamble, were it to emerge, which reflected the Preamble of the Irish Constitution. Although its tradition is basically Judeo-Christian – the Christian churches are responsible for much of its culture and most of its historical problems – it should be acknowledged that Europe is a diverse place. A large percentage of European people, including citizens of this country, do not adhere to the beliefs of the Christian churches or other churches. A significant percentage of European people adhere to churches that are not Judeo-Christian. There are substantial Muslim minorities in France and Britain. One can try to list these churches and to draw together a formula which acknowledges them and genuflects in their direction, but I think it would be meaningless to do so. I would prefer to see a defined distinction between church and state and a clear statement that this treaty is between states and is intended to govern the secular world rather than anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The treaty contains some interesting monetary union proposals, such as those dealing with economic and social governance. We need to balance these areas. It is all very well to talk in terms of the broad economic policy guidelines which are produced every year by ECOFIN, but a counter-balance in social policy is needed. This issue has waxed and waned over the years – sometimes it is there and sometimes it is not – and tends to depend on the political colour of the national Governments in the Union at any given time. I gather that an intervention in the area of social policy has considerable support in the Convention, particularly in the PES. If we can define a right for the free movement of capital, we should also be able to state that workers have certain treaty rights. If one goes one way, one also has to go the other way – it is as simple as that. There needs to be a balance in terms of social rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">I agree with many of Senator Ormonde's common sense remarks about justice and home affairs. Crime is an increasingly cross-border phenomenon. There are difficulties as a result of crime which originates outside the borders of the European Union, for example from the Middle East or from the Russian mafia. It is clearly in our interest to combat this issue, but it is difficult to do so when there are such entirely disparate criminal justice systems without a common system of enforcement or prosecution. I acknowledge that we have to ensure the rights of accused people are observed, an issue on which the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, has been strong. I do not support the position that obtains in a few European countries, where somebody can be detained and charged or not charged a year later, depending on what has been discovered in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">I support the notion of harmonising policy in a defined range of areas such as cross-border crime, in relation to the sort of criminal offences as a result of which people are prosecuted and in relation to the way in which people are prosecuted. This can be done by developing a joint prosecution service. This is a good thing and we should not be nervous about it. We need to develop the joint arrest warrant and the mutual recognition of arrest warrants and I appreciate that progress is being made in that regard. Equally, individual traditions, such as Ireland's common law past, should be recognised and acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">I will summarise by saying that we need some <i>courage, mes amis</i>. We do not need simply to tweak what has gone before, as if we do we will lose when we present it to the Irish people. The second referendum on the Nice treaty was won when people who believe in the European project and in ever-closer union, who were willing to define what such ideas mean to Irish people, took their arguments to the people. We will win a further referendum if we take a similar approach. We are destined to lose, however, if we falter or slide backwards by trying to qualify every move forward with half a dozen defences which look backwards. The latter approach is not worth a candle.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_61">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_167">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House this afternoon. I find myself in broad agreement with the remarks that have been made by Senator McDowell.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Greater philosophical questions need to be considered when we talk about the Convention on the Future of Europe and examine its detail. Such questions, which are coming more to the fore, relate to the nature of federalism and the Union, or the degree to which sovereignty should be pooled and maintained. These issues were submerged for a long time during the European debate, which centred on the detail of the institutional apparatus and framework. The use of such jargon can make the European debate impenetrable to the public. We are beginning to engage with people on the important philosophical questions within which the debate takes place. The work of Senator Maurice Hayes in the Forum for Europe, which has attempted to engage people throughout the country, is to be applauded in that context. The European movement has also done some valuable work in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">We have come a long way – much further than I expected – in relation to the Convention on the Future of Europe. The Minister of State mentioned this progress in his opening remarks. I expressed serious reservations about the ability of the Convention to produce a report before the Thessaloniki Council. I thought it would not be possible and that the process would drag on into the autumn. It was possible that the Dublin Intergovernmental Conference might have to begin to discuss the issue, rather than finalising the debate on the matter and producing a treaty of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The Convention has gone a long way towards minimising the extent to which the Intergovernmental Conference might attempt to unpick what has been included in the report. It would be unhelpful for it to do so. While it may be surprising that this is the case, a broad consensus has emerged. That is not to say that it should not have a view or that people should not promote their particular national interests. We are approaching a point where there is a genuine synthesis. In that respect, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and his officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs are to be applauded, together with Deputy John Bruton, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, and the alternates, Deputy Carey and Mr. Bobby McDonagh. They have done a remarkable job, not just for the country but also for the smaller states within the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The degree to which a coalition has been fashioned from the smaller states is something that is, perhaps, at the essence of the Union. Many of us tried to promote this as one of the strengths of the Union in successive referendum debates. The capacity of a range of countries to come together to form a common view and to have that view sustained has been amply demonstrated. The message was always there, but it is now more evident that it is possible through networking and finding common interests with other groups within the Union to have those interests promoted and sustained. That is a significant and important aspect of what is emerging from the Convention. Despite everything that was said in the past, the small states have shown the ability to have their points of view at least listened to and, in many instances, to have their ideas incorporated. This trend is likely to be reinforced when the Union is enlarged. Those coalitions can be extended and they can shift one way or the other over time, which is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">The issue of federalism is at the heart of this debate. It was a cause of some anxiety at the start due to the presumption that Giscard d'Estaing would try to develop a federalist model. At the core of the problem is what exactly is meant by federalism, a point Senator McDowell made quite forcefully and well. What do we mean by sovereignty? We have to acknowledge that the Union is federalist in its nature. It is federalist in many things that it does. It has shared competences and there are federalist aspects to how it operates. However, it is not a federation in the same way as Germany or the United States. While it has federal characteristics, it is not a federalist state. I would not like it to become such a state and I do not believe it will.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">I accept that we have pooled our sovereignty, but we have done so to our great benefit. Society has been utterly transformed and the country has become a better place. An economic boom might have taken place had we remained outside of Union, but I suspect that this would not have been the case. It is by pooling sovereignty that we have gained some of our strengths and achieved considerable social and economic progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">People who have been opposed to every treaty and who have always been on the "No" side of every referendum put forward the proposition that the Constitution will be more or less swept aside to be superseded by an over-arching European superstate. This will not be the case. The Union will only be responsible for the areas in which it has competence. The Constitution is supreme and will remain so. It is quite wrong to suggest that the Constitution will, in some way, become subservient to Europe. Irish law will certainly be adjusted as a result of our membership of the EU. That has always been the case and it will continue to be – in my view, beneficially so.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">This brings me to one of the key issues raised by Senator McDowell, namely, our vision for the future. What is the vision of the Union as it emerges and what is our vision of our role within it? The Nice treaty was the first occasion on which the achievement of Spaak, Adenauer, Schuman and others was recognised. After a war that tore the whole of Europe apart, they were determined that it would never happen again. They created the European Coal and Steel Community, out of which grew first the Common Market and latterly the European Union. That is their achievement. During the past 500 years, there are not many instances of when a period of 50 years passed without a major conflict. It could be argued, however, that we have had a major conflict, namely, that which occurred in the Balkans, which are on the European mainland.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">This leads us to the issue of defence and a common foreign and security policy. It was wrong of the Union to be in a position where it more or less had to stand back in the face of genocide. It was not able to intervene on its own doorstep and had to rely on a NATO-led force to come in and do the business for it. When that was done, the Union tried to claim some credit. That is how it appeared to me. Important issues have to be decided which may not be within the confines of the Convention and what it has to say on defence. There are some ambiguities that I find difficult to understand. On one hand, it seems to be saying that we are heading towards a common defence while, on the other, it appears to be saying that we are not. We have to confront this issue. Is the Union prepared to stand back in the face of genocide and despotism and not have something to say? More particularly, will it stand back when one member state is subject to attack? It is incorporated that there should be solidarity in regard to terrorism within member states. The other states will come to the aid of the one that is threatened, which is as it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">We cannot just pick the parts that suit us – as we have done in the past – and then decide that the things we do not particularly like are not for us. If that were the case, the compromises contained in the document would never have appeared. There has to be some trade-off. There are fundamental principles at stake and people have to adhere to them. I am not saying that a state should compromise its fundamental position, but one has to be prepared to engage in the debate. It has not always been evident to me that we have been prepared to engage in the debate to the extent that is required. There was a bowing towards the Pentagon and an acceptance that if the Americans decided to take action, we would tag along. I do not regard that as desirable.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I take the point that adjustments may need to be made in regard to the Treaty of Nice. However, in terms of the referendum that would be required for us to adopt the new treaty, it would be totally unhelpful to unpick that treaty because it could lead to serious problems with regard to the adoption of the final draft. It is important that the treaties be simplified. Those of us who were involved in the discussions on the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties got weary with the cross-referencing to sections of earlier treaties. It reached the point where we were referring to three or four pieces of paper to find out what was being said. This matter is important from the point of view of being open. In order to connect with the population of the Union, it is important that these things are simplified and that people can actually read them.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">It always surprises me that British legislation of the 19th century is a model of clarity and includes clear and simple language. However, we have got to such a sophisticated stage in society that we have to introduce qualifying terms such as "in relation to" and "with regard to", to the extent that documents become almost unreadable. While that may be an oversimplification, there has to be some simplification of the treaties so that one does not have to be an expert in European law in order to tread through the legal labyrinth involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The Convention has made good proposals on the role of national parliaments and there is a role for the Seanad in that regard. The Joint Committee on European Affairs has increased its scrutiny of European legislation through a sub-committee and that is to be welcomed. From the subsidiarity viewpoint, it is important for us to be able to flag any difficulties that may arise so that we can return to the European Court subsequently to indicate that subsidiarity warnings were ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">As already stated, there is a role in this for the Seanad and perhaps it is something that could be considered by the sub-committee dealing with reform in order to subject European issues to proper scrutiny and debate. In recent months we have done that by welcoming members of the Convention on the Future of Europe to come before the House and hearing what they have to say. They, in turn, have had the benefit of listening to what we had to say to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">While the Convention has not finalised its work, our representatives on it have done a good job. The institutional question with regard to the Commission has been resolved well, although I still have some difficulties concerning the balance between the Council and the Commission. There is a power struggle going on and I hope the Commission wins it at the expense of the Council. I would not like to see the Council being given too many powers. The role of the European Parliament within that mix is obviously crucial. We look forward to the emergence of the final report and, as Senator Ormonde stated, we shall hopefully, in the fullness of time, have a treaty of Dublin to which all member states can subscribe.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_62">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_183">The deliberations that have taken place at the Convention on the Future of Europe will see the most profound constitutional transformation of the Union since its inception. The Convention process has moved rapidly since it was inaugurated in February 2002. Many people have been surprised by the fact that its work has moved on so fast in dealing with such a complex issue. It shows the determination and commitment of the nations within Europe to shape and positive, cohesive and constructive future for an enlarged Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">It was imperative for Ireland to take a positive role and a proactive stance in the constitutional treaty and to embrace the challenge with great vigour and purpose. I wish to compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, on his role in the process. We should also compliment the civil servants at the Department of Foreign Affairs and we should be proud of all the Irish people who fought Ireland's case throughout the Convention negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">It is essential for the public to be continually informed about the process. I am convinced that more knowledge of Europe leads to more support for Europe. The nature of the Union will change, quantitatively and qualitatively, after enlargement in 2004. Constitutional, institutional and external action arrangements are necessary to ensure a cohesive and operational Union. The principal questions for Irish citizens and for ourselves, as legislators, centre around the type of future European Union we need to meet the challenges of a modern, diverse, complex and changing world, the kind of treaty the EU requires and Ireland's interests in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The identification of the values and objectives of the Union is of critical importance to the success of the treaty in addressing citizens' concerns. These values include: the assertion that fundamental human rights transcend national sovereignty; the creation of a peace zone extending to central and eastern Europe; a commitment to global ecology; and the use of development co-operation as a means of reversing colonial exploitation. The implementation of these values would contribute significantly to a better Europe. Many of these points were encompassed in an amendment to Article 3.4, which was proposed during the negotiations by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Defence and foreign and security policy will play a major part in any referendum on the Convention. The role of Irish peacekeepers has been recognised worldwide. We should be involved actively in European defence and security issues, as well as playing a full role as an equal partner, on this as on many other issues, that concern a united Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">We should at all times support the primacy of the United Nations in resolving international disputes. We should not be afraid to speak out and stand up to any nation, whether within or outside the EU, that might favour aggression rather than peace and reconciliation in resolving such disputes. In the areas of freedom, security and justice, the combating of cross-border crime – or crime directed against the common policy of the Union – should form an integral part of the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The proposals before the Convention were modest, carefully considered and called for due regard for the different legal traditions of member states. However, they respond to the need for more effective decision-making structures and procedures and for greater transparency and democratic and judicial control of legislation once adopted. We must have co-operation between the courts and security systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The issue of tax harmonisation has been left out of the negotiations and it will be a matter for individual member states. That decision was of paramount importance for this country. The position taken regarding our commissioner is certainly an advance on that of the Nice treaty. The prophets of doom who predicted that we would lose our commissioner have been put firmly in their place.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The Convention covers every aspect of an enlarged Union and will generate lively debate in all member states in the period leading up to the Irish Presidency in January 2004. I have been a member of the Committee of the Regions in Europe for the past five years and we have had some very fruitful discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, as well as with Senator Maurice Hayes – in his role as chairman of the Forum on Europe – and Deputy John Bruton. We pointed out that it was of paramount importance that the principle of subsidiarity should be strongly defended and this has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">I appeal to the Minister of State to brief people regularly in the weeks and months ahead in a coherent and positive manner – and in plain English – on the main contents of the Convention. This will ensure that the electorate is fully <i>au fait</i> with the provisions of the Convention before being asked to vote on the treaty in a referendum. As I said earlier, more knowledge of Europe leads to more support for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the work of the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, in the Convention process. This has been acknowledged by all Members, including the Minister of State. I pay tribute to him and to the other Irish members involved in the negotiations because they did Ireland proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">As Senator Dardis said, the Seanad should be more actively involved in European affairs. This issue should be discussed during the debate on the reform of the Seanad. Members spoke on the Order of Business about stress. Given the number of sitting days in the year, we certainly will not be stressed in either the Dáil or Seanad. This matter should be addressed. I do not believe the public are aware of the time we spend here. We should devote more attention to debating issues such as Europe. This should be included in Seanad reform. We also need Oireachtas reform in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">We have gone a long way on the Convention in a relatively short time. There is still a lot of mileage left in these matters at intergovernmental conference level and debates within member states. On the whole it is a good and balanced draft document which deserves support.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMauriceHayes" eId="spk_63">
          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_196">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I welcome also the earlier statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">We should recognise the Convention for what it is. It has been an amazingly innovative way to try to sort out the problems of organising the business in Europe. We have all suffered and complained in the past about work being done in smoke-filled rooms during unsocial hours at night and so on. For the first time, Europe has tried the bold experiment of sharing it thoughts and having an open debate which was open to intervention from people via the Internet. This involved people from the national parliaments, the European Parliament and various interest groups. It is something of a coup that M. Giscard d'Estaing was able to preside over it and carry it off, and we should not minimise the extent of the achievement. As many Members here remarked, we would not have believed three or four months ago that they would have reached this degree of consensus on major issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">I join in thanking and congratulating those Irish people involved either as representatives of the Oireachtas, Government or whatever. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, Deputy John Bruton, Mr. De Rossa and their alternates have done a remarkable job. However, we should recognise over and above that the job done by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche. He was described by Deputy John Bruton in one of the European journals as the shopsteward of the smaller countries, which is an important role to have played. It has made it a better draft agreement than it otherwise might have been. It is important to recognise him not for having necessarily defended Irish special interests but for having improved the draft for all the countries of Europe, particularly for smaller countries. It would have unnecessarily limited the generosity of spirit with which they approached this task if they were activated only by our own self-interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">This brings me to another point which echoes the point made by Senator McDowell regarding how this message is conveyed to the Irish people and more generally. Perhaps there is a temptation to present these things as being merely minimalist, saying that we should not worry too much because it will not be that different from before. What is in train is something much grander. It reminds me a bit of the mistake the Unionist leadership made in relation to the Good Friday Agreement. This was a considerable achievement but, by and large, they went round apologising for it, saying not to worry because it could have been worse. If we approach the matter in this way, the Irish people might find it more difficult to embrace it. The end point of all this should be our consideration of how it will be presented to the Irish people. It should be presented in a way which engages their interest and enthusiasm, so that they see it as a noble adventure, one which is in the interest of the country and Europe as a whole and in which they would want to be engaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">We must think in terms of maintaining this debate and not necessarily closing it down. If issues remain at the end of the Convention which must eventually be sorted out in an Intergovernmental Conference, one would hope the Intergovernmental Conference would embrace the same spirit of openness and transparency and that the leaders would not simply retreat behind closed doors again and come out with a fudged document. Now that the debate has been started, it should be kept going in as open a way as possible. The Irish position might well be reserved on some of the issues yet to come and the fine tuning that will take place, particularly in relation to balance. There is a lot to be said for not unduly unravelling the settlement arrived at in Nice in terms of presentation to the people and otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">They seem to have begun to arrive at an interesting position in relation to the representative nature of the Commissioners. It appears that each country will have a Commissioner, 15 of them at any time will have a vote and countries will have the same chance as other countries of being in that rotation. This is a case where even nomenclature will be important. It is important to recognise that the basic status is commissioner, and everyone has that, but some commissioners for some periods have the enhanced responsibility of carrying a vote with them. I would rather see them as "commissioners plus" rather than have 15 Commissioners and all the rest "Commissioners minus", described as assistants, alternates or whatever. In terms of public support and understanding, the basic thing should be the Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">It would be sensible to move on to some sort of common policy in relation to the prosecution of cross-border crimes. I do not think we should be frightened about that. There are real difficulties between the code system and the common law system. There are horror tales we can all tell about prosecutorial or investigatorial systems where people can be locked up for quite some time merely on suspicion. If it is narrowly defined, and one is dealing with serious crimes of a terrorist nature or drug-related crimes or serious theft or whatever it might be, and such crimes cross borders, it should be possible to deal with that. We should not be frightened to tackle it.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Though the full text is not available, and I am not sure what form the incorporation of the charter of fundamental rights takes, I have one small reservation. As I understand it, there are horizontal provisions there which relate the operation of the charter to the agencies and instruments of the EU rather than to what is done domestically. I was rather shaken by the last clause, clause 54, which purports to say that none of these rights can be used to question the rights that are already there, or to secure any limitation of those rights. I know what is meant, but it is a long way from the language of the first amendment to the American Constitution. This is one of those cases where I would rather be closer to Philadelphia, so to speak, than to Berlin. The Minister of State might look at the impact of that and consider whether or not there is a danger of a truncation of the right to free speech enshrined in our own Constitution. I know why the clause I refer to is in the document, but robust democracy should be strong enough to take robust criticism.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">On the broader front, I commend what our representatives have done on our behalf and I wish them well. The Government, and all of us, have a responsibility to ensure the debate is carried as widely as possible to the people of Ireland, and that there is the widest degree of understanding of the issues. We should also use the time and the instruments, including this Chamber, in order to do that. It is important to keep the momentum going, to ensure that – unlike what happened in the past – when the Irish people are asked to make a decision on this issue, it is an informed decision based on a good debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I want to congratulate all those who have been involved in the negotiations. They have been conducted on behalf not only of Ireland but of Europe. This is a particularly attractive aspect of the way the negotiators have gone about things.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I regretted very much the fact that – as I said at the Forum on Europe – all the Irish politicians who went out to negotiate were men. I would not like the people of Europe to think that Irish women were not interested in the future of Europe. Person for person, Irish women have gained more from membership of the EU than Irish men, particularly with regard to social policy. I hope that a splendid number of the officials who went out from the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the other Government Departments, were women. No doubt the Minister of State made sure of that, so that the balance was redressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">I congratulate Senator Maurice Hayes on his chairing of the Forum on Europe. I had the privilege of attending many of the sessions, both in Dublin Castle and around the country, and they were very good experiences. Senator Ormonde and others made the point that we will have to explain the treaty of Dublin to the general public so that, as Senator McDowell so colourfully put it, we will not again be running across hot coals in our efforts to get the treaty accepted by the people. It is terribly important. None of the political parties went far enough in trying to explain the Nice treaty initially, but we made a very good effort the second time around. There is no good reason why we can not do as well on the next occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">We need to take a special interest in the new countries joining the European Union. I say that as someone who has been a member of several inter-parliamentary groups which contain members of the European family from outside the European Union. The countries which have been accepted are very excited about access to the European Union, and those still waiting for acceptance are doing their very best to comply with the rules of the club, so that they will not have to wait too much longer. It is a privilege as well as a responsibility to try to bring those countries forward as democratic states. I hope that we in this country, both officially within the European Union and in other bodies outside Europe but connected with it, will try to promote democracy in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Once again I raise the issue of women in Europe. I have been travelling to Slovakia for some years and it has been really well worthwhile. Women's groups there managed to promote cross-border co-operation and conversation in an extraordinarily successful fashion. I would encourage anyone involved in organisations in other countries to reciprocate by expressing the views they have in order to become involved in what is going on in these countries. It is worthwhile to give a little guidance at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I am always fascinated by people who seem to think we will lose some of our identity or our cultural past. I have far too much confidence in our own identity to think that anything like that could happen. Some years ago, the French newspaper <i>Ouest France</i> organised a competition for schoolchildren based on choosing a motto for Europe. A tremendous number of entries came in, many from Ireland. I was nominated by <i>The Irish Times</i> as the Irish judge. We had a splendid time judging the mottoes, and we finally settled on “Unity in Diversity”. No one expects us all to be the same. That is foolish. We are all different, but we can be united on a great many subjects, such as those we have spoken of today, and it good to get many different points of view from the Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The euro, which I like tremendously. is now the currency of many European countries. Very clever thinking went into promoting that currency. All the notes are the same, but the coins of each country are different. A noticeable aspect is that though we all go about with pocketfuls of coins, and change them in different countries, the coins minted in each country are still the predominant ones there by a very long chalk. I am quite sure it will continue like that. The identity of the country is absolutely secure for each of us. There is a great deal we can do. It will be like taking a deep breath and going forward into a new version of the European Union. I welcome that very much.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DonLydon" eId="spk_67">
          <from>Mr. Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_214">I congratulate the team we sent to the Convention on the Future of Europe. Deputy Roche has proved to be a superb Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs. He has done a wonderful job. So too have Proinsias De Rossa and Deputy John Bruton, both of whom I listened to with great interest when they spoke in this House. When finalised, this document should be read by every Irish person. It will have profound effects on many areas of our endeavours.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Senator McDowell referred to it as little more than a tweaking. It is more than that. Though not complete, the draft is, as the Minister of State said, simpler than previous treaties. Its structure is clear and comprehensible. Those who have tried to read the treaties of Amsterdam, Maastricht or indeed Nice will understand that we have to simplify these things and make them more comprehensible. The Minister of State noted too that the Convention worked hard to address the disconnection between the European Union and its citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Europe is moving slowly and inexorably towards a large federalist union. I am not afraid of that. I do not care if it is called a federalist union or the United States of Europe or the European Union. The great power and richness of this organisation will be its diversity, because there are so many languages, people, creeds and beliefs and so on. Speaking of languages, this is something that will have to be tackled eventually. We cannot have 25 different languages, but instead should designate one or two. I am sure English will win out in the end, but that is for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">We have a Common Agriculture Policy and an Internal Market Policy, but eventually we will have to have a common security and defence policy. We cannot have a common foreign policy without a defence policy. We should not be afraid to accept our role in the defence of Europe. As Senator Dardis stated, we should not be afraid of joining with the other members of the European Union to prevent genocide or such disasters occurring elsewhere. This is something we can work on and move towards.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Senator McDowell stated that he did not see any change occurring on this matter until France and the UK were no longer members of the UN Security Council. However if the Security Council was just invented, where would we get the members from? We would have one from the Russian Federation, one from China and one from the US, while Europe would have two. That is not a bad deal and we can work with that. Membership of the Security Council should not be a difficulty. Both countries can still work within a common defence policy and be members of the Security Council, giving advice at that level.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I agree with the Senator on tax harmonisation in that it suits Ireland at the moment but as soon as eastern European countries come into the Union, perhaps we may be caught out. Being politicians, we have to go with what is best for us at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Giscard d'Estaing's problem is that he wanted too much too quickly. I am not sure this will be the final constitution for Europe but we have to debate it properly and ensure it is as good as possible. We will lose some of our sovereignty in a large amalgamation of states into the Union, but we will also gain from it. It is a wonderful experiment that has worked so far. As enlargement continues, it will continue to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">As Senator McDowell said, there is no mention of God in the draft constitution. Why not? Deputy John Bruton tried to insert it. Why are we so afraid to mention God? The current preamble which is credited to Valéry Giscard d'Estaing refers to:</p>
          <p eId="para_222">. the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe, which [was], nourished first by the civilisations of Greece and Rome . and later by the philosophical currents of the Enlightenment, .</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Mr. Josep Miró i Ardèvol, president of the Convention of Christians for Europe, has recently stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_224">It borders on the ridiculous that the preamble should make reference to the Hellenistic and Roman component of Europe's heritage and jump directly to the philosophers of the Enlightenment, omitting the Christian reference without which the Enlightenment is incomprehensible. .</p>
          <p eId="para_225">To ignore, as the text does, the reality of European identity, which has Christianity as one of its basic components, constitutes an ideological imposition and expresses the political will that exclusive laicism constitute the sole cultural category and possible reference, thus marginalising the religious factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">It is, as somebody else said, important that between church and state – whatever church, whatever state – that there are clear cut bonds –"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's". I do not see any difficulty in including the word "God" in the preamble. Even non-religioius people can have a belief in a power greater than themselves, an Almighty. However, it may or may not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">This constitution for Europe is a wonderful experiment and development. Incorporated into it is the Convention on Human Rights with all its rights, the right to life, human dignity and so on. We need to grasp it and work with it. It will be much easier to sell to people than any of the previous treaties.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_68">
          <from>Mr. MacSharry</from>
          <p eId="para_228">I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House – the third Minister today in this debate. I note the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, has to leave to continue his excellent work. I congratulate him and all the Irish team at the Convention on their superb representation at such a critical time in the history of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The Union today is a model of political and economic co-operation, unprecedented in world history. Come 2004, the EU will be four times the size of its original membership, which is an overwhelming testament to its appeal to outside countries, ensuring its role as a key player in the world economy. It must be recognised that membership of this successful Union has been without doubt a fundamental element in Ireland's prosperity over the last number of years. Having successfully integrated our economy, our currency and many other aspects of our lives with our European partners, the Ireland of today is now a glowing example of how a small, formerly underdeveloped, peripheral nation can flourish within a Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">It is clear that the Union has not been a static institution, but rather one that has consistently changed over time. It is one that acquires and requires new policies and strategies with each changing reality, even if sometimes at the cost of clarity. The Union has changed enormously and we need to account for these changes. The Single Market, the single currency, successive enlargements and the deepening of EU activity in areas such as justice, home affairs and common foreign and security policy have had a radical effect on how the EU works.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Current negotiations have been fuelled purely by the success of the process of European integration. Expanding the Union from 15 to 25 member states, with the prospect of further expansion, raises not only the question of how best an enlarged Union can be made to work, but also what it should do. For these reasons, we now have no choice but to address these big questions that previous Intergovernmental Conferences sought to avoid.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The Convention on the Future of Europe was specifically established with this aim in mind and represents a new departure for the Union. It has been unique in its tasks, its composition and the way in which it has worked. By bringing together politicians from Governments and parliaments from all 28 current and candidate member states, asking them to take a fresh look at how the EU works without requiring unanimity, it has proved itself an effective agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">It is interesting to note that in many ways the Convention has been an excellent demonstration of the Community method. It has provided a more effective, transparent and structured mechanism for dealing with issues than a traditional Intergovernmental Conference. Discussions at the Convention have been open and the participatory base much wider than before. It is for these reason that the Convention has made valuable strides in policy areas where indecision and ambiguity have always existed.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">The revised overall draft of an EU constitutional treaty published at the end of May is representative of this work and marks an important step forward for the Convention and the Union as a whole. Though much of the text is reprinted from existing clauses in various treaties, many of the articles are intended to be modernising and reforming. This draft constitution contains many welcome changes. Most importantly, this constitutional draft, together with other work of the Convention, has been effective at dealing with challenges facing the Union going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The challenges facing the Union today are based on three guiding principles – simplification, efficiency and democracy. Simplification is about decision-making procedures and institutions. I welcome all those suggestions that simplify the current treaty structure and rationalise the Union's saturated decision-making procedures. It is clear we need a more obvious division of tasks between institutions. We need to simplify and clarify the legislative function whereby the Commission proposes, the Parliament assists and advises and the Council ultimately decides. The proposed Constitution is a valuable step in the right direction in that it will help citizens to determine more clearly those areas for which each institution and authority, including national parliaments, are responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Achieving efficiency in the Union is about making improvements to the functioning of the institutions, particularly in the face of the challenge of enlargement. The decision-making process must be made simpler and speedier. The EU is soon to have a membership of 25 states. If we do not succeed in making a success of radical institutional reform the Union will run into a decision-making crisis. This includes an extension of qualified majority voting by the Council in its decision-making process.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Ireland has always supported the extension of qualified majority voting to areas where it can help increase the effectiveness of decision-making. We should continue to support this method. Clearly, there are also a limited number of red line areas where unanimity must continue to apply if the discussion of the Union are to have legitimacy with its citizens. Amendments to the treaties, taxation and of course decisions on defence are examples of areas where unanimity must be categorically maintained. Ireland has been particularly vocal on this area at the Convention and the hard work has paid off. Although defence remains a sensitive issue, there has been an obvious roll-back in the draft constitution on taxation. This is to be greatly welcomed and a testament to the wonderful efforts of the Minister of State and his team.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Ongoing negotiations on future treaty changes should be about increasing democracy within the European Union. These negotiations should be about reconnecting the people to the process and, as it is often termed, bringing the Union closer to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The European Union has made significant strides and changes in every policy area over the past 50 years. However, while the benefits of these changes have had a direct impact on citizens across the Union, there has been a stubborn tendency for the project of European integration to be seen as rather technocratic, distant from the people. The political project for Europe has reached a point where EU citizens have to take political and, some would say, even emotional ownership of what we are about.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">In addition to increased debate, which the Convention has provoked, it is essential that the public begins to understand what the European Union is doing and why. With this in mind, it is highly desirable for the Union's exercises to be presented in a clearer, more coherent and, ultimately, more attractive way. This is the reason the draft constitution should be seen as a positive step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Bringing the European Union closer to the peoples of Europe is fundamentally about making the system more accountable to those which it governs. Put simply, what we need is a more transparent and democratically accountable system with all institutions held fully to account by the European Parliament and national parliaments. There should be increased Dáil scrutiny of EU legislation and actions. In this regard the Seanad can play a vital role.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Although the Minister of State has laid down a valid argument for a long-term elected president of the Council, I can also recognise merits in having an elected President of the European Commission by an electoral college of members of both national assemblies and the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Although I am aware it is a sensitive issue, now is the time for the European Union to consider signing up to the Convention on Human Rights as an institution. With the Charter of Fundamental Rights, this step would finally legally consolidate the fundamental rights accorded to each EU citizen in the treaties. Every enlargement, new initiative, change and new departure in the Union's history has required a measure of boldness and ambition. By embracing challenge and opportunity together we enabled ourselves to build success upon success and truly have achieved great advances for the peoples of Europe. This time it is no different.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I congratulate our team, including the Minister of State, Deputy John Bruton, Prionsias De Rossa, MEP, and others on their wonderful input and commitment to this process over the past year or so. I wish them, particularly the Minister of State, and those who will participate in the Intergovernmental Conference well over the coming year.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_71">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_247">I want to take up a theme referred to by Senator MacSharry among many others. There is no doubt that political consensus on Europe among the major parties has been beneficial in getting a clear idea about what we want from the negotiations, be they at Intergovernmental Conference level or latterly at the Convention, and in ensuring there is a coherent message from the major parties when it comes to trying to sell it in a referendum. We should not underestimate the political consensus that has been achieved when one compares the debate that took place in Britain yesterday where the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Labour Party and the Tory Party were at loggerheads on this issue. We had a debate on the single currency ten years ago. The British are ten years behind in having any agreement on a single currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The political consensus on Europe has been good but there is a downside. As we saw in the campaign on the first referendum on the Nice treaty, if we take these matters for granted and stop political discourse on the European Union, more and more people will become distanced from it. We must find a way of engaging with the arguments, probably in a party political way, otherwise we will face the dilemma that as long as the main parties seek a consensus on this issue, more and more people will be disengaged from the process and the discussions will be left to more extreme elements on the left and right. While the political maturity we, as a country, have established over the past 30 odd years in coming to a consensus on Europe is beneficial, there are downsides, on which we need to reflect.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I was in Brussels two weeks ago at a meeting of my European political party, the Christian Democrats, at which all of the member states and applicant countries were represented and we heard a pessimistic view of the Convention in terms of where matters were at. However, there has been a difference in two weeks – two weeks is a long time in politics. The difference is that Valéry Giscard d'Estaing has started to listen to people. He did not listen for the past six months but in the past month or so he has begun to do so, largely because of the way in which the Convention is structured. This is the first time we have had a procedure whereby discussions on the future of Europe are in public – the Intergovernmental Conference consists of private discussions. Representatives of this Parliament have been involved in the process as have representatives of the main political families in Europe, the Social Democrats, Liberals, Christian Democrats and other parties. That composition has been crucial in ensuring people like Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and the Establishment of Europe listened to what those of us in politics were trying to say. I came out of that meeting two weeks ago in Brussels pessimistic but I am much more optimistic today when I note the draft compromises made in the past two weeks. It has been a good move.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Two arguments predominate. One, which I have heard mentioned for quite some time, is that in moving rapidly, as we will over the next five to six years, to a Union of 25 member states, we will need to consolidate the changes made and bed them down and that we do not need to move forward as fast. The other argument has been made by federalists. They argue that Europe must continue to integrate. It must quicken the pace of integration and, in a sense, create a federal Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">These two arguments are not in conflict because it is largely assumed that we want to establish, what is referred to as, a United States of Europe or some other structure. What has been established in Europe is unique. It is a European structure of governance and democracy. We take for granted too often the unbelievable architecture put in place in the European Union and Community over the past 20 years. We also take for granted the fact that subsidiarity is a fundamental pillar of the institutions that must never be lost. We take for granted that, if the Convention proposal on the Commission is accepted by the Intergovernmental Conference, small countries like Ireland will have the same rights to nominate a Commissioner as a country of 70 million people such as Germany or a country of 50 million such a Britain. That is an amazing political structure that has been conceded in the talks.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">We also have interdependency in the European Union, the greatest quality in reducing narrow nationalism between the British and the Irish, the French and the Germans, the Catalans and the Spanish and the Flemish and the Walloons. All these regional ethnic conflicts within Europe that dominated so much of the First World War and the preceding centuries have been reduced by the notion of interdependency – the notion that one cannot attack another because if one does, one is attacking one's own people.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Western Europe is the most civilised place in the world to live. It has the lowest rates of incarceration of any prison system in the world and has the highest rates of economic transfers by way of social welfare benefit and health systems. More personal freedoms are to be enjoyed in western Europe than in any other place in the world but we take all these developments for granted. What we have established in Europe over the past 15 to 20 years is unique. One cannot possibly suggest that an enlarged Union will be a mirror of the United States of America or another area of political control. We should take pride in that. The two arguments I presented are not mutually exclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The acceptance by the Convention that the number of Commissioners will continue at 25 and will come into being once 25 countries enter the newly enlarged Union is important. Senator Maurice Hayes referred to the notion from Orwell that all animals are equal but some are more equal than others. The same principle need not apply when it comes to the Commission because, while 15 Commissioners will be at the centre as a type of management core, there will be 25 Commissioners. Every country will have the right to be represented on the inside and outside tracks of the Commission at different times. It is amazing to have achieved that level of agreement and it should not be underestimated.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">It is important that the Council has a greater degree of control when the Union is enlarged to 25 members. I have never supported the notion of a permanent president but we need some form of management, be it at secretary general or presidential level, whose powers can be clearly seen and transparent. The fact that we have accepted in the Convention the number of seats in the European Parliament is important as well because it ensures a small country like Ireland will continue to have a greater percentage of representation in the European Parliament than larger countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The common foreign and security policy is a theme that has emerged in the debate. My party believes that this is an area Ireland needs to discuss in detail before coming to a final conclusion. Europe must have a common foreign and security policy which works, is to the benefit of all European citizens and will counter the reality that the only international policeman in the world is the United States of America. As I said in another place over the weekend, the great shame of Europe is Yugoslavia and what took place in the Balkans. Of the first SFOR troops sent to separate the warring parties in Yugoslavia, 90% were Americans. It was a disgrace that what happened in the Balkans should have occurred within Europe and so close to the borders of the EU. We in Ireland have a duty to debate fully the issue of a common foreign and security policy in the context of the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference. Europe needs a foreign policy to which its members can sign up.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">I have said in another place that the Irish left, which has traditionally opposed the establishment of a common foreign and security policy, needs to realise that, had a common European position emerged on the recent Iraqi war, it would have been that of the French and Germans, not that of the British and Spanish, if one takes qualified majority voting as the determining factor in establishing foreign policy. Fianna Fáil is much more pragmatic on these issues and will come around eventually to the notion. However, the Irish left needs to get off its hobby horse on this issue because, if it is serious about ending the tyranny and standing up to the oppression we still see in the world, it must work with Europe in establishing a common foreign policy which is to the benefit of Europe and smaller states.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I welcome the Minister of State, who is the son of one of Ireland's earlier European statesmen. The other place to which Senator Brian Hayes referred, where he was speaking at the weekend, was Tipperary. We were commemorating the Emmet bicentenary and discussing Ireland's place among the nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">I join every other speaker in congratulating the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, Deputy John Bruton, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, and the team from the Department of Foreign Affairs on all their hard work in the Convention which appears to have been pretty successful. Having participated in similar forums myself, I am sure there were intense discussions between officials and politicians about the right way forward on certain issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I also pay tribute to the role played by Senator Maurice Hayes in the Forum on Europe, which has been travelling throughout the country and is due in Sligo next Monday, in explaining the issues and not allowing the consciousness of European issues to drop back again after the two referendums on the Nice treaty. That has been very useful work.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">We have a simpler and clearer text. Most of us would agree that the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties were barely comprehensible to most diplomats, let alone ordinary people. There were many cross-references.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I would warn against the received notion that the Convention is necessarily going to be the last word if it comes to an agreed conclusion. I do not believe that will be the case. Powerful interests are ranged across the political spectrum and I do not believe the notion that they or other groups are going to give up simply because there is a <i>fait accompli</i> in the Convention and certainly not as long as there is a chance of fighting the outcome on certain issues with which they are not satisfied. I can well imagine the Christian Democrats, who favour federalism, might be dissatisfied with some of the compromises in the Convention. We will be fighting for the best possible result right to the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Several people referred to our overwhelming interest in a successful European Union in the context of the benefit of EU membership. Like other speakers, I regret the apparent decline in enthusiasm and loss of confidence. Senator McDowell referred to this. The magnitude of the electoral majorities in Eastern Europe in favour of joining the European Union is similar to the majority in this country when we voted on the Treaty of Rome. It is interesting to reflect that six out of the ten accession states have smaller populations than Ireland. We are becoming a middling small state in the new Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The issue is coherence. We have to understand that vetoes do not work. There is no <i>realpolitik</i> in the notion that we can dig our heels in and delay the rest of Europe or overturn something we have already agreed. The only people who put that view forward as practical are those who have never had practical experience of government or the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The Commission rotation is a good compromise. The point of membership of the Commission is to know what is happening and to act as a sounding board so that others know the likely reaction in one's member state. The rotation was primarily determined by the need to build confidence in the accession states but it should have a positive effect on the confidence of public opinion in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I would not be frightened by the presidency of the Council or a so-called European foreign minister. They will only be able to act on consensus reached. I would be surprised if it were always people from the largest states who would pursue these positions. They may feel they have more power in their own country. Certainly the President of the European Council or the Foreign Minister will not dictate policy. In a sense he or she will receive it from common positions worked out.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I would like to touch on the issue of mutual defence. While I have a copy of the Fine Gael document, I have not read it line by line.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_271">I will read it. It obviously has the heavy imprint of the person whose signature appears at the bottom, namely, Deputy Gay Mitchell. It is not clear to me that we have to go as far as he recommends, particularly regarding mutual defence. Quarters other than neutral countries will block any attempt to establish the EU as duplicating or rivalling NATO, the core of which is the mutual defence commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I accept that Fine Gael has been under substantial and uncomfortable pressure from the Christian Democrat group for a number of years. While I do not deny that Fine Gael might genuinely believe this to be the best way forward, I am not convinced that we have to go so far. Going back to the 1930s, there has been two strands in Irish foreign policy: the policy of neutrality and the principle of collective security. The challenge facing our foreign policy in these conditions is marrying these two principles. I agree that Europe should be in a position to intervene in genocides and undertake active forms of peacekeeping and peace enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I am pleased that tax harmonisation seems to be safe for the moment. While the point has been made that circumstances may change in the future, that is hard to say. Tax harmonisation is currently our most vital national interest, apart from continued membership of the EU, which is in our overriding national interest. We ought to note that an exit mechanism is being provided. If any member state were to become obstructive, other partners would be able to point to the exit door in a more convincing fashion than heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Like other speakers, I am not frightened by the word "federalism". As was pointed out by Senator Dardis, while the EU has certain federal characteristics, it is not a federal state nor is it likely to be. Both Deputy John Bruton and I have made the following point. What differentiates the EU from the United States of America is the EU has minuscule revenues, just over 1% of the wealth of the Union. There will never be a powerful, centralised, quasi-dictatorial state taking away our sovereignty as long as this is the case. The reality is that member states are in charge and we need not worry about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Those that are concerned about values, especially Christian values and ethos should be reassured by the draft that is being prepared. Senator Lydon alluded to this. Even though God is not in the preamble, there is recognition of churches, church schools, rights to marry and found a family, etc. I am sure everyone will have noticed and welcomed the strong intervention of the Pope in the Polish referendum. I hope that in future debates people will pipe down on this aspect. I do not see it as being under threat. The European charter on human rights and the best in European law have something to contribute that can enrich us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_77">
          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_276">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the succession of Ministers who have come here since, for attending this debate. The Members who have sought the debate epitomise a particular tenor of this Seanad in concentrating on European matters. The Joint Committee on European Affairs, of which our spokesperson, Senator Ormonde, is a member, has kept to its task since the Convention started. Pat Cox and the Irish members of the Convention have attended debates in this House. All of them infused us with information and rendered us receptive to the progress of the Convention and its report.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">With the benefit of hindsight, it now seems politically astute of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing to have first released reports of such scope that they took the breath away. Everyone drew breath and hoped they would not be the final version. While we do not know what the final text of the report will be, its firm shape is beginning to emerge. There is not much cause for dread in this for Ireland. We are all parochial. While we have believed in "project Europe" both before and since joining the EU, our enthusiasm has varied as years have passed. This is a natural thing. We were flushed with enthusiasm for the project in the beginning and voted in substantial numbers to join it. In terms of responses to the Eurobarometer surveys, we remain strongly attuned to, interested in and enthusiastic about Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Poland showed the first flush of enthusiasm for the project in its recent referendum on joining. They had two days of polling. On day one 17% cast their votes, while over 40% voted on the second day. In an electoral sense, I found this interesting. Perhaps this could be looked at in elections here. When it emerged that only 17% had voted on Saturday, it allowed for the momentum to be increased and for people to cast their votes on Sunday. Poland is experiencing the first flush of enthusiasm and I hope it lasts a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Ireland retains a steady adherence to European matters in social, economic, security and economic spheres. These are issues with which we feel an affinity with Europe and wish to express it. We have moved on from being a "go raibh maith agat" country and no longer talk only about what we can get from Europe but also what we can put into it. I have always believed that we contributed to Europe. In my years of attending ministerial councils I felt that as a small country, Ireland had as much to give as bigger countries. We had our opinions, voice and convictions and this contributed to coherence in decision-making.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">As Senator Mansergh has said, we are trying to bring about a sense of coherence without making it an overriding compulsion or a straitjacket. This is the course we have steered under the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the members of the Convention, Deputies John Bruton and John Gormley and Mr. Proinsias De Rossa, MEP. We also have a strong sense of conviction of being Europeans of the highest order.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">We must steer a course which encompasses coherence but which does not place anyone in a straitjacket, while also allowing ourselves access to our nationalities, cultures and histories. It is often a sense of shared history that is brought to bear on certain issues, whether social or commercial. The countries of Europe have all been either strong colonial powers or have struggled for independence and nationhood. It may seem strange, but in debates on particular issues in Europe there is a wonderful sense that small is the same as big and that each type of country is entitled to its own opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">I appreciate the fact that Minister of State came before the House today. He has now departed for Brussels and, as the Convention comes to its conclusions, we wish him good luck in the days ahead and await his return. I thank the Minister of State, Mr. Gallagher, and the others who were present during the debate.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_78">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_283">I thank Senators from all sides who, I understand from my colleagues who were present prior to my arrival, made a very constructive contribution to this most important debate. I congratulate the Seanad for taking the opportunity to engage in a comprehensive discussion on this important issue and I thank it on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Senator Ormonde and others rightly identified the progress we have made on the issue of the size and composition of the Commission. There were fears for a considerable period that some of the smaller countries would have junior commissioners without the capacity for any major input, but that difficulty has now been overcome, thanks, in no small measure, to the contributions of our representatives. This is an advance on what was agreed at Nice, which would never have been generally accepted by many of the smaller countries which would have been obliged to have a junior commissioner. Ireland will be able to nominate a commissioner at all times. This is a significant step forward and it respects the key principle of equality between member states. I strongly agree with the Senators who stated that one of the key points is that all representatives will be called commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Senator Ormonde welcomed the move towards granting greater power to national parliaments and I fully agree with this. The draft treaty contains a number of proposals that will be strongly welcomed by citizens throughout Europe and particularly those in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Reference was made to the horizontal provision in Articles 51 to 54 of the charter. The horizontal provision was amended to allay the fears of those who felt that the charter would be used to extend the competence of the Union without changes to the treaty. The new horizontal provision clarifies the scope and application of the charter to ensure that it applies only to the EU institutions or the member states applying EU law. Article 54 has not, in fact, been amended, but has remained intact.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Senator MacSharry referred to the EU's signing up to the Convention on Human Rights. This issue is dealt with in Articles 1 to 7 of Part 1 of the treaty. He also referred to qualified majority voting and made an important point about its extension, namely, that the Government is committed to the general extension of QMV, but as the Senator pointed out, there are some areas – with which we are all too familiar – such as taxation, that we wish to remain subject to unanimity.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Other Senators spoke about defence, justice and home affairs and economic governance. Much of the debate on these areas is contained in Part 3 of the constitutional treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Taxation was mentioned by many Senators. The Government has made clear throughout the Convention process that it opposes a move towards harmonisation and the introduction of QMV in this area. We have taken every opportunity to make this point and have worked with a number of partners in this area. This is not an issue on which we are isolated and we will continue to press it at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The proposal to combine, or double-hat, the position of high representative with that of external relations commissioner offers the prospect of greatly enhancing the Union's contribution on the world stage. I welcome this idea on the grounds that the proposed Union minister for foreign affairs will bring greater coherence and visibility to its external relations. I have pointed out that there should be distinct and separate lines of accountability to the Council for the common foreign and security policy and to the Commission for the non-foreign and security policy matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">One area in which we continue to have reservations is the proposal for the Union's minister for foreign affairs should chair the external relations council, which we feel should continue to be chaired by member states. We have also proposed the appointment of deputies to assist the Union's foreign minister in his or her work.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Senators referred to the question of large versus small states on a number of occasions during the debate. I stress that the Government has never viewed the Convention as a battle between large and small states. We have worked closely with all our current and future partners in the Union, both large and small, on issues of concern to us. I fully agree with the views expressed that the work of the Government in the Convention was to try to improve the draft constitution for all concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Senators mentioned the issue of whether God should be mentioned in the preamble to the constitution. We must recognise that a large number of members of the Convention do not wish to see such a reference in the constitutional treaty. I, and the Government, of course, would be quite happy to see a reference to God in the constitution, but this is an area in which consensus will be difficult to achieve. Let us hope, however, that it can be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">It was suggested that the changes amounted to a tweaking of the text of the Nice treaty. What the Convention has done is much greater than that. It will simplify and codify existing treaties. This was a key reason for the Convention, as set out in the Laeken Declaration. The treaty will make the aims, values and objectives of the Union clear. It will set out clearly and concisely what the Union is and what it does.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The constitutional treaty will simplify procedures and decision-making structures. These are very positive elements which will be strongly welcomed by the citizens of Europe. It will be necessary to brief and consult the people we represent. I fully agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, that there is a need to ensure citizens are fully informed about the outcome of the convention and the work of the Intergovernmental Conference which is to follow. Irish representatives have appeared frequently before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and the National Forum on Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">It is vital that, when we come to put the treaty for ratification, the people are not presented with what they may possibly regard at this stage as a <i>fait accompli</i>. It is important that there should be a wide ranging and comprehensive debate on Europe, in an open and transparent manner. All of us can recall the first Nice treaty referendum in which I, for one and many others likewise, did not play the role we should have played in communicating the treaty to the electorate. That responsibility rested particularly at a political level. In the second referendum all was changed – we went out and played a more important role.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The treaty is in a language almost impossible to understand. Sometimes we may ask whether that is deliberate. It is vitally important there is not a communications gap between citizens – the most important group – and the various European institutions. The constitutional position with regard to mutual defence arrangements is clear: Ireland cannot join an EU common defence without the approval of the people in a referendum. In our response to the draft articles brought forward recently by the Praesidium of the convention, Ireland has noted that a provision for a possible EU common defence is already contained in the current EU treaty, whereby this is for decision by the European Council, acting unanimously, and the member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. Inclusion of a further such provision in the treaty is, therefore, appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Reference was made to the Polish situation and the idea of a two day referendum. That is a matter we should consider but it does not arise until the referendum is being put to the people. In the intervening period the forum established by the Government some years ago is extremely important and has brought Europe closer to the people. It has addressed a major communication deficit during the period, which we need to address even more closely in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I thank all Senators for their important contributions to this debate which, I hope, is the first of many to be held in both Houses and throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">Amendment No. 1 tabled by Senators McDowell, Ryan, O'Meara, Tuffy and McCarthy, if adopted, would have the effect of applying entitlements under the Bill from 10 July 2001, the date on which the directive was due to have been implemented by Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The House will be aware that we have included pay and pension entitlements of fixed-term workers under the definition of remuneration. This is estimated to cost the Exchequer some €50 million per annum. We have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that the directive did not require us to include such entitlements and, as a result, these entitlements can only apply from the date of enactment of the Bill. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">I want to advise the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is attending the International Labour Organisation meeting in Geneva and is unable to attend this evening. That is why I am taking the Bill on his behalf.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">On the advice from the Attorney General's office, my understanding is that a European directive is enforced from the time it is passed and that one cannot delay the spirit of the directive merely by waiting for the legislation to be carried through. Although I am not an expert in this area, I would have thought that the directive applied from the time it was passed and that, effectively, from that date in July 2001, the spirit of it was in place. I am not sure what that means in any real sense, but that is the normal approach and it is always the case. It is a constant factor in directives that they are in operation from the time they are passed. They are not delayed simply because the implementation issue has not been dealt with.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">There are two issues here. The Minister of State will understand that I am talking about people who have a contract of employment with an employment agency for a period. If such a person wishes to be protected by this legislation, there is no reason why that should not be allowed. Perhaps it is a matter with which the Minister of State proposes to deal, but I cannot see any reason somebody working for an employment agency should be treated any differently from somebody working for an auctioneer or for anybody else.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_316">We discussed this briefly at the end of the debate last week on Second Stage and the Minister told me at that stage that it was intended to deal with the position of temporary agency workers at a later stage. However, we have since discovered that in so far as it may be intended by the European Union to deal with it, we in this country are doing our level best to ensure that they do not, or at least not in a fashion which would be satisfactory to Senator O'Toole and me.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">There is an increasing number of people who are working with employment agencies or for whom employment is basically arranged by an employment agency. Most of them, although not all, are non-nationals and there are increasing reports that many of these people, who are quite vulnerable, are being abused, that their conditions of employment are not up to scratch and that, far from getting the protection which this Bill affords other employees, they are not even getting their basic rights. This is simply not satisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">It requires more than legislation to guarantee that workers will not be exploited. Legislation does a certain amount to rebalance rights and the power of workers and employers. In some circumstances, employees who may be entitled to take a job in another place of employment because they have the necessary qualifications and are well settled in a place can ask to be included in a pension scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Those who come here from southern Africa, for example, do not know the scene and may well not be aware of their rights. They may not speak English and may work exclusively for employment agencies which organise their work permits. They are in a vulnerable position and number many thousands. This Bill will offer them some protection. It seems that the Minister of State does not intend to extend protection to them by way of the Bill and it is disappointing that he and his colleagues are in Brussels busily consorting with the right wing conservative governments of several countries to frustrate any effort to protect them. He will have a hard job persuading me or others that is something we should do. This is being done in the name of flexibility and that it is in the interest of workers to be employed for a short period to enable them to be trained or settled and that they should then move on. This ignores the nature of the relationship between employer and short-term temporary employment agency workers – a David and Goliath relationship. The rights of workers must be enshrined in legislation. As one step in that direction, I ask the Minister of State to accede to the amendments in my name and that of Senator O'Toole.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_320">I propose to discuss amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together. I thank the Senators who tabled them.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">At the conclusion of the Second Stage debate Senator McDowell raised the matter of the exclusion of agency workers from the scope of the Bill. I wish to clarify that this was done in accordance with the terms of the framework agreement on fixed-term work annexed to Directive 1999/70/EC which provided that the agreement applied to fixed-term workers with the exception of those placed by a temporary work agency at the disposition of a user enterprise. This was done because a separate directive for atypical workers, that is, agency workers, was to be agreed by the social partners at European level as had previously happened in the case of the part-time and fixed-term worker directives. These negotiations broke down in May 2001 and the draft directive in this area was subsequently published by the European Commission in March 2002. It has been under discussion in Brussels since. Accordingly, agency workers were excluded from the ambit of the legislation because of the provision in the framework agreement. They are already covered in the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001. It is the responsibility of the Italian Presidency to advance the temporary agency dossier.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I consider it appropriate that such workers should now be included in the scope of the Bill. It will be necessary to secure agreement from the Government for their inclusion but such agreement will not be possible prior to Report and Final Stages. I intend to report on this matter on Committee Stage in the Dáil and update this House after the passage of the Bill in the other House.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_88">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_323">That is positive news. Previous legislation covers these workers, many of whom are not temporary. I agree with the point made by Senator McDowell. The workers concerned have been walked on and, in many cases, subjected to slave conditions of labour. There is the potential for them to be underpaid and oppressed in many ways which is the reason they require protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I understand from what the Minister of State has said that he accepts the tenor of this proposal and will return with an appropriate wording following Cabinet consultation. On that basis, I am happy to withdraw my amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I welcome the Minister of State's response. What he proposes will add significantly to the protection of the workers in question. Without wishing to be churlish, will he explain what his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, meant when he said on radio that any efforts to extend undue protection to temporary workers in the directive currently under negotiation would be bad, distort the labour market and bring to an end the Celtic tiger, if it was not already dead?</p>

This definition is not the same as that contained in the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 but is similar to the definition contained in the Payment of Wages Act 1991 which excludes expenses.

The Minister of State rightly made much of the Government's decision to define equal treatment as also including wages. It gives greater teeth to the Bill and the protection afforded by it. A logical further step would be to acknowledge that people are sometimes paid by benefit-in-kind. Those on fixed-term contracts may also receive benefits-in-kind.

          <p eId="para_356">I appreciate that this reads as a very cumbersome amendment, but I will try to explain it. A provision in the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, which should also have been included in this Bill, has been excluded. It relates to the fact that the comparator to which we refer can either be a person of the same gender or a person of the opposite gender – it can be one or the other. This is important because the employment equality legislation which ties into this refers only to people of the opposite sex. The failure to include such a provision leaves an argument wide open for an unscrupulous lawyer, or indeed a scrupulous lawyer. With due respect to, Senator McDowell, we know how much we love lawyers. There is a hole in the wall through which somebody can walk. I think I have covered this gap with the wording of my amendment, but it sounds cumbersome.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">If a change of this nature is not included – I believe the amendment uses the exact wording of the 2001 Act – it will mean that a comparator cannot be of either sex.

Its purpose is to provide that the Labour Court will, on appeal from a rights commissioner's decision, have similar powers, where an employer fails to provide a written statement or where such a statement is evasive or equivocal, to draw any inference it considers just and equitable in the circumstances and to determine whether the employee's contract should be a fixed-term contract or a contract of indefinite duration.</p>

I would like some clarification as to the objective grounds or the reasons that may exist for the renewal on a fixed-term contract basis, rather than a contract of indefinite duration.

          <p eId="para_376">Senator Mooney made an interesting contribution to the Second Stage discussion last week when he pointed out that RTE uses rolled-over fixed-term contracts. It does so, I suppose, largely to give it flexibility, in so far as it may want Senator Mooney's particular type of music one year but may not want it the next because it may not be as popular. Presumably, it also does wants to maintain a certain flexibility in terms of the rights which it gives employees because if it does not get a licence fee increase – although I accept that it got one this year – or it is under pressure financially, it may not necessarily be in a position to employ people full-time.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Let us leave Senator Mooney out of this and take it, for the sake of argument, that RTE says it wants flexibility because it is not sure a programme will be popular. Is that a sufficient reason to justify a fixed-term contract rather than employing somebody? If it says that it does not know how much money the Government will give it next year, or how much money it will make from advertising and therefore it needs flexibility in regard to how many people it has on its books, is that a good objective reason for a fixed-term contract? Is it envisaged that such reasons would be considered sufficient?</p>

          <p eId="para_387">In page 10, lines 37 to 40, to delete subsection (1), and substitute the following new subsection:</p>
          <p eId="para_388">"(1) Where an employee has completed one year of continuous employment with his or her employer or associate employer</p>
          <p eId="para_389">(a) his or her fixed term contract may be renewed on only one occasion and</p>
          <p eId="para_390">(b) where the combined period of the fixed term contracts exceeds 4 years, the contract shall be regarded as being a contract of indefinite duration."</p>
          <p eId="para_391">It has been referred to twice already that under the directive a consultation process took place between the social partners and the Department which was most effective. The view, certainly from the congress side, and as far as I know from the IBEC side as well, is that it was a most satisfactory process. Where problems have arisen it is because this has not been reflected in the Bill. No doubt those helpful people in the Department of Finance did their usual thing when they got it. The Minister of State may not be willing to admit that but those of us who know the ways of these people understand it. This scuttles what we are trying to do. During that process of consultation a consensus was reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I am not trying to embarrass the Department but there was a view held by it and the social partners that following one year's continuous service on a fixed-term contract, a renewal contract would be deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration. It was also agreed that the total period of that kind of increase would be time-limited. It had to stop and we had to agree on some particular time. It was also agreed that after the one-year period a rights commissioner could hear a claim as to the appropriateness of the status of the contract. In other words, could another fixed-term contract be justified or should it be one of indefinite duration? I suspect that this touches on the point raised by Senator McDowell.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The provisions of section 10, as currently written, has extended the one-year period up to four years. That has come out of the ether. I do not know where it has come from. Nobody ever discussed or agreed on that particular part of it. It provides no limit at all on the period of the renewal following that period. Any reasonable person would see that this could be grossly unfair. As currently drafted, the Bill allows an employer to employ a worker on a fixed-term contract for a period of one day short of four years and then renew that contract for another period, without any restriction on the period of that renewal contract. The way it is written defeats the whole purpose of it. Furthermore, there is no limit on the number of renewals that may take place after that first four-year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Effectively, a fixed-term contract worker could be employed under eight six-month fixed-term contracts in the first four years and that could be followed by a fixed-term contract of whatever duration the employer decides, at his or her sole discretion. That is the problem stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">This is the bugbear of flexibility. Flexibility is fine where it is necessary. What was attempted in the consultation was to be genuinely mindful of the needs of employers as well as employees. I want to make this point very strongly. What emerged from there was a balance. Let us remember that the directive came from discussions between the Commission and the unions and employers at European level. At a local level of consultation we came up with a process which did not include a reference to four years. What I am trying to do is get back to my understanding of the Department's position and what was intended by the European directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Section 10(1) should be deleted and replaced with the new words "where an employee has completed one year of continuous employment with his or her employer or associate employer, his or her fixed-term contract may be renewed on only one occasion and, where the combined period of the fixed-term contracts exceeds four years, the contract shall be regarded as being a contract of indefinite duration". Unless I am missing some point, I do not think that is unreasonable. That is as close as I can get to my understanding of what we were trying to achieve. What is the Department's view on this? This amendment seems reasonable to me.</p>

While I bow to Senator O'Toole's superior knowledge on this matter, it seems incredible that someone would have to serve a two to three year probationary period. I am aware that it has to do with the issue of flexibility, as he explained.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_398">I am in two minds about this. My major concern which I expressed on Second Stage is that this will become something similar to the tenancy arrangement where it is common for people to have a tenancy for four years and nine months, after which it is effectively terminated. I hope we are not creating a similar situation in regard to fixed-term contracts, that once one gets into the fourth year, or the fourth year plus a renewal, employers will seek to terminate the contract altogether.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">In recent years the courts and the Employment Appeals Tribunal have tended to look behind fixed-term contracts and if such contracts are clearly intended to deprive workers of their rights, they tend to set them aside because one is effectively seeking to opt out of, for example, the Unfair Dismissals Act. On balance, however, we should not have to rely on the courts to do this. We should try to be as explicit as we can in legislation in order to strike a balance. Perhaps one year is too little but I am sure that four is too long. Equally, the provision whereby the final renewal can be open-ended or not of specific duration will have to be changed. Even if the Minister of State is not inclined to accept the first part of Senator O'Toole's amendment dealing with the fourth year element, he might at least be significantly more specific about the final renewal element in order that it can be, for example, for a maximum period or particular purpose.</p>

It was never intended that such contracts would become permanent. The amendment addresses these concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">The effect of this amendment would be to include nurses in training within the ambit of the Bill. Section 18(<i>c</i>), as drafted, excludes nurses in training from the scope of the Bill in accordance with clause 22A of the framework agreement, annexed to directive 1999/70/EC, which provides that member states, after consultation with the social partners, may provide that the agreement does not apply to paragraph (<i>b</i>) – initial vocational training relationships and apprenticeship schemes. The Department of Health and Children requested that nurses in training be specifically excluded from the Bill for the avoidance of doubt.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">I do not have the directive to hand and have no doubt that what the Minister of State has read out is correct. The point is, however, that it was something which could come up in the consultation process with the social partners but never did. It was never discussed on this island prior to putting together this legislation and no argument was made to the social partners. I heard what the Minister of State said about the Department of Health and Children which may have a good argument as to the reason trainee nurses should be excluded but I would like to know what it is. What answer do we give to those who ask us the reason nurses in training are excluded? Nurses in training are different from many other groups; they are doing comparable work on wards with trained staff. It seems unfair that they should be excluded from any protection afforded under the Bill, unless we are missing something. If so, fair enough. As I am not an expert in this area, perhaps there is an issue about which we need to know. The Minister of State has told us that the Department of Health and Children did not want nurses in training included but did it make a substantial, enduring and convincing argument? If it did, perhaps we could hear what it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">Under section 2 of the Interpretation Act, on page 6, "fixed-term employee" means a person having a contract of employment entered into directly with an employer where the end of the contract of employment concerned is determined by an objective condition, such as arriving at a specific date, completing a specific task or the occurrence of a specific event, but does not include employees in initial vocational training relationships or apprenticeship schemes or employees with a contract of employment. This provision is included because the Department of Health and Children specifically requested that nurses in training be excluded from the Bill for the avoidance of doubt.</p>

I raised this issue on Second Stage and I could not understand why we adopted the derogation, even though it was available. I thought the Bill should apply to trainee nurses, trainee gardaí and members of the Defence Forces. I brought the matter to the attention of the Garda because I believe it would be helpful to include them in the Bill. However, it is a matter for the Minister and the Government. I understand that a derogation was available and that it was taken up. As someone who worked in Europe, I am aware that we received derogations on many issues but I never came across a derogation on a specific exclusion clause. The Minister of State should review the issue between now and the debate in the Dáil.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Act 2002.</heading>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_435">I welcome the Minister of State. When the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill 2002 was brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas in April last year, it was stated in the explanatory memorandum that the legislation was being brought forward as a matter of urgency. More than one year later, it has still not been implemented. I agreed at the time that it was needed as a matter of urgency because all over the country we were depending on non-EU doctors who had come here supposedly for training but were in fact holding the health service together.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">About three years ago the Medical Council decided that some posts around the country were, on inspection, not worthy of being called training posts. It did not recommend that non-EU doctors who had only secured temporary registration should take them. In its collective wisdom, the Government brought forward the Bill mentioned to allow the service experience of the doctors concerned to be taken into account in order that they could secure permanent registration after four years satisfactory service. This was quite reasonable in view of the fact that many of the people concerned were highly experienced in their own countries and were simply waiting to take examinations in Ireland. We were relying on them to take up posts which were not being sought by our own graduates and were not considered suitable as training posts. We badly needed to have people in position in order that there would be a service commitment in what were mostly rural hospitals. I am sure the Minister of State noticed there was trouble recently in Wexford hospital because this legislation had not been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Medical Council decided that six weeks in these posts could not be considered a sufficient time for training and refused to recognise temporarily registered doctors as taking those posts. It is a practical and serious issue. I do not understand why this legislation has not been implemented. I have had non-EU doctors writing to me who feel they have been shabbily treated and, frankly, I agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">One of the doctors asked me if it is because officials in the Department of Health and Children think that those who were here years ago and are now working in the UK will return and seek permanent registration here, while they are only entitled to temporary registration. That is not possible. Under the legislation that was brought through, we made sure that doctors who had been out of the country for 12 months could not apply for permanent registration.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">All those who have been coming here within the last number of years will be eligible for permanent registration with the changes that have been made. It is difficult to understand why this is going on. I am particularly annoyed because non-EU doctors have been important in the health service for decades. This was some way in which we could straighten things out a little for them, yet it has not been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">When this Bill was going through the House, the Minister for Health and Children said we could look forward to a completely remodelled Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Act in the autumn. I should have asked which autumn. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_441">I thank Senator Henry for raising this issue on the Adjournment. I am afraid I am not briefed regarding the Government's legislative programme, so I am not in a position to deal with her final query about the progress of the medical practitioners legislation to which she referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Act 2002 came into operation on 1 May 2002. The purpose of the amending legislation was to address, as a matter of urgency, issues relating to the registration of medical practitioners. These amendments were deemed necessary to avoid any threat to service delivery in the public health service and to deal with certain perceived inequities with regard to access to registration on the register of medical practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Like the Senator, I am well aware of the great contribution made by many, especially doctors from overseas, to our public health service. I am also aware of the difficulties they encounter in attaining access to the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The main proposal contained in the Act is to provide that account be taken of professional experience in assessing an application for full registration on the register of medical practitioners. Under previous legislation, only training and qualifications could be taken into account when considering such applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">This has had significant implications for non-consultant hospital doctors, usually non-EU citizens, who occupy service posts not recognised for training purposes. The amending Act also makes provision for intern registration and temporary registration to apply in a number of health care settings whereas the current legislation confines these types of registration to hospital work. Finally, it makes provision for any EU citizen who has obtained a primary degree within the EU to obtain internship registration in this country. Previously, only graduates of Irish universities could undertake their internship registration in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Under the provisions of the Act, the Medical Council – the statutory body with responsibility for the regulation of the profession – may prescribe rules relating to the registration of medical practitioners; rules for the recognition of health care settings in which training may take place; rules relating to the recognition of primary qualifications obtained from EU medical schools for the purposes of internship registration; and rules relating to short term temporary registration. The council must submit its draft rules for the approval of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and for laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The council submitted four sets of draft rules for possible amendments and approval relating to the areas outlined above. The Minister for Health and Children has examined the draft rules and suggested a number of amendments, which the council has addressed. He is currently re-examining the latest draft rules returned to him recently by the council. It is his intention to ensure that the draft rules will meet the requirements of the Act and to this end he has carried out consultations within the Department, the Medical Council and the training bodies. This process is very nearly at an end and he hopes to be in a position to decide on the draft rules in the very near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">In the meantime the Minister wishes to reiterate that no doctor has lost registration as a result of any perceived delay with regard to the rules. The Act makes provision for any medical practitioner who holds temporary registration, such as a number of non-EU doctors, and who has applied for full registration under the Act to have his or her period of temporary registration extended indefinitely until such time as a final decision is given in their application.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">At present the vacancy rate amongst non-consultant hospital doctors is less than 1%; the actual figure is 0.65%, which is based on 25.5 vacancies out of a total cohort of 3,925 non-consultant hospital doctors. This vacancy rate would be the envy of any commercial enterprise and indicates the status of the health service as being an employer of choice. These figures should be read in the context of a 20% increase in NCHD numbers over the last three years and is all the more remarkable when one considers the highly mobile character of this particular cohort as a medical profession. It is a testament to the Government's commitment to funding the highest standards of medical care and personnel for the Irish health service.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.</heading>
        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_451">I thank the Cathaoirleach for choosing this matter for the Adjournment.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The decision by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland on 29 April last to withdraw the broadcasting licence of North West Radio came as a bombshell to the station management, the shareholders and to its excellent staff. Above all, it came as a thunderbolt to the hundred of thousands of loyal listeners in counties Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim who, daily, have tuned into station for the last 13 years. The decision quite frankly stinks.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The injustices of it is put clearly into perspective when one considers that on the very day the BCI announced that it was not renewing the North West Radio licence, the station achieved a 68% listenership rating from the JNLR. This figure was no temporary blip or aberration. For the past 13 years, NWR has had consistently high listenership ratings. It has been invariably rated by the public as the most second most successful station in the entire country.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The way the decision was made is open to major question. There are ten members on the BCI, but only six were present for the deliberations on the vote. A 60% attendance for such a crucial decision is insufficient and indefensible. Three members voted for NWR and three for the rival consortium Ocean FM. It took the casting vote – in other words, a second vote – by the chairman, Mr. Conor Maguire, to carry the day for Ocean FM.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Those who voted against North West Radio also disregarded the presentation made to the commission by the BCI chief executive. The chief executive could not be more positive or complimentary to NWR. The shareholders and directors, he said, had remained largely the same. The management of the station by Tommy Marron and Mary Daly had been successful. Staffing levels were satisfactory and salaries were average for the business. The JNLR figures underlined the fact that the programme mix had been successful and balanced and he emphasised the commitment to drama and writing. Transmission and coverage was good.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">There was only one negative feature, the lack of disabled access. This had been addressed by NWR in its presentation to the commission. Just as is happening in Ballyhaunis with its sister station, Mid West Radio, a new state-of-the-art studio was to be built. The station had already opened a new wheelchair accessible state-of-the-art studio in Donegal town.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">In spite of its superb track record, its high listenership rating and the glowing analysis by the BCI's chief executive, the commission awarded the licence to a new consortium with absolutely no broadcasting experience. In its report, the justification of the commission could not have been more flimsy, more ridiculous or trumped up. It questioned the issue of shared broadcasting. However, for 13 years, neither the BCI nor its predecessor, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, raised this issue with North West Radio management. The listenership figures proved conclusively that joint programming is successful. How does this fit with the joint programming of Shannonside FM and Northern Sound radio and the two Cork stations owned by County Media?</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The whole thing is a sham. It is clear that merit, experience, track record and popularity count for nothing. It is patently obvious that political forces were at play. This is not the first weird or questionable decision by the BCI. Equally unfathomable were the decisions made in relation to the award of licences in counties Tipperary and Kilkenny but the NWR decision is the most unfair and bizarre of the lot.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">I welcome the decision by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to<b/>examine the role and composition of the BCI. It is farcical that a commission composed of people with absolutely no broadcasting experience should have the power to award valuable, commercial broadcasting licences. I welcome the commitment by the Minister to review the method of awarding commercial licences by the BCI but it is too late for North West Radio, or is it? Does the Minister have any power vested in him under the Radio and Television Act 1988 to put a stay on the award of a licence? Does he have the power to revoke a BCI decision where the decision made is patently unjustified and unjustifiable? If he has such power, he should use it to right what is an utter travesty.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_460">I thank the Senator for raising his understandable concerns about North West Radio on the Adjournment. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources would like to clarify that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has statutory responsibility for licensing local radio services. The commission, as provided for by this House, is an independent statutory body and the Minister has no role in relation to individual licensing decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I would like to address a specific question asked by the Senator as to whether the Minister has the power to put a stay on an individual licensing decision of the independent regulator. The answer to that question is clear: on the advice available to him, the Minister has no such power. If he had, the regulator could not be considered independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The Houses of the Oireachtas have provided that decisions on licensing should be taken by an independent regulator, not by Ministers. Were a Minister to interfere in the licensing process there would be uproar. It would make no sense to establish an independent regulator and then call upon the Minister to intervene if one was not satisfied with the decision taken by the regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The licensing of local radio services is a sensitive matter. As the Senator pointed out, it is a matter involving considerable commercial implications. This is especially the case where a local radio station fails to have a licence renewed, as occurred recently in a number of cases, in most of which the existing local radio stations took part in a competition for a new licence but were unsuccessful. The only reasonable interpretation of what happened is that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland took a view that the successful applicants best met the criteria for the award of the new licences. This does not mean that the unsuccessful applicants would not have provided a high quality service. It means that the commission took a view that the successful applicant would provide a better service. It is important that sight is not lost of the fact that local radio is primarily about the audience.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The only way to avoid hard decisions and controversy would be to grant licences in perpetuity and never redefine franchise areas. While licence holders might welcome this, it would not be in the public interest. It follows that there will inevitably be cases where licensees which have provided a high quality service will still lose out in a competition for a new licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The Minister recently announced that he was to initiate a review of the local radio licensing regime. He confirmed that the findings in the recent report on licensing by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources would inform his considerations. He explained that with the forthcoming establishment of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the conclusion of the current round of licensing, it was an opportune time to conduct a review which will be open to all interested parties and involve wide public consultation. The Minister has signalled that he is specifically ruling out the possibility of any increased ministerial or political involvement in the licensing process.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The Minister has indicated that the issues he wishes to consider include the following: whether there is a need for an appeals mechanism to deal with licensing decisions taken by the independent regulator; whether the costs of applying for a licence can be reduced without impairing the effectiveness of the process; and the need to ensure the independent regulator is seen to be fully accountable and objective in its decisions. The Minister will outline the specific details of the review in due course and give all those interested an adequate opportunity to have their say.</p>
