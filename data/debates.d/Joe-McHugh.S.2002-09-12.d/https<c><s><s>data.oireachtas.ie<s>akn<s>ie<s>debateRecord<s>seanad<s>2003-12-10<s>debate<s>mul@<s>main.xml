          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Mansergh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide essential improvements for health and safety reasons to Upper Newtown national school, Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, in next year's programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline when tender approval will be given for Gaelscoil Ó Doghair in Newcastlewest, County Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the impasse over the payment of a €65 fee to GPs for completion of a medical certificate for a disabled person's grant in the Midland Health Board region.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</p>

          <p eId="para_9">I regard the matters raised by Senators Mansergh, Finucane and Bannon as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.

          <p eId="para_12">We can all have a wish list for Christmas. The Order of Business is No. <i>a</i>1 on the Supplementary Order Paper, a referral motion whereby the subject matter of No. 1 on the Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food for consideration. These regulations concern a reduction in the disease levies applied to milk deliveries for processing and cattle slaughtered or exported to facilitate the eradication of TB and brucellosis in cattle. The rates have been reviewed in light of the improving disease situation and, as a consequence, there is to be a reduction in the costs of the scheme. This will be taken without debate; No. 2, a motion referring to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights the report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings. The committee will report back to the Seanad within three months. This will be taken without debate; No. 3, statements on defamation, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, Senators may share time and the Minister is to be called on to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of the statements; No. 4, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Bill 2003 – Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 2 p.m. and to conclude not later than 4 p.m; and No. 17, motion No. 26, to be taken, with the agreement of the House, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. This is a change from the proposed time of 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_13">We all await today the publication of the independent report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. In particular, those who lost loved ones in that terrible atrocity more than 30 years ago await the report. In agreeing to No. 2 and allowing the committee to go about its work of drawing conclusions from the report over the next three months, in no way am I agreeing that the matter cannot be debated in the House over the coming weeks or perhaps early in the new session. It is important that the Government is represented in a debate in the House tomorrow or early next week, so that it can reflect on today's publication and colleagues on both sides of the House can make their views on the report known. It would be utterly wrong for us to jettison this report to a committee of the House for a three month period without any debate whatsoever. The Leader has my support on No. 2, but I reiterate that this should not suggest that I think the matter should not be debated in the House over the coming three months. That would be the wrong signal to send out to those who have sought this report for some years. I urge the Leader to organise a debate on this matter as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">We have had some good debates in the House on the national drugs strategy, during which the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, has given a good account of himself. The problem of cocaine abuse, especially in Dublin, is escalating and must be addressed. Earlier this week the National Advisory Committee on Drugs pinpointed the problem of the rise in cocaine use in Dublin. The Government has continually failed to recognise this growing problem, using the argument that it is not emerging at treatment centres around the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">We need to get real on the problem of cocaine abuse. It is the next wave after heroin, which has destroyed so many communities in this and many other cities. Cocaine is a real issue and it must be addressed. I ask the Leader to convey my views on this matter to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, at the earliest possible time with a view to arranging a debate early in the next session on this problem. A range of measures is needed to address the problem of cocaine abuse. We are not well equipped currently when the Government will not recognise the extent of cocaine abuse in the city.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_16">I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that it would be a shame if we lost the opportunity to debate that report promptly. It is almost 30 years since the Dublin and Monaghan bombings took place. Many of us remember that day so well. Those who have sought the report need that debate immediately rather than it being put on the long finger.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre report on healthy or the lack of healthy lifestyles in certain parts of the country, which was published yesterday. We have always known that Ireland has different lifestyles from other parts of the world. We had not realised until yesterday the health implications for different parts of the country, for example, the east coast as against the south coast. There is a substantial amount of information in the report. The Minister will have much to say on it and we should invite him promptly for such a debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I draw the Leader's attention to legislation introduced yesterday in the United Kingdom on anti-depressant drugs that have been banned by the British Government. All but one of these drugs which are for young people have been banned because they lead to suicidal behaviour. We may well have taken action on this matter in the past and sometimes Ireland has been ahead of Britain in such areas. It is clear from this shocking report that it has only been discovered that a large number of anti-depressant drugs prescribed for young people may lead to suicide. Apparently, all but one are banned in Britain today. I hope we are ahead of Britain, but, if not, let us ensure our attention is drawn to the issue.</p>

        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_19">I also welcome No. 2 and I agree with previous speakers that we should not wait three months before discussing the contents of the important report being published today, particularly since it has already been suggested that the extent of information or co-operation from the British side was not complete. If that is stated to be the case, it would be an important matter that must be discussed and given a public airing. I presume the same motion will come before the other House. It is important that Members of this House are given the earliest possible opportunity to comment on that report, to lend support to the families of those affected by the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and to attempt to give closure to the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">In light of Senator Quinn's comments on the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre survey on health, I suggest the Leader put it to the Minister for Health and Children that decentralisation could be good for one's health.</p>

          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_22">I am glad the report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings is being published today. We have waited a long time for it and one can only imagine the suffering and grief of the families during the intervening period. The difficulty in not having a debate here is that a vacuum could develop which would be filled with supposition and conjecture. It is important for us to play a role in this regard. On the radio this morning, informed sources said there has been a lack of co-operation by the British Government. The British Government is a sovereign Government on friendly terms with Ireland. If a sovereign Government acted in the manner suggested, it casts a shadow over all our dealings with Britain and every other aspect of co-operation. It is vital that we have an early debate. I suggest it take place next week when we have had an opportunity to study the report. That does not take from the proposal that it should go to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, but in the current climate, a period of three months is too long. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this report in the immediate future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_23">I support the call of Deputy Brian Hayes for a debate on the abuse of cocaine. It is not taken seriously enough because it is often considered as a drug for the middle and upper classes. I compliment "Fair City" on highlighting this issue recently. A trend is developing in Ireland after discos where people return to parties in houses not to continue drinking alcohol, but to take cocaine. This is happening not only in urban, but in rural areas also. Senator Brian Hayes is correct that this problem must be taken seriously; otherwise it will lead to heroin abuse. It has been classified not only as a recreational, but a designer drug.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Much attention has focused on the Hanly report. I will not dwell on the merits of that report except to say that the Mid-Western Health Board area, which the Cathaoirleach and I represent, is regarded as a pilot area. There has been a big increase in the number of consultants and new services in areas such as neurology, which I welcome. However, I cannot understand the contradiction in terms with, on the one hand, the increase in the number of consultants in the Mid-Western Health Board area and, on the other, the Hollywood report which does not recognise the need for a radiotherapy facility in the same region. I have often raised the issue of radiotherapy. I hope that if there is an expansion of services in Limerick Regional Hospital and the area that radiotherapy would complement those other facilities that are put in place.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_25">I support the views of a number of Senators from both sides on an issue first raised by Senator Brian Hayes. It is essential that we have a debate on the report which is being published today. That debate would help inform the work of the joint committee on the issues it will explore. I agree it is too serious a matter to be left aside for three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I would welcome, if possible, a debate next week on the ESRI report on poverty. Sometimes the media coverage of such issues can be unbalanced in one direction or the other. Clearly much progress has been made in reducing consistent poverty but, as often happens in a time of boom, the relative gap widened. It would be a good idea to have an informed debate on that subject.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_27">I support Senator Quinn's call for a debate on lifestyle. We all have different interests and come from different walks of life and we may be able to make positive suggestions as to what we can do about improving lifestyle here, particularly for children, because the increase in obesity among children is very substantial. I have asked Senator Ó Murchú previously if he could get Irish dancing back into schools for ten minutes each morning. There may be other things that people can suggest. Children are fatter than they have ever been and it is sad to see.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_13">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_28">That is a very good idea.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMauriceHayes" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_29">I support the plea for a debate on the forthcoming report. I hope the Leader will balance the debate in such a way that it does not become an orgy of Brit bashing and do more harm than good. I have enormous sympathy for those who lost loved ones, who will not be brought back by it, and I have enormous admiration for the courage they have shown in remaking their lives over the years. I am a poor surrogate for the Protestant and Unionist people in Northern Ireland but this gives us some feeling of what many of them went through over this period when they saw unsolved crimes and perceived that there has been a lack of co-operation in dealing with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">That was then, however, and this is now. We have been through this awful period and are beginning to pull things together. The relationship between the British and Irish Governments over the past ten years has been very helpful and to say that we would have to review our attitude to the British Government could be destructive. If there is a debate, we must remember that the Good Friday Agreement draws a line under the past and we are trying to make our way into the future.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_31">It is nearly three weeks since the report of the Competition Authority was published. It highlighted Ireland's rip-off culture, stating that we are the most expensive and least competitive country in Europe. A former enforcement officer of the authority pointed out areas in which improvements can be made and we should debate the report, which the Fine Gael website highlights.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_33">There has been a huge response to the website, which is making people more aware. We must establish a body along the lines of the Criminal Assets Bureau to deal with the rip-off culture.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_18">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_34">I join those Senators who seek a debate on the report which will be published by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights today. The families of the victims must be complimented. They ploughed a lone furrow for 29 years when seeking justice for the forgotten. This State has not distinguished itself in dealing with this tragedy and the Taoiseach should also be complimented for taking the matter in hand and establishing the inquiry into the bombings. There was a lack of co-operation on the part of the British authorities and if that is all, as we hope is the case, that should be the extent of British embarrassment.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">Should the report go further, however, an appalling vista looms. The loss of life on that day was proportionate in terms of population to the loss of life in the Twin Towers attack on 11 September 2001. That places the scale of the atrocity in perspective. If we are to enjoy good relations with any country, they must be based on mutual respect and if anything is revealed in this report, it must be dealt with honestly rather than trying to bury it and to build on sandy soil. That will not lead to a sustainable relationship in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I refer to the new rural social scheme for 2,500 people announced in the budget. I welcome it but it does not go far enough to deal with rural development problems and there should be a debate on farming and rural development. Under the CAP reforms, farming and rural development will go hand in hand and it is important that we keep the portfolio under observation.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Will the Leader consider No. 17, motion 25 on the Order Paper, on fisheries? It is another portfolio that has been relegated to the second division. The location of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in County Cavan was a heavy psychological blow to fisheries. I am not being parochial but the headquarters of the fisheries sector could have been located anywhere from Killybegs to Castletownbere. The combination of the marine sector with communications eroded the democratic voice of fishermen. There must be a debate on this because we do not want the sector to be relegated to the third division.</p>

A headline in yesterday's edition of <i>The Times</i> read “Teens face obesity and infertility” and another in today's edition of <i>The Irish Time</i>s reads “An unhealthy time bomb ticking in our obese laps”. Teenagers in both Ireland and England have a tendency to overeat and Ireland has a drug problem which is particularly extreme from Balbriggan to Arklow. While <i>The Times</i> stated that young and old people get extremely good medical care, teenagers are being totally neglected. They are the leaders of the future so we must examine this issue.</p>

Once there is a crisis to be debated, we deal with it, but we are also well placed to give a long-term view on the future of agriculture. Will the Leader set aside time early next year for a number of detailed debates on the sector, not just on the Fischler proposals but on the type of farming we want in the country in the next 20 years? I welcome decentralisation to rural areas but we should try to protect the jobs that exist there now. We should consider a series of policy debates on the future of agriculture and try to develop a route map for the future of Irish farming.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, raised the referral of the report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. It will go to the other House too. It is important that we have the opportunity to debate it here because according to the Order Paper the joint committee will take public submissions within the three months prior to its report to the Seanad. Our debate could be seen as part of that submission process and we should view it in that way. We will likely receive the report in the new year. Senator Brian Hayes also raised the question of the national drugs strategy and the worrying aspect of the increased rate of cocaine abuse. The Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, with responsibility for drugs strategy, Deputy Noel Ahern, has been very good about coming here to report on his work. We could have a debate on that matter in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Senator Quinn agreed with Senator Brian Hayes about a debate on the report of the commission on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. He also asked for the Minister for Health and Children to come here for a debate on the annual report of the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre which shows an accelerating rate of obesity in young people. It would be useful to debate this too. He also mentioned the ban on all but one anti-depressant drugs for young people in the United Kingdom which seems to be sensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">Senator O'Meara also spoke about the report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and agreed that we should have a debate on this while the joint committee is considering the report. She also thought the report from the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre would be a good item for debate, with which I agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">Senator Ó Murchú wants the debate on the report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings to take place next week if possible. I will request it but I do not know if it will happen because, as Senator Dardis told Senators yesterday, the Taoiseach has communicated with our office to say he is keen to address this House on Northern Ireland and the EU when we resume. I do not know whether it will be possible for him or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to come next week, but I will ask them.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Senator Finucane also spoke about the increased rate of cocaine abuse and the problems that causes. He said that in the Mid-Western Health Board area, which is a pilot region for the implementation of the recommendations of the Hanly report, there has been an expansion promised in services such as neurology. He wondered, however, why that could not happen in tandem with the development of radiotherapy services in the same region. He has frequently raised this topic. A committee is being set up on the implementation of the Hanly report so perhaps there will be a chance to debate this issue in that forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Senator Mansergh also wants an early debate on the report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. He wants a debate on the ESRI report, Monitoring Poverty Trends in Ireland, news of which was a breath of fresh air to us all this morning. While noting that when incomes increase a greater disparity between high and low earners emerges, the diminution of long-term unemployment has made a significant difference. We should ask for that report and have a debate on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">Senator Henry spoke of the National Nutrition Surveillance Centre report and the rise in obesity among children.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Senator Maurice Hayes with his wisdom brought a note of balance to the issue of a debate on the report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 30 years ago.

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_82">I very much welcome this opportunity to set out in the Seanad some of my thinking on defamation, with particular reference to the issue of reform of our existing legislation. This opportunity arises at the end of a somewhat hectic ten day period during which we have had several noteworthy events concerning the topic of reform of the law on defamation.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">On 1 December, my Department organised a conference on defamation in the context of the Report of the Legal Advisory Group on Defamation and the commitment in the programme for Government to reform the law on defamation. I was gratified to see present at that conference a wide range of representatives from the major sectors of the Irish media. It was a very successful conference and I will draw today on some of the elements of my presentation on that occasion. I pay tribute to Senator Jim Walsh who was the only Member of this House who managed to get along to it. There was a good robust discussion at that conference, to which he can testify, with a wide range of views expressed by participants. I expect that all the contributions received on the day, as well as others received prior to that day, will soon be available on my Department's website to further assist and inspire further contributions. I did not respond to the issues raised on the day of the conference because I was there in a listening mode and decided it would probably be wiser to let everything sink in a little more. This debate is appropriate given that I have provided for a consultation period up to the end of January 2004. As I was in listening mode on that occasion, I stress that I am also in listening mode here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Last Friday, 5 December, I spoke at a symposium on freedom of expression organised by the Law Department of Trinity College Dublin. I note that in the intervening period a very important address was given by Onora O'Neill of the Royal Irish Academy on a related topic. I noted that growing attention was being paid to the right of freedom of expression and the responsibilities that flow from the exercise of that right. Given that the concept of freedom of expression or free speech is presumed to be a fundamental right in a modern democracy it is rarely subject to critical scrutiny. We are concerned here with something that is the very essence of a democracy – the right to communicate facts, opinions and comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">Bunreacht na hÉireann may have been adopted as far back as 1937, but it still provides in Article 40 that, subject to public order and morality, the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions. Free media have always been taken as one of the essentials of an open and democratic society. One of the founding fathers of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, asserted on the principle of free speech, "If it were left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter." That pronouncement, while understandable when viewed from the perspective of the Revolutionary War in America towards the end of the 18th century, is perhaps today somewhat less reasonable, given the way in which so much of the newspaper industry is now sensitive to market forces, concerned as much with profit, shareholder value and market share as it is with the dissemination of what can be termed "news" and opinions. However, it must also be said with some regret, and I hope I will not be accused as I have been on occasion of shooting the messenger, that there has been an element of dumbing down of much of the print media and, to a lesser extent, the broadcast media. Nevertheless, our courts in recent times have upheld the role of the media as important in holding up a mirror to society and as upholding the citizen's right to be informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">In a democracy government is accountable to the people. In those circumstances it is apparent that the people must be informed about what is going on in government, otherwise accountability means nothing. No one would suggest that government alone should inform the people of what it is doing, though in recent times many developed democracies as well as the emerging ones have introduced processes whereby government is seen to be more open, more transparent and more accountable. There still needs to be an independent mediator. Classically, in a democracy, that is a role assumed by the press which acts as a kind of watchdog on the affairs of government, mediating between the people and their government and what it is doing. Another American, Abraham Lincoln, once famously said, "Let the people know the facts and the country will be safe."</p>
          <p eId="para_87">Senators will be aware that the programme for Government of 2002 contained a commitment that the Government would move, in the context of a statutory press council and improved privacy laws, to implement reforms of libel laws designed to bring them into line with those prevailing in other states. We are now at a key point in a consultative and legislative process which I hope can take us all the way through to a reform of the law on defamation. The focal point of this process was the Report of the Legal Advisory Group on Defamation, which was published in June of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">When I brought the report of the advisory group to Government in June 2003, I emphasised, and I emphasise again to Senators today, that the group's report was not a report by me to Government or a report of the Government. No decisions in respect of the substance of the contents of the report have yet been made. I emphasise that because yesterday I noted that the first few lines of an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> announced that I was retreating from my proposals to have a Government appointed press council. I do not know how many times I have to say that was never my proposal, is not my proposal and, in all probability, will not be my proposal. What the Government agreed was to have a consultation period, before any action might be taken on foot of the recommendations, which will run until the end of next January.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">I hope today's proceedings will prove to be a valuable step in the consultative process feeding into one of the most important legislative processes that will occur in the lifetime of this Government. I have committed myself to a consultative approach because the issues with which we are dealing are of huge importance. As I said previously, reform in this area is not just another process of modernisation or policy initiative. It is not an area for casual experimentation but one of such serious importance that we have to get it right. I trust Senators will bring a sense of perspective and informed comment to the consultative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">This is not an area for casual experimentation or adventure. Any change in this area must be carefully thought through in all its implications. We cannot afford to get this process wrong. Therefore, I make no apology for proceeding carefully and with a degree of circumspection nor for engaging in consultation and reflection. On the contrary, any other approach would be inexcusable, bearing in mind the vital importance of the subject matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">It might be very useful to record some of the recent milestones in the area of defamation law. The key milestone in the process towards reform can be said to date from 1991, with the publication of the Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Civil Law of Defamation. In May 1994, the National Newspapers of Ireland published a draft defamation Bill. Their Bill was largely based upon the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's report. The main differences were that the newspapers wanted the complete abolition of juries in defamation actions; that the making or offering of an apology should be taken into account in awarding damages; and that defamation actions should be commenced within one year of publication. The Progressive Democrats published a defamation Bill in 1995, which dealt with three separate areas, civil defamation, criminal defamation and contempt of court. That Bill was not voted down on its Second Reading, but was effectively parked by the then Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">The Report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, which was published in June 1996, took the view that changes in the libel laws were necessary. The report dealt with issues such as the balance between privacy and press freedom and the introduction of an ombudsman for the newspaper industry to deal with complaints from the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">My predecessor as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform brought forward the scheme of a defamation Bill, which was agreed by the previous Government in December 2001. However, while that proposal is still extant, its progress has been influenced by developments, not least by the passage of time, the appointment of a legal advisory group and the commitment in the programme for Government to bring about change to bring Irish law into line with that prevailing in other countries in the context of reform of the law on privacy and the establishment of a statutory press council.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">The Government had accepted for drafting a Bill in December 2001. However, when I became Minister, I felt that, in view of new commitments in the programme for Government, further exploration of certain issues was necessary. In that context, I established the legal advisory group in September 2002 to assess the legal changes that may be required if Ireland's defamation laws are to be brought into line with those prevailing in other states. This initiative was designed to give effect to the commitment in the programme for Government. The group was given three broad terms of reference, which are well known. The advisory group report contains 23 separate recommendations. The media coverage and comment since the publication of the report have perhaps understandably focused mainly on the statutory press council. There is a number of other important recommendations in the report which have not been the subject of much media comment or analysis, for example the proposed new defence of reasonable publication, the suggested re-balancing of the role which judge and jury have currently in defamation actions that are commenced in the High Court, the Circuit Court to have jurisdiction in all defamation claims where the amount of the damages claimed does not exceed €50,000, a suggested one-year limitation period, as the NNI suggested some years previously, and the enshrining in legislation of a defence to be known as the "defence of innocent publication" that would be available to, among others, broadcasters, distributors, printers and Internet service providers. A suggested text for a new defamation Act that would replace the Defamation Act 1961 was put forward by the advisory group, which was very useful. Since we are concerned with a potential legislative outcome it is very informative to see how the recommendations translate into legislative form.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Many of the recommendations put forward by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on the Civil Law of Defamation were endorsed by the advisory group. Among those were the recommendations touching upon the making of an apology, court lodgements and the rationalisation of the defences of absolute and qualified privilege. It is a mark of the excellence of the work done by the Law Reform Commission that the report it prepared on this topic remains so influential and that so much of it has been adopted by all involved, from whatever perspective they have approached this topic of reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Senators will also be aware that from 1 January 2004, the European Convention on Human Rights Act will require every Irish court to interpret every judgment made on statute law in a manner compatible with the provisions of the ECHR. The most interesting implication of this change in our law of interpretation is that long-established rules of common law will fall to be re-interpreted as necessary to make them fully compliant with the ECHR and the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court. The somewhat different treatment of subjects such as privacy, reputation and freedom of expression which appear in the texts of our Constitution and that of the ECHR will have to be reconciled, bearing in mind that the Constitution always takes precedence in Irish law over any international convention. In that context, Dr. Gerard Hogan made a very interesting contribution in which he stressed that the differences between European convention approaches to privacy and defamation and the approaches of our own Constitution were not very substantial.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Much of our defamation law is contained in judge-made rules and rules of court which deal with topics such as the onus of proof, lodgements, apologies and the law relating to privilege. Other aspects of our law are to be found in the Defamation Act 1961. The coming into effect of the European Convention on Human Rights Act as part of our domestic law is bound to put hallowed principles of law and practice under the spotlight and is likely to result in different attitudes and emphasis in the future administration of our defamation laws by the courts. I mention the ECHR because the changes embodied in the new ECHR Act have the potential to alter the tone if not the entire substance of the debate on defamation law reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Another interesting matter on which I will not dwell too long is the case of Callaghan and Hunter <i>v</i>. Blom-Cooper in which on a preliminary issue Mr. Justice Aindrias Ó Caoimh in the High Court delivered a judgment on 31 July 2003. That judgment was the subject of a law report in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently but it has not really come to public attention. In that case, the author of a pamphlet is being sued for defamation by two members of the Birmingham Six. By way of preliminary issue, the author brought to the courts the proposition that by definition his pamphlet was an exercise in free speech and could not be unlawful. He sought to have the case decided <i>in limine</i> on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">As Attorney General at that time, I was joined as a party to that preliminary issue by order of the court. I can furnish to Members of the House the submissions made, but briefly, the submissions made by the Attorney General were to the effect that the right to publish statements concerning matters of public concern was wider than had been previously generally recognised and that in some cases statements of fact, as distinct from statements of opinion, might be privileged from action in defamation as a necessary adjunct of the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution and by the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Judgment in the matter was reserved and delivered at a point after the holding of the last general election, the publication of the programme for Government and the establishment and report of the legal advisory group. In brief, the High Court has held that a defendant can avail of the reasoning set out by the House of Lords in Reynolds <i>v</i>. Times Newspapers. Mr. Justice Ó Caoimh stated the following: “In considering the various authorities open to this court I am persuaded that the flexible approach represented by the decision of the House of Lords in Reynolds <i>v</i>. Times Newspapers is the most appropriate way of approaching the problems in the instant case in the absence of a clear legislative framework.” In effect, the court ruled against Mr. Blom-Cooper's submission that publication of his pamphlet was <i>per se </i>protected by the Constitution and the ECHR but allowed him to amend his pleadings to invoke the privilege accorded by the Reynolds decision. In short, the Irish common law of defamation has moved on since the programme for Government was published and the consultative process was commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">The question is raised by the quotation cited as to whether it is now necessary or wise to attempt a statutory reformulation of that aspect of the law, either along the lines of Reynolds or along the lines of Australian and New Zealand cases, the approach of which was rejected by Mr. Justice Ó Caoimh. It could be argued that the decision in the Blom-Cooper case delivers in part on the Government's stated intention to align the Irish law of defamation with defamation laws in comparable common law states. On the other hand it could be argued that the Reynolds formula suffers from a good deal of uncertainty and that a clear statutory reformulation is desirable to make the developing common law in this area more certain. This latter argument presumes that there is a clear statutory reformulation available which would be sufficiently flexible to allow further development and qualification of the privilege. I have not come to any fixed conclusion as to whether this matter should be the subject of express legislation. I can see arguments both ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">One of the most publicised recommendations of the advisory group was to establish a statutory press council with functions which would include the preparation of a press code of conduct and the investigation of complaints concerning alleged breaches of that code. The report sets out in some detail the main features of such a proposed council, including matters pertaining to its operation and structure. Its draft defamation Bill contains a template for the legislative intervention which the group believed would be required were such an entity to be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">In proposing the establishment of a statutory press council, the programme for Government did not attempt to define in advance the nature or composition of such a body. It seems obvious that there is not and never has been any legal inhibition on the press in Ireland establishing a voluntary press council if it wished to do so. A purely voluntary press council would of course have no legal authority and no enforceable remedy as a matter of law. I stress that the term "statutory" does not necessarily mean a council of the nature and composition envisaged in the advisory group's report. It certainly does not mean that the Government of the day should seek to appoint the members of a press council as a matter of executive discretion.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">The model in the report envisaged, as Members are aware, the appointment by the Government of a press council with substantial statutory powers to procure compliance with its rulings. There are two fundamental issues here which should not be confused. The first is whether a press council should be statutory or purely voluntary. That issue raises the question as to whether a press council, if it is desirable in the first place, should have power or status of any kind in statute such as to require the press to implement any finding made by it arising out of a complaint by a member of the public. Returning to the defamation conference, there seemed to be a consensus that any worthwhile press council would need statutory underpinning of some kind, no matter how the council was composed or who was appointed or elected to it. For very simple reasons, such as giving some form of legal privilege to its reports, that would be necessary. It has happened on occasions that an editor has apologised as demanded by a solicitor acting on behalf of a person claiming to have been defamed, immediately following which apology the journalist has sued the editor for defamation. If one has a system whereby there is any formal intervention in the suits between newspapers and those written about by newspapers, it is almost by definition requisite that there should be some form of statutory protection, at least from legal suit, for that council.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The second issue is as to whether, if a press council is statutory, it should be Government appointed or whether it could be otherwise constituted, for example, elected or nominated by bodies or groups which would be expected to create a balanced press council. The model examined by the legal advisory group is by no means the only or most obvious model for a statutory press council. I could easily envisage a body chaired by a judge and composed of nominees of a variety of groups to reflect the different interests involved. Such a body could reflect the interests of the public, media owners and journalists. The public interest might be represented in a number of ways, one of which might be a form of proportionate selection by elected public representatives to ensure that the Government of the day could never swamp the council with its sympathisers. Other models for the composition of a statutory press council may well be suggested. Some were suggested last Monday week, including the appointment of office holders, such as the Ombudsman or others, to function <i>ex officio.</i>It is in vogue these days to query the principle of self-regulation. As I said at the Department's seminar, I am not convinced that self-regulation is a bad thing in a democratic society. The media are now hoisted by their own petard because they have been uncritical opponents of self-regulation without once hesitating to see what the effect of that logic would be if it were turned on themselves. I am reminded of the scene in <i>A Man for All Seasons</i> when Sir Thomas More is talking to William Roper about legal protections. More asks Roper if he would cut down every bush to get at the devil, to which the enthusiastic young Roper replies that he would. More then asks Roper if he cuts down every bush and the devil then turned upon him and the wind blew the other way, what protection would he then have? The media have been in a coruscating mode of attack on all forms of self-regulation but have suddenly found themselves the victim of their own logic and rhetoric. I go against the current grain and say that I believe self-regulation, in many areas, functions very well indeed and that the state need not control everything in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">I equally believe that self-regulation must carry with it at least the notion that there are some rules to which injured parties can point in seeking redress from abuse of press power. That is the nub of the issue. Can press power be abused without defamation – by intrusion on people's privacy – in a manner which seriously injures innocent and vulnerable people? If so, are such people to be given any redress or protection from such non-defamatory abuse? If a newspaper proprietor or editor were to thumb his or her nose at generally accepted ethics and seriously injure an ordinary citizen would that be a case of "it's just too bad"? If the answer to the last question is in the negative, the question arises as to whether a statutory press council, however composed, should have some capacity to right wrongs or to deter future wrongs.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">In the past there has been a suggestion that people who are wronged by the media should have some form of redress from a press council. What form of redress could there be? The defamation group's report suggested that a jury might decide to accord the new defence of reasonable publication to a newspaper because of the extent to which that newspaper toed the line with the press council appointed under the Act. That was not sufficiently stressed at last Monday week's conference. The report tied the notion of reasonable publication to a willingness to accept press council decisions and to act on foot thereof. There is a subtle logic to that. It connects together the notion of a responsible press being allowed greater latitude. If the <i>Irish Daily Bugle, </i>for example, constantly ignored the press council, the defence of reasonable publication might not avail it because the particular politician of whom the <i>Irish Daily Bugle</i> had asked its question may have felt he would not get a fair deal from the newspaper since it had consistently ignored press council rulings. </p>
          <p eId="para_108">The chief executive of the Equality Authority wrote an article in a newspaper last Sunday week suggesting that a press council might be a vehicle for spreading equality values. That is not my purpose in proposing a press council and I would be wholly opposed to it. No matter how laudable or questionable equality values may be, the purpose of a press council is not to act as an organ of a new civic religion established by law to tell the media what line they must take on certain issues. An article such as Mary Ellen Synon's on the Paralympics, which was deemed offensive by most people, is one which it is possible to write, even if it is offensive, without infringing the law. We must be very careful before we go down the road of censoring people's taste and requiring them not to be offensive. That could turn us into a very suffocating society indeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The Government's programme links the three issues of privacy, public protection in the form of a press council and defamation law. The three issues are inter-related. I am more confident speaking to a political house than to other bodies in saying that in the world of <i>realpolitik</i> to engage in a bold adventure in one direction without being conscious of the need for balance would be politically naive. For me to do so would be naive if I were a backbencher, let alone a Minister. The three issues are connected and people should not imagine they can dine <i>à la carte</i> at a table on which they are set out. The interrelationship is set out in the programme for Government and I stand behind that sense of realism. I am open-minded on the exact substance and means of delivery of reform in each of the three areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_110">I come to this debate with a personal prejudice in favour of free speech and against unnecessary regulation but with a desire to ensure that we have vigorous and inquiring media functioning in our society. What I am trying to do, and will do in the lifetime of the Government, is to bring forward a reform which is sufficiently balanced to bring behind it the weight of a political majority in these Houses. It is in that context that I particularly value the input of this House. I welcome the fact that this House has chosen to discuss the issue at this point as part of the process which will lead to that balance being correctly struck.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_43">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_111">The Minister is very welcome to the House to debate this important issue. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the important matters of defamation, law reform and the regulation of the press. These are two entirely separate but not unrelated issues. The Government has sought to ensure that the reforms in each area are dealt with in a way that they appear to be dependent on each other. However, this should not necessarily be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">The tort of defamation involves the reconciling of two conflicting constitutional rights. This is why it becomes such a contentious issue. They are the right to free speech, as guaranteed by Article 40.6.1º of the Constitution and the right to one's good name, as guaranteed by Article 40.3.2º of the Constitution. These principles are also reflected in Articles 10 and 8 respectively of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The law of defamation in this country is primarily governed by the Defamation Act 1961. Despite advances in technology and the increasing breadth of the media and the Internet, that Act, which is over 40 years old, remains in place and has not been amended to any great degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">In recent times, there has been a near unanimous expression of support for the reform of the libel laws. In that context I find it wholly unacceptable that the Minister would seek to link defamation law reform with the regulation of the press. In October 2001, in a document entitled, Press for Change, Fine Gael published its proposals for a major overhaul of Ireland's outdated libel laws. The party broadly supports the proposed reforms as contained in the legal advisory group's draft Bill, however, it believes that the Bill as drafted fails to deal with many important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">Fine Gael believes that an apology should constitute real grounds for mitigation in court. Under the present regime, an apology made in good faith can be used against the maker as effectively constituting an admission of liability. This is wrong and needs to be changed. The early settlement of potential claims should be encouraged by lending legitimacy to apologies.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">It is Fine Gael's view that the rules governing court lodgements should be changed in defamation cases so that the acceptance of a lodgement will be accompanied by a declaration from the court vindicating the complainant. By the very nature of the case, litigants in defamation cases go to court for vindication, not for an award of damages. If the acceptance of a lodgement were to be accompanied by a declamatory judgment, the vast majority of cases would be resolved far earlier than is currently the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">It is the view of the party that juries should be retained in defamation cases. The abolition of juries in personal injury cases caused awards to rise sharply and their retention in cases of this nature is vital, particularly given the nature of tort. It would be very helpful if judges were allowed to issue guidelines to juries. An important addition to defamation law in this country would be the provision to allow a genuinely mistaken or inadvertent libel to be alleviated by an immediate apology.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Another important matter which the advisory group failed to deal with is that of deceased persons. My party is firmly of the view that the good name of the deceased should be protected. At present there is no protection and we have seen the consequences of the absence of such protection. In order to maintain balance between the parties in an action of this kind, it is important that the onus of proof remains as it is. It should continue to be the case that the defendant must prove the truth of the matter which he or she has published. Regardless of what model of press regulation is adopted, this side of the House wishes the reform of the defamation laws to be a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">My party is by no means a stranger to the important issue of press regulation. In October 2001, Fine Gael published its proposals for the regulation of the press in a document entitled Press for Change. We recognise that in any healthy democratic society a free and vibrant media is a key weapon in achieving greater accountability right across all sectors of society. Fine Gael supports an independent, effective and free press.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">Apart from Fine Gael's contribution to the debate on this matter, the question of libel law reform and the newspaper industry has been the subject of a number of reports and submissions over the past decade. The Law Reform Commission published a report on defamation in 1991. The 1996 report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry under the chairmanship of the former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Thomas Finlay, formally recommended the establishment of a press complaints procedure. Seven years later these recommendations have still not been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">In the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government, the present partners in Government undertook to reform libel laws in the context of a statutory press council. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform established a legal advisory group on defamation which published its report in March 2003. In addition to proposing a series of much-needed reforms of libel law, the advisory group advocated the establishment on a statutory basis of a press ombudsman and a press council. Both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Taoiseach are on record as supporting these proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">It is inconceivable that having spoken of traditional press freedoms and democratic societies, the Minister in the same breath advocated the establishment of a Government-appointed press council.</p>

Given that the legal advisory group has already produced a draft Bill for the Minister, I dearly hope that the seminar was not an exercise in aesthetics. I expect the Minister to give serious considerations to the issues raised there and that he will be open to the possibility of changing his mind on some of the more questionable aspects of his policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">Fine Gael is completely and absolutely opposed to a statutory press council which will comprise Government appointees.

          <p eId="para_133">I will confirm that to the Minister later. Fine Gael believes that this press council should set about developing appropriate codes of practice. It should appoint a press ombudsman who would be fully independent with full security of tenure and have a properly funded office with the remit of enforcing codes of practice developed by the press council. While Fine Gael believes that the ombudsman will require some statutory underpinning so that he or she can carry out his role effectively, the party does not support the concept of a press council which is statutorily appointed by the Minister. Such a series of appointments would leave the press council wide open to political interference and that is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Fine Gael does not dispute that some parts of the media are capable of being reckless with regard to facts and to the reputation of individuals. There is a growing realisation of the need for some accountability and regulation of the press. However, given the vital importance of the free press in a democratic society, great care and sensitivity has to be exercised in defining the rules governing this industry. There is a general consensus that the currently unregulated environment in which the press operates is no longer sustainable. An effective and efficient mechanism for regulating the press and for allowing legitimate complaints to be dealt with must be instituted. We must be equally careful that we do not introduce a system that militates against the vital role played by the free press in a democratic society. For this reason, Fine Gael believes that an independent press complaints system with some statutory underpinning represents the best way forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I welcome the manner in which the Minister has addressed the issue of defamation. As he rightly said, the programme for Government contained an undertaking to face up to this matter. There has been a long campaign in the media for such change but we must be mindful of balancing two important principles – free speech and the right of citizens to their reputation and good name. Freedom of expression, and particularly a free press, is fundamental to our democratic process. Any changes to the relevant laws must, therefore, be weighed carefully to ensure that there is no infringement on the freedom of the press. Freedom also brings with it a measure of responsibility but some people do not exercise that responsibility. Society needs regulation to maintain a good balance in this regard and that is why we have laws, but human fallibility means that freedom of any sort invariably will be abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">This debate has continued for over a decade during which time the media, including the newspaper industry and others, have been campaigning strongly for changes in the libel laws. At the conference to which the Minister referred, and elsewhere in the debate, the argument has been made that our libel laws were in some way a barrier to exposing many issues, such as the planning abuses that have become the subject matter of various tribunals. I wonder if that argument stands up to scrutiny, however, because while the media were critical of many of the rezoning problems during that period, particularly rezoning that took place against the advice of planning officials and other council staff, it is fair to say, looking back, that they were also misguided. Officials can suffer from the same levels of human fallibility as councillors and elected representatives. On reflection, I wonder how journalists would have made the necessary distinction between those who were operating from genuine motives and those who were not. Could it have led to a situation where innocent as well as guilty people would have been defamed? That is an important question that must exercise all of us in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">Another important aspect of this debate is that good investigative journalism should be encouraged. We have seen fine examples of such journalism which did the State some service. One example is where it led to a chain of events that was responsible for the establishment of one of the tribunals and perhaps others. Any change in the libel laws must be undertaken with caution to avoid lazy or malicious reporting which does not take the trouble to obtain the necessary evidence. Such reporting may end up defaming innocent people. We must be mindful of the power of the media against the vulnerability of the individual, which must be taken into account in any changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">As a result, there is a strong onus on the media to be responsible and objective in its reporting. While there must be room for comment and opinion in newspapers, there was a time when it was identifiable as such, but this is not always so now. Much straightforward reporting is laced with a degree of bias as it reflects the opinion of the writer. Given the influence such reporting has on society generally, that aspect should be examined. There is no difficulty with reading opinion or advice columns as long as they are clearly identifiable as such. Where such opinion occurs more subtly as part of reporting, however, it can have an undue influence on people.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">It may be due to competition but sometimes the headline of an article has no bearing on its content. It is almost as if it is designed to be controversial and grab people's attention and, in the case of the front page, perhaps to sell the newspaper. I wonder if competition is lowering standards in this regard. We embrace competition in many areas of business because it is generally good, but in this instance I wonder whether it is having a converse effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">At the conference we attended, the former chairman of the British Press Council, who is a Queen's Counsel, commented that the standard of journalism in Britain is very low. We may all have come to that conclusion independently, but it is interesting that someone in such an important position should comment in those terms. The secretary of the National Union of Journalists used similar terms to acknowledge that journalistic standards have declined in Ireland. That is worrying and it needs to be addressed. Unfortunately, over the past year, I have seen an almost paranoid response to comments made by people in public life or elsewhere that were critical of the media. The media would do better to stand back, reflect and ask whether there are some elements of truth in what is being said. In some of those instances, objective comment went out the window and there was no attempt to be fair in response.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Some interesting comments were made by representatives of the National Newspapers of Ireland, the NUJ and others who addressed the conference. Many, but not all, of those attending the conference were in favour of media self-regulation. That begs the question, however, that if the newspaper industry has been campaigning for ten years to change the libel laws, and at the same time there was a need for some sort of self-regulation, why has it not happened? Why was the initiative not taken? At this stage of the game, when it looks as if we are heading towards the establishment of a press council, that undermines the argument for self-regulation. I noted that, in a well presented and balanced argument, Mr. Fintan O'Toole took issue with the idea of media self-regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">It was a pity that more politicians did not attend the conference because many of the contributors displayed a strong bias against politics of every hue. I checked my notes on the conference yesterday and at one stage I had written "biased" and "almost paranoid" concerning some of the contributions. They spoke about politicians in terms where, if they had been talking about coloured people, Travellers or asylum seekers, they would be charged with incitement to hatred by making racist comments. We must have broad backs, however, to take such criticism.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">I took note of one comment by an editor who said the press is there to challenge those who see themselves as being in power. There was nothing about analysing objectively or reporting critically and fairly; it was a case of "regardless of what they are coming up with, we are going to challenge those who see themselves as being in power". I thought there was an air of self-importance in the comments but a little humility does no harm, whether we are involved in politics or any other sphere of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">I compliment the Minister on the consultative process upon which he has embarked. My interpretation of the conference was that it was an exceptionally good reminder to us to proceed very cautiously. The legal advisory group on defamation deserves to be complimented. It has come up with a comprehensive report at the invitation of the Minister. As he rightly pointed out also, the recommendations we are debating are theirs. They are not the Minister's or Government policy but it is important that we examine them and comment upon them because presumably the Government will make decisions on how they are to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">Interestingly, and I suppose not surprisingly, many who spoke from the media and newspaper industry at the conference said this did not go far enough in their view. My view is that they have probably gone too far and I would be inclined to recommend that smaller steps and a progressive approach be taken because there has been a failure of the law to balance the right of free speech and the entitlement to good reputation. If we tilt the balance wrongly, the damage to the individual cannot be undone whereas in terms of the right to free speech, it would be fair to say that that is reasonable. If there are limitations on it because of the libel laws they should be changed, but doing it in a progressive and phased fashion means we are erring on the side of caution in the face of the individual. Our Constitution is tilted in favour of the individual, and we should recognise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">The defence of reasonable publication, where the purpose of discussion of some subject was for the public benefit, can be used as part of the defence. There are various other areas such as honest publication etc. which may need to be clarified and clearly defined. Otherwise, it could make it very difficult for an individual who has been defamed to obtain redress. In drafting the legislation we should be careful that is not the outcome of the whole process.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">I welcome the fact that juries will continue to be involved in the process. The awarding of damages is an area that must be examined because the financial deterrent is the best deterrent for the media in terms of complying with regulations and indeed with a press council. Where there are frequent offenders in terms of decisions of the press council and the code of conduct in the area of defamation, a seven day closure would be imposed by the courts, as we did with regard to the pubs, perhaps on application of the press council.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">With regard to the Circuit Court, the €50,000 limit should be increased to €100,000. The one year time limit to allow a person to make a claim for damages should be increased to three years. The question of lodgements in court is something which should be carefully examined. In cases where a lodgement is made and there is a denial of liability, if the court recognises there should have been an apology the lodgement should be set aside and should not affect the outcome in terms of the individual involved.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_151">I am grateful to Senator Walsh for allowing me share his time. I have an interest to declare as a director of Independent Newspapers but I do not speak for them or for the National Newspapers of Ireland. I had the privilege of spending a day with the Minister at the conference referred to earlier and I would like to assure Members that I did not regard it as a cosmetic exercise. People even more hard-nosed than myself in the newspaper industry were impressed by the Minister's approach and his openness, and I congratulate him on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Regarding Senator Walsh's comments about paranoia, I spend a lot of time talking to journalists and I constantly tell them that nobody up there likes them either. They are almost paranoid, and the Minister better have regard to that. There is a slight danger in generalisation in that some Members of the Oireachtas are more hubristic than others and I do not believe we would all want to be judged by that standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">We talk about journalistic standards falling but there are very good journalists working in this country and elsewhere and the objective should be to try to raise the standard professionally. If that were done, it would remove many of people's other concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The change in the libel law is important, not in the interests of the newspapers, or indeed the Dáil, but in the public interest. Ten or 12 years ago, in news rooms in Dublin, I remember being told, by name and specifically, what was going on in certain places that people could not deal with. Sadly, those names included both politicians and officials. An issue arises in that regard to which I will return.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">I believe in a press council and there is nothing inconsistent between giving it a statutory background and independence. After all, the General Medical Council and other organisations work within a statutory framework. The important aspect is independence, particularly in terms of an ombudsman, and that requires privilege of some sort. The people in this area should be encouraged to produce their own codes of conduct based on the best journalistic, sub-editing and editing standards. We have a better chance of getting compliance with that than something that is imposed. I agree with the Minister that we cannot legislate for taste and it is a mistake to try to do so. We have had sad experiences of censorship to which nobody would want to return. I congratulate the Minister on the approach he is taking. Having a public debate is vitally important and I agree with him that in political terms, issues are bundled and it is not possible to unbundle them.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I am conscious of time and the Chair's indulgence. I want to leave the Minister with a thought for the day which was brought to my notice by a former colleague, Senator John Horgan. This is a quote from Bishop Con Lucey speaking in 1937 in which he states:</p>
          <p eId="para_157">A libel law which tends to kill criticism of public officials, slum landlords etc., except the criticism be clearly in the public interest, ought to be replaced. It is too much to expect any private individual who has damaging revelations to make to know beforehand whether these revelations will do good or not.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">As Bishop Lucey is not always portrayed as an apostle of liberal values these days, I thought it was interesting that he had reached that conclusion and that he had got it in one.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">In changing the libel laws we consider the interests of newspapers, big people and the rest of it but the people who are most pressed upon by the current libel laws are the little people. I have been libelled but I could not afford to do anything about it. Giving these people the right to have their name vindicated and their privacy protected, and balancing those two issues, is what the Minister is tackling now and I wish him well in his quest.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">I welcome the Minister to the House. In particular, I commend him on his thought provoking and broad-ranging address to the House. It is indicative of the Minister's approach to this issue and I am pleased that he is here to hear our views on it. We sought a debate on a press council and the Minister will forgive me for dwelling on that particular aspect. I suggest that perhaps the Minister is in need of a press council because his own comments here this morning, and the range of commentary on his proposals so far, would suggest that somebody has got the wrong end of the stick. I am sure the Minister has read some of the comments on the issue of the alleged Government-appointed press council he is alleged to be promoting.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Given the extent of press coverage of this issue, particularly in recent weeks, I did a trawl on the Internet to review many of the newspaper comments and reports.

          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_163">—to an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent </i>of 10 October which referred to the Minister's plans for “a Ceaucescu-like press council”. It is important this issue is straightened out because the media are working themselves into a frenzy about the Minister's alleged plans to appoint a statutory press council. In the absence of a press council, I do not know how the Minister will clarify the matter but it is important he does so at the earliest opportunity and I wish him luck.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Speaking as a former journalist, one of the drawbacks of the media is that once they get the wrong end of the stick, they are disinclined to state they are wrong or even clarify the issue in question, which takes me neatly to the importance of a press council. What does the Minister or an ordinary person in the street do if he or she is misreported, misinterpreted or misunderstood and people are given a particular impression through media reports? One can take the matter to the newspapers' customer complaints desks, which are so minimal they border on an insult and are virtually a waste of time, although the media appears to believe they are a great idea. The resistance of the media, particularly the print media, to the establishment of even a self-appointed body is indicative of their basic resistance to any notion that anybody should tell them how to run their affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">In July 1998, I published a proposal to establish a voluntary press council. I am glad to note that the Minister has not given up on the idea of self-regulation. While I, too, have not given up on it, I am rapidly coming to that point, the reason being that the media have talked about it but done nothing. Despite numerous opportunities to establish their own body, they have not done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">It is interesting, particularly in the context of the events of recent weeks, to read that the National Newspapers of Ireland and the National Union of Journalists want an independent body to be established which has legal backing. How can one have a non-statutory body with a statutory arm? This is an inconsistent position and I call on the NUJ, of which I am a member, and the National Newspapers of Ireland to get their thinking straight on this matter and decide exactly what objective they are pursuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">When drawing up my proposal, I explored the issue in some depth and carefully examined the approach taken in other countries. The public, which is losing faith in the media, is one section of the population which does not appear to be given any consideration in this matter. People are conscious of the need for an independent and powerful media which investigates and reports on matters of considerable public interest. I will not even start to list examples of areas in which the media have successfully highlighted matters of considerable public concern. While we rely on the media for information on what is happening, this brings with it a major responsibility in terms of what is reported and, in particular, how it is reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">This is particularly true of murder and crime. After I published my proposal I was approached by the representatives of victims of crime. By raising the actual case of a woman who had been murdered, they made a strong point. The manner in which such a murder is reported causes serious offence to the family. For example, it may be constantly reported both in the print and broadcast media that a naked body has been found in the Dublin Mountains, which causes considerable offence to the victim's family who cannot do anything about it. When, on the anniversary of the murder, a member of the family goes to the newsagents to buy a newspaper, he or she will again see their close relative, their loved one, being written about in these terms, which causes serious hurt.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">In addition, there is clear evidence of a bandwagon effect in the reporting of suicide. While it is correct that the media, particularly the regional media, have taken the issue on board by writing about suicide and its incidence, the manner in which it is reported is also extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">With regard to anorexia, one remembers the Lavinia Kerwick story, at the edges of which was a degree of voyeurism. The case also resulted in dangerous reporting which amounted almost to the glorification of anorexia. At the time, I was informed it was glamourising the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Standards have undoubtedly fallen in terms of racism and stereotyping as well as in the use of photographs of victims of crime, particularly people who have been killed. The reporting of issues such as race, immigration and poverty raises problems as regards stereotyping. In terms of the portrayal of women, one constantly sees photographs in newspapers of what I call men in suits, whereas it is rare to see women in such powerful environments. On the other hand, fashion shows and models are constantly reported in the media. These issues would be worthy of examination by a press council.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">A press council is essential. I hope we can move away from the question of who is appointed to it and get to the nub of the issue, which is whether it should be statutory or non-statutory. As I stated, while I have not given up on self-regulation, I wonder if the relevant bodies are serious about it. How serious can they be if they argue on the one hand for an independent body while, on the other, calling for it to include legal protection? I call on them to sit down and listen to the views of the Minister and others, including Members of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">In establishing a press council, it will be vital to provide a clear mechanism for making complaints. As Senator Maurice Hayes pointed out and as we all know, short of taking a case to court, there is no way to get redress if one's story has been misreported, misinterpreted, misunderstood or one has a complaint to make. I ask the NUJ, the NNI and journalists generally to examine the model of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, a statutory body appointed by the Government which works. There is no sense of political or other interference with the BCC, a body to which people can bring their complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Having worked in RTE, I am aware that if one hears that a complaint has been made to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission about something on which one has worked, the matter is taken seriously on an individual, team and organisational level. There are, therefore, models for a press council. What the public wants is a body which provides decent redress if one takes a complaint to it. Therein lies the need for balance. On the one hand, it must have teeth while, on the other, it cannot operate in a heavy-handed manner which acts as a disincentive for the press to investigate and report.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">The proposal by the legal advisory group on defamation on the grounds for reasonable publication is excellent. It seems to have broad support and is worth pursuing. It is well worth seeing if it can be given some sort of legislative and statutory framework. In that regard, the courts must have a role; otherwise, who will decide what is a reasonable publication?</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The NUJ and the NNI should look carefully at these proposals. They should not respond with a gut reaction but look at the layers of issues that must be considered. The public must be included also in some way. The Minister should consider looking beyond the usual suspects and pillars. In terms of the media, it is not like an economic forum or a political matter. It is a much broader issue. The public needs to have confidence in the media and, in general, it has that confidence, but it is gradually eroding. The influence of British tabloid journalism in this respect has not necessarily been good.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">I know politicians become very sensitive when they are reported or misreported. I know that access to the expenses claims of politicians under the freedom of information provisions, particularly in the local press, has caused a good deal of angst among politicians. However, that is something with which we will have to live. We cannot expect to be treated the same as the ordinary "Joe Soap", walking down the street. We are not like that; we are public representatives in the Oireachtas and our standards have to reflect that position. We leave ourselves open to considerable public scrutiny, but there is an issue of privacy, particularly concerning our families. That is something we have every right to ask to be protected and we should collectively take a stand on that not only to protect ourselves and our families, but also each other. That is not too much to expect. We stand for election, but members of our family do not and their privacy should not be invaded simply because they are unfortunate enough to be related to a politician.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I commend the Minister on his work in this area. He is clearly very committed to it. I am glad we have this opportunity to clarify, at least for ourselves, his thinking on the matter. I support his general view on it and wish him well. Once again, the thinking of bodies which have a clear interest in this matter should be in-depth, responsible and broad. I look forward to a legislative framework coming before the House in the next few months.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_60">
          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_179">I welcome the Minister again. It is becoming a habit. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is a topic involving serious difficulty. I understand why the Minister decided to adopt so much of the advice he received from his consultations, although I heard him being accused of having made up his mind on certain issues. However, it is probably one of the most important pieces of legislation that will pass through the House for some time. I am aware that in taking this on, the Minister is also fulfilling an obligation set out in the Government's programme for 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">I recall, as the Minister mentioned, that in the early 1990s the National Newspapers of Ireland published a draft defamation Bill. Bearing that in mind, it is fair to say that this issue has been hanging around for some time. The Bill was largely based on recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's report. The Minister referred to that aspect and the differences between them, Some of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission have been adopted by the legal advisory group the Minister established. It is very commendable that they are still considered useful tools 11 years on.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">During recent media coverage of the possibility of a press council being established, one could be forgiven for thinking that some journalists and commentators were looking for an absolute right in terms of their responsibilities when giving their views. They argued that freedom of expression should take precedence over every other consideration. In some respects we have seen some of this in recent times in some of the so-called objective reporting. I can recall one incident where I read a newspaper and put it down in total disgust as it was nothing short of character assassination of an individual. The Minister might have been the subject a few weeks later of a similar description, perhaps not as harsh, but equally objectionable.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The idea that society is entitled to a press that should have some standards and act in a reasonable and ethical manner is not a ground-breaking view. Some of those who argue most for a press council will agree with that view. The NUJ, to which Senator O'Meara referred, has a fine code of conduct which requires journalists, among other things, to do nothing which constitutes intrusion into anyone's privacy, unless there is an overriding public reason to do so. However, that code of conduct is probably gathering dust in the NUJ. The media, on the other hand, have no system of self-regulation. If anyone has a legitimate complaint against the press, the only recourse he or she has is right of reply, which will probably find its way onto the back page or the inside back page of the next edition. The only other option is costly litigation, which is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">We need to achieve a balance, where if someone is defamed in an article there will be a way in which he or she can get redress without having to go down a legal road. He or she may not have the money or inclination to go that route. The argument in favour of self-regulation suggested that statutory controls were hostile to press freedom and that self-regulation was the only way the press could preserve its freedom. There is no doubt, as the Minister stated, that press freedom is a very necessary requirement of a democratic society and that it should be recognised that the free exchange of ideas and opinions builds the values that inform society. However, it does not follow that any statutory intervention runs contrary to that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">It should be possible to establish some form of statutory body which would respect the freedom of the press and act in an autonomous way, while providing transparency and independence that would give the public confidence in the entire process. There is no real argument as to why the press and other media should not be treated in the same way as others. Perhaps we could have an all-embracing council which would involve both the print and broadcast media.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">One of the best responses to a defamatory statement is a careful rebuttal. If anyone who makes a defamatory statement is shown to have got his or her facts wrong, he or she will lose credibility when someone responds with a hard and fast rebuttal. However, a rebuttal only works if the person is working off the same hymn sheet and he or she has the same capacity as the individual who broadcast or printed the statement in the first place. As very few people own television stations or newspapers, it is very difficult to take on the mass media. In that respect, free speech is not worth very much when one is up against the power of the media. There have been cases where people's reputations have been destroyed by media attacks. I do not know if the defamation laws are a satisfactory remedy in that regard. I do not think the person who sues for defamation manages, certainly in the short or medium term, to restore his or her good name. Most media organisations will defend and pay rather than accept they were wrong. As they have the money and the power, the individual is wasting his or her time in taking them on. This is an important issue and one on which the Minister has my blessing. There will probably be much more discussion and thought put into the process before we see the Minister in the House again with legislation on this matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_188">This has been an interesting debate. We do not often have debates in which Lincoln and Jefferson as well as Dr. Con Lucey of Cork are quoted. This is a topic about which I do not know a great deal, although I have been involved in one incident in which, when being quoted in <i>The Irish News</i> in Belfast in 1968, I was referred to as a well known IRA man. I was very upset that I had been mistaken for somebody with a similar name who was prominent 50 years earlier. I got in touch with the newspaper by telephone, but I was even more upset with the correction, which stated that not only was I not an IRA man but my pro-Unionist loyalties were strong. I almost felt like taking a defamation case from the other side.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The words I have prepared for this debate do not show much sympathy for the delay that has occurred on this matter over the years. In a debate in this House on the same subject more than three and a half years ago – on 10 May 2000 – I said we should be embarrassed by our lack of up-to-date libel legislation. Now the word I would use is ashamed, because the amount of foot-dragging that has taken place beggars belief. I understand the Minister's views and I know he is taking steps to rectify matters. Governments often make promises on which they are slow to deliver – there is nothing new in that. There is something particularly repugnant, however, in foot-dragging of this kind when it is so clearly motivated by self-interest. For well over a decade, since the Law Reform Commission made its proposals in 1991, successive Governments of all shapes and hues have consistently refused to grasp the nettle. The Minister is now grasping it and we should see in January how well he is able to handle these matters. It is not easy.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">This is a technical matter of interest only to lawyers. The absence of a proper system of libel law directly undermines the principle of freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution, as the Minister said earlier. We have had ample evidence over the past decade of the impact of the current set-up on our political system. Effectively, it is a way of muzzling the press, of heading off inquiries into matters that many would prefer were left unexamined. It is a way of sweeping unpleasant matters under the carpet and ensuring they are kept there. Nobody could argue that our public life has not suffered as a result of this muzzling.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Of course, the press are not plaster saints – I would not suggest that for a moment. Like the rest of us, they often make mistakes. They cut corners under pressure of deadlines or the fear of being beaten to a story by a competitor. Five or six years ago, around this time of the year, one radio station carried a story that the turkeys in a certain supermarket chain – not the one with which I am associated – had been poisoned. This was broadcast at 10.30 a.m. on the basis of a telephone call received at 10 a.m. and could have caused much damage. I visited newspaper editors and other figures in the media to ask them to act in a more realistic manner. Just one telephone call can do much damage. I could understand their sympathy with my position, but they also said that with radio stations and so on competing so actively, if there is a delay of half an hour listeners will become convinced they always hear the stories first somewhere else. I understand the competitive nature of the business and why people act the way they do. I am not talking about defamatory statements or libel only, but about the damage that can be done generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The media are increasingly ready to blur the distinction between what the public is interested in and what it actually needs to know. There must be an effective system of regulation of the media to accompany any new laws. Nobody is suggesting the media be given the freedom to do what they like in an unbridled fashion, but these matters are not excuses for doing nothing. Nothing excuses the extent of the foot-dragging that has been going on since 1991.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The excuse for the delay centres on an argument about the form to be taken by any regulation of the media. The media have consistently and strenuously objected to the form of statutory regulation the Government appears to favour, although having heard the Minister today I am not so sure, namely the commission or press council whose members would be appointed largely by the Government itself. I understand their reservations, but I cannot help feeling they are becoming unduly hung up on this issue. Nor can I help feeling that it has suited various Governments in the past, as it has suited every Government for the past ten years, to drag this issue out for as long as they possibly could. Even a press council, a regulated body appointed by the Government, would be much better than the unreconstructed libel laws in place at the moment. In opposing the kind of regulation that is proposed, the media may be looking for the best when they should be prepared to settle for what is good.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I have said many times there is a gap between the way we talk, as legislators, and the way we act. We are, for example, in the habit of frequently deploring the low regard in which the political process in general is held and the low regard for politicians in particular. While we go on talking, however, we are slow to do the very things that would help to rebuild public confidence and trust in the political process. I associate the libel and defamation issue with the political process because it is closely tied to political matters. Most of the people who have sued in the past have been politicians. Again and again we hear that journalists and newspapers have been gagged by the threat of libel action, either through direct threats from those affected or by their own legal advisers. We are told that some of the revelations now being made at the Mahon tribunal could have been in the public domain much earlier had it not been for the actual or feared threat of libel.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">As long as we continue to drag our feet on this issue we deepen people's cynicism about our sincerity, yet at the same time we wish to make public life more transparent and to be more answerable to the people. What do the ordinary people think when they consider our failure to grasp the nettle of defamation and libel laws? They simply see it as a matter of politicians looking after themselves and their own interests. They see it as a defensive gesture by people and institutions that seem to have something to hide. We may argue against that, but I am talking about how the public views matters. The plain people of Ireland are not impressed by yet another Seanad session devoted to statements on defamation. What they want to see is a Bill on the subject, which will grab hold of the issue and drag our political processes into the 21st century.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">This is the one question that should emerge from this debate: When will we see the long-awaited Bill to deal with libel? We have had the report of the Commission on Law Reform, endless other internal reports and interminable discussions, including debates such as this. The Minister has clearly been trying to get to grips with this matter in recent weeks and it has been interesting to see him place it high on his agenda. I hope we will now do something about it. I look forward to next month when the Minister, after listening carefully to the debate, goes about placing a law on the Statute Book.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Quinn, for sharing his time with me. I am glad to be able to speak on this debate. I would have been here earlier, but I was in court – as a witness, I am glad to say, not as an accused person. However, I am in the curious situation of being enmeshed in two libel cases, one as the plaintiff and the other as the defendant. It is regrettable that I cannot talk about either case, because I would like to talk about both. Perhaps there will be an opportunity when the Minister introduces his Bill to speak about both because at that stage they will be in the past and not <i>sub judice. </i>I make no bones about my antagonism to the position taken up by newspaper editors. They talk about inhibiting publication, but what inhibits publication is their utter lack of fibre. There were plenty of articles they could have printed but they would not take the risk. There were articles in the past that they should have printed. They use the libel laws as an alibi for their utter gutlessness. This applies not only to newspaper people but to publishers and booksellers. I remember when one could not get Frank McDonald's book on Dublin in most of the major distributors because people were afraid of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">I do not believe newspapers are particularly inhibited. Let us look at some of the other institutions. I recall a journalist was forced to produce a grovelling retraction of an article he had written about a former Taoiseach and his relationships with a bank and the way it had forgiven certain substantial loans. The bank denied it. The unfortunate journalist had to retract and grovel and now it has been revealed that the bank was lying through its teeth. That is an appalling indictment of such institutions. However uncomfortable it may be, it is important for individuals and institutions to tell the truth in these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">It is important that the individual is protected against the might of newspapers. For example, if one looks at mass circulation, the damage that can be done to a person is severe in terms of his or her reputation and standing with his or her neighbours, friends and so on. The newspapers have resources to fight these cases if they wish. I do not accept for one moment the notion that there should be a significantly lower burden of proof required for somebody in public life. Why should there be a lower burden of proof? I have a very simple principle – print the truth or pay the price. I would like that enshrined in the legislation being brought forward. Should they be allowed print lies and get away with it because somebody is in a position in public life? There is also the notion that items are published because it is in the public interest and the public has a right to know. Does the public have the right to know that the Queen has a plastic toaster? What public interest does that serve? It is of no public interest whatsoever. It is major intrusiveness and, as far as I am concerned, it is intolerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">There is a concentration of power in the hands of newspaper moguls, such as Rupert Murdoch. Luckily, our local variant, Sir Anthony O'Reilly, is a reasonably decent man, but that is an accident. He could easily have been a twin of Rupert Murdoch. If that was the case, where would we be?</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Regarding the hypocrisy of the newspapers, I laugh at the squawks that come from every newspaper in the State about how they are battered into a corner and it would be appalling for the Government to appoint people or for anybody but themselves to regulate the newspaper industry. Are these not the same newspapers that lectured every other profession, including the Garda Síochána, lawyers and others, about the need for independent examination and that everybody must be seen to be objective, open, transparent and accountable – all except the newspapers? They say they will regulate themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Let us look across the water at the neighbouring island and see what happened there when the newspapers regulated themselves. <i>The Sun</i> prints lies regularly, including an article about Elton John which stated he was at a party with rent boys and drug boys. He was not even in the country. He got damages of £1 million. The newspaper's circulation increased enormously because his name was on the front page. <i>The Sun</i> was delighted and was probably able to trouser about £500,000. We need to ensure the individual is protected in such situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I accept there are matters of public interest and they should be ventilated. It is appropriate that this happens. We are all relatively tough and seasoned in these matters and most of us are prepared to take a reasonable level of criticism on the jaw. What constitutes a public figure? Is a public figure just a politician? Is it permissible to have a lower standard of proof against politicians alone or lawyers, doctors or judges? What happens if somebody says something about a judge? There are complications there, but I had better not dwell on that area. I have just realised I should avoid that one, but I look forward to returning to it at a subsequent date.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">It is important to look at the libel laws. Matters of public interest should be ventilated, but there is a real duty to protect the ordinary citizen. People who are accused, in particular, of rather nasty sexual crimes often have, as a matter of practice, their names, addresses and occupations printed in newspapers and they may be found not guilty. What happens then? That man or woman's reputation is destroyed forever. It should not be legal to print the name of an accused person until he or she is convicted because the printing of the name is part of the punishment. The argument is that it should be held in public. It is held in public in a public court. Those closest to it and those who have a real interest can be present in the court as is their entitlement. In my opinion, newspapers are not entitled to destroy the reputation of a person who is held and presumed to be innocent until he or she is found guilty. The newspapers do it every day of the week. I have even seen such articles accompanied by photographs. What is the redress for those who are innocent and have been so found by the courts? Their reputations have been destroyed by such matters being published in this manner. I ask the Minister to examine this matter.</p>

          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_205">Tá fáilte roimh an Aire. In the main politicians can take the blame for the excesses which have happened in the media. They have viewed the media as the conduit to electoral success and, therefore, have abdicated their responsibility when opportunities arose to stand up to what was happening in the media over the past 40 or 50 years. I recall on one occasion the late President Childers called for balance when reporting good and bad news. Needless to say, that was in the more innocent days. We are particularly fortunate that, in regard to the anti-social behaviour where the abuse of alcohol is concerned, particularly as we saw it portrayed on "Prime Time", the Minister was prepared to take a stand and do something radical because he knew it was for the general good. In this case he has facilitated the debate. However, I can pick up newspapers and find various columnists trying to demonise the Minister not because he will ban the media or confiscate their assets, but simply because he is facilitating a debate. A halo would be much more appropriate than a pair of horns in this case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_66">

          <p eId="para_206">Lord, deliver us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LabhrasOMurchu" eId="spk_67">
          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_207">At the end of the day we have to take a stand because it is for the good of the media. I listened to "Tonight with Vincent Browne" the other night. I give Vincent Browne full marks because he did an excellent job. Considering that he is an element of the media, he tackled those who endeavoured to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, go softly softly or in some way ensure confusion would ensue from the debate. He asked a media representative if it is right to run with a story for which there is no concrete evidence and there is a danger to the subject of the story. The representative replied that it is. Vincent Browne asked what the victim could do about it. He replied that he would have the usual redress. What is the usual redress, to go to the High Court with every possibility of being unable to pay the costs? That is not redress. That a media spokesman made such a statement shows how far down the ladder of priorities facts are for certain elements of the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I have often said that I have the height of admiration for the vast majority of journalists but Members know I have indicated cases I would not accept again and again. There was a terrible family tragedy in Kilkenny and before the funeral had taken place, the media were already discussing domestic squabbles within that family. Can anyone imagine how the bereaved must have felt when they should have been allowed to grieve? They had done no wrong to anyone else but these journalists felt that was acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">A short time later the NUJ wrote to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to complain about me and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges circulated the letter to all Senators. The media are good at dealing it out but are no good at taking it when they are criticised but in this case they had picked the wrong target. When I checked the Official Report they had attributed remarks to me that were made by someone else. I received a grovelling apology, the secretary of the NUJ came in and said he was sorry. I accepted that in a gracious manner but I also asked why he was so paranoid that he would not let such a small point be debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The newspapers will not cover this debate, that is the power they have. If we were discussing excesses in political life, however, there would be many juicy headlines in the newspapers tomorrow. They have the power to destroy people's character and it is important that the NUJ takes a stand and endeavours to maintain the ethics of the profession. The media had the opportunity to be self regulating but never took it. As a result of the excessive competition in the media, particularly the tabloid influence we have imported and which has become the hallmark of some sections of the media, we need statutory regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">We cannot generalise about the media. Provincial newspapers are doing an excellent job and write in a balanced way. Their editorials could be held up as examples of the quality of life that exists in this country. The local radio stations are open to anyone who wants to make his case and the standards are exceptionally high. The mainstream newspapers are, by and large, doing a good job, although they have taken a small step over the boundary and must pull back. It is fine to say this is what the public wants but if the public is fed a particular diet, how will it be weaned off it unless positive action is taken? The public does not want the sensational all the time, there is a discerning readership and viewership and these people want balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">How many times have we read a newspaper headline then looked for substantive content under that headline only to find none, particularly in an evening newspaper like the <i>Evening Herald</i>? People pick it up at a railway station thinking there is a story in it but below the headline there is no substance. There is one reason only for the headline, to sell the newspaper. When the Kildare bypass was opened, I used it that night. When travelling on it, I thought of the wonderful progress we had made. I picked up the <i>Irish Independent</i> the next day and it did not mention the good side of the bypass, only the build up of traffic in Monasterevin.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">It is the same negative story all the time and if that diet is fed to people, that is what they expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The Minister must maintain his courage on this issue. I listened to his speech this morning; it was balanced with no question of teaching the media a lesson. It recognised this is a matter of our being elements of the same community with an interest in its future. That is the reason for this debate, it is not about politicians getting their own back. There are black sheep and they should be exposed and penalised but the manner in which the media has done this and has focused on all political life has done immense damage to the body politic of the State. Crime is excessive because respect for authority no longer exists. People in this House have criticised the gardaí, the church and politicians. If they have specific examples, that is fine, but generalisation does not make a contribution to the quality of life in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I address my remarks to editors because they are in control. Many journalists leave their editor's office with instructions to bring back a sensational story. They are not asked to report the facts as they stand and in many cases they are told what headline is needed. A friend of mine, a reporter for whom I had great regard, covered an event. I remarked to him that we were lucky that he was reporting on the matter because he knew all about it. He told me that when he left Dublin that morning, his editor instructed him to send back a sensational headline and story. Does that mean that the story is written before the event? In such a culture we must enter into partnership with the media and get its representatives to understand that the legislation we are calling for is in their interest as well as ours.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The credibility gap between the media and public will grow and the media would do well to heed that instead of making outrageous assertions on "Tonight with Vincent Browne" that an innocent person can be demonised and the only opportunity of redress for him is to go to the High Court with the resultant costs and further publicity. That is not right and we must get back to reality. I am confident that we have the right Minister to see this through and it must be done as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_218">I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome the debate as a preamble to legislation. Until Senator Ó Murchú's contribution, I thought the Minister was open to consultation. Then I heard Senator Ó Murchú's comments about a culture in which newspaper editors send reporters out to get a story at all costs and to bring back a sensational one, probably written before arrival at their destination. That is grossly unfair to the many competent reporters and journalists working in our media. It is clear from much of Senator Ó Murchú's contribution that he believes it necessary to control the media somehow. The Minister seemed to be sitting on the fence regarding a statutory or self-regulatory press council. He did not declare to us today which way he was going. Senator Ó Murchú criticised the print media for its reporting of the recently opened Kildare bypass because it noted that a wonderful section of new roadway provided by public funds would only move the gridlock further down the road to Monasterevin, which is a fact. If the Senator cannot take that he is relying on spin and has obviously fattened on it for years.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">How quickly the situation changes, in May 2002 the editor of Sir Anthony's newspaper, the <i>Irish Independent </i> wrote that it was pay-back time.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_223">There is an important task to be done and that is a very serious responsibility for the Minister who must bring clarity to the situation. At the symposium on freedom of expression last week in Trinity College he noted that "growing attention was being paid to the right of freedom of expression and the responsibilities that flow from the exercise of that right." That is a very important statement. He also said that "In a democracy government is accountable to the people." Why was it necessary for him a few months ago to deny and curtail that accountability by revising the Freedom of Information Act 1997 in a serious and restrictive way? His statement this morning is not reconcilable with his past actions. I cannot take as bona fide the sincerity of the consultation process on which he says he is embarking because his actions always speak louder than his words. Why can he not let us see the accountability he mentioned this morning at work? Why does it have to be hidden and restricted? It is important that we have clarity and that all the arguments about preventing violation of matters relevant to the North of Ireland or to security within the State are put to one side.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Can the Minister tell the Cabinet that he is going to appoint apolitical people to the statutory press council who will represent the public, the media, and many other interested groups? That would be the right way to do it, and return with legislation clearly indicating that everything is above board. This Government does not have the capacity for that because over the years it has tried to manipulate sections of the media. Thankfully there were those within the media who resisted any endeavours to make them toe the Government line. This discussion will be important if we can get the Minister to say that if there is to be a press council there will be no interference from Government and that may be the best way to go. The media do not want sensationalism all the time. It is true that profit is important to the media and that they have to run a business but we cannot forget the many people who have given a lifetime to journalism and who were the epitome of honesty and presented information in a truthful way. Anyone who tries to retract from that is doing so to protect his or her own interests.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I will only touch on the media because I want to take a wider view of defamation and deal with subjects not much discussed here this morning. The Minister made an important distinction in his speech between a press council that had some teeth, or that would not be toothless, and the separate question of how it would be composed. As Senator O'Meara rightly pointed out, we have for some years had the Broadcasting Complaints Commission which is an independent statutory body whose members are appointed by the Government. This does not appear to have inhibited in any way RTE's style. Senator Quinn made the point that restrictiveness of libel laws in the past prevented people going into areas that it would have been in the public interest to have opened up. That may be so. There was a more authoritarian culture in the past. The social culture has changed. Equally under current laws there was a story that went to court which falsely accused the Taoiseach of accepting a large sum of money in a car park. It is not always easy to strike the right balance. It is much too simple merely to say that the current position is much too restrictive. We are not a good profession to accuse the media of sensationalising, exaggerating and being less than objective. We are not over guilty of understating our own case. A newspaper accused the Minister of having Ceaucescu-type intentions. That was a comparison made by the Minister in the run up to the last general election which, admittedly, he brought into the public arena.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I was interested in Senator Jim Walsh's remarks about the power of the media because we might not be the only ones to ask ourselves questions in that regard. As the House is aware, I took up a part-time career as a columnist recently and on the steps outside the office of the newspaper for which I write, a journalist said to me, "Welcome to the real establishment".</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I want to move from the issue of the media, which has been well aired in this debate, to two separate issues. A few weeks ago, I called to a retired person, at his request. His wife was with him and he was in a terrible state. He emigrated to Britain in the 1950s, spent 20 years there where he held positions of great trust and responsibility in the public sector, came home, started a business and found – I am merely telling his story, I am not judging the merits of it one way or the other – he was accused of abusing the daughters of a brother-in-law. I gather that on separate occasions his two brothers were accused likewise. His position is that these accusations are false and he has allowed the law to take due course, whereas I think his brothers may have made some kind of financial settlement. I cannot possibly say what the exact position is, having heard only one side of the story, but the point I want to make is that there are certain types of accusations and allegations – they have been mentioned in the context of clerical sex abuse by Senator Ó Murchú on previous occasions – where the accusation is so terrible that there is an automatic, almost Pavlovian reaction, that if such an accusation is made it must be true, yet there is potential money involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Terrible things have happened, which are being exposed, and I am not taking issue with any of that. It must be worked through and the difficulties in society faced, but it is nonetheless the case that, even if it concerns only perhaps a small minority, there is a temptation to look for compensation or to threaten somebody that unless a sum of money is paid, the person making the threat will go public or make charges. If a person is taken into custody for a brief period, that person may be treated badly on the basis of the allegation alone because people assume that if such an allegation is made, it must be true. All of this relates to defamation. We need to be extraordinarily careful and realise that the climate creates some temptations and that we must find a way of separating the wheat from the chaff. The law should take a serious view of people who make accusations which, as has been said, destroy people's reputations, even probably if they manage to clear themselves of such false accusations.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Another area which perhaps needs further study by the Law Reform Commission or some other body is the question of defamation of the recently dead. I hope the Minister will not dismiss this point out of hand until I develop my thoughts on it. One cannot damage in a financial sense someone who is dead. I am not talking about damages but a person's reputation can be very precious, particularly to one's nearest and dearest, including one's brothers, sisters, children and, as applies to a few cases, parents and close relatives. We need a system whereby the reputation of a person who is recently dead can be cleared. It would have to be carefully drawn up. I refer to where malicious, false accusations and allegations – I am not talking about value judgments which is a different issue – are made with impunity against a person. What I have in mind is not that one would be able to seek damages as such, but that one would be able to seek the clearance of such a person's name and questions of legal cost might arise. There would be no pecuniary interest for the person making the complaint, but there could be some pecuniary cost in the sense of legal fees. This matter is worthy of consideration. I accept it would need to be looked at carefully and would not be easy to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The purpose of a press council, although one would not believe it having regard to some of the comments about it, presumably, is to provide an alternative to law courts where people can get redress without having to incur vast legal expense. That ought to be in the interest of the media as much as the individual. Most private individuals, no more than politicians, do not want to go to court. I have a strong view, although different people for whom I have worked would have a different view on this matter, that politicians should almost never go to the law courts unless they are accused of something of a personal and disgraceful nature. I am thinking of what Daniel O'Connell would have done a few hundred years ago; he would undoubtedly have challenged the editor to a duel.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_233">I thank the Members of the House for what has been another broad ranging and stimulating debate. On this matter, I feel somewhat like a pendulum. I found myself swinging this way and that when listening to the various contributions. I wonder does this show some lack of political substance on my part or is it merely that the power of rhetoric is very strong. I was attracted by some of the remarks of Senator Norris, but I must be careful about this because I cannot endorse them without qualification. What I found attractive about his contribution was that he was pricking a few balloons, which must always be done on this subject. Regarding the contributions by Senators Ulick Burke, Ó Murchú and Mansergh, we sometimes have to prick our own balloons, because the Ceaucescu reference by Senator O'Meara was well made. It hit in various directions and of course in the end the ball bounced off me.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">In politics, one must be reasonably robust. I thank Senator Ó Murchú for his remarks in that regard. One has to have broad shoulders and a fairly thick skin. As Senator Mansergh said, people in politics should be slow to litigate when they have grievances with the media, especially since politics and the media have a sort of symbiotic relationship similar to a herd of wildebeest being stalked by a pack of hyenas. The relationship is an unsteady one. We know that when we are weak and falter, we will be devoured. That is perhaps not such a bad thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Recalling the remark of Thomas Jefferson quoted at the outset of the debate, about the choice between a society with a government and no newspapers and a society with newspapers and no government, with Jefferson opting for the latter, that choice is not available. A democracy could not exist without the media. If our media were to close down tomorrow, our democracy would cease to function. A few well intentioned people might attempt to sustain standards unilaterally, but in the absence of the countervailing influence of the media, elected democracies would not function. Standards would collapse and the few remaining statesmen or stateswomen would find their standards quickly swept away by having to survive in the company of people who would do anything as long as there was no glare of publicity on their activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">We must be balanced in all of this. The relationship between politicians and the media is ambivalent and ambiguous. We must also distinguish between the instincts of Opposition politicians and Government politicians. The latter get huffy and defensive about the media taking them on. Opposition politicians go in the other direction and get into lick mode with the media. That is the way it works. Some people on the Government side of the House this afternoon have tended to be critical of the media in a defensive way. That is to be expected. Others on the Opposition benches have made remarks which were unduly uncritical of the media. If one could extract from the broad range of views expressed today some kind of centre position, that would probably be right.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Standards in journalism are important. The standards of the great majority of journalists are good. Most of the journalists and editors I meet are trying to do their best. There is no doubt about that. I fully endorse what Senator Ó Murchú said about what used to be called the regional media, including regional radio. They have set very high standards. One does not hear massive complaints about lack of fairness or balance there. This is interesting. The regional media give a fair crack of the whip to both sides of the political debate. Even if they have a prejudice they tend to be reasonably restrained in the way in which they allow that prejudice to show itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Senator Ulick Burke mentioned the FOI Act. I make no apology for saying that the Freedom of Information Act originally in place had gone too far in the wrong direction and needed to be corrected. In matters governmental, transparency is not necessarily a good thing. I know that remark will probably attract some obloquy in the fullness of time, but there must be privacy. It must be the case that if a Minister for Finance is proposing something with which I radically disagree, I am entitled not merely to say so orally at a Cabinet meeting, but to send him a memorandum strongly opposing his suggestion. That applies right through my Department. If I ask my civil servants in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to prepare a position to oppose some proposition coming from another Minister, that entire process should take place privately. If it does not, then either the comment or analysis is neutered because it will be in the media within a couple of weeks, or else the response is confined to yellow Post-Its or to paper which is shredded, or written on the backs of envelopes. That is completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Among Departments and Ministers, for example, the very essence of democratic government is that one is entitled to elaborate on and develop one's case in privacy, because one is leading to a Cabinet discussion and decision which will take place in private. I make no apologies for the protections which were introduced regarding the deliberative process. They were necessary. I have already said in public that the stance taken by the former Ombudsman in this matter was unduly aggressive in trying to tear down that kind of privacy, so much so that where we had a clearly established routine whereby political parties could ask the Department of Finance to cost their political proposals on budgetary matters with a view to improving the degree of responsibility that attaches to the democratic process, and whereby people could present a tax strategy which they wanted assessed in the context of an election, that was to be done in private. Could anything be more sensible or more high-minded than that public servants would conduct that service in private even for Opposition Deputies? Could anything be more wrong-minded than to imagine that the Freedom of Information Act required or could even create a situation where one party could then apply to find out what another party had been up to in terms of costing proposals? Could anything have been more wrong-minded or muddled than to think the public interest would be served by this? Nevertheless that much-decried Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill had to protect this aspect of privacy from aggressive implementation of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">What have we got now? The deliberative process is to be thrown open to the public gaze after ten years, whereas the figure in the neighbouring jurisdiction is 30 years. We are then told that some terrible fascist, oppressive, regressive legislation was imposed on the Irish people.</p>

We are entitled to generate our proposals in private. We are entitled to come up with foolish ideas and then spike them. We are entitled to put trenchant views against each other's positions coming up to a Cabinet decision and if we want to remain in Government, we are then obliged to go out and defend the majority decision taken at a Cabinet meeting.

The deliberative process must be protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I have held two public offices in this State, that of Attorney General and that of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In one of those offices, the Freedom of Information Act did not apply, except to the general management of the office. In the other it did, in an uncontrolled way prior to the amendment of the law. I have no doubt that one of the consequences of the Freedom of Information Act is that genuinely held opinions and advice were not committed to paper in the latter office where they were in the former office. When all the dust settles and the historians look at files, they will find nothing of the deliberative process in many of the offices which were subjected to the glaring and withering blast of Freedom of Information whereas they will find nuggets as to what was really happening in those areas of Government which were clear of that process.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_249">I accept that is a point. I acknowledge that people who are critical of the media should always remember that spin and leaks are the other side of the coin. Senator Mansergh put this point more pithily than I but I accept that proposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I said earlier that one must be robust with the media. The media are better at giving it than taking it. They order ink by the barrel-load and those who take them on do so at their peril. If one criticises the media, the jaded cliché that one is killing the messenger will be flung back at one. Until this debate was launched there had not been a significant debate on this issue. One of the advantages of the current debate, in this House and in other places, is that some journalists are beginning to accept that there is a standards issue, others are beginning to accept that there is a control issue and others are asking how toothless a press council would be without a statutory basis. People are beginning to distinguish between a Government appointed press council on the one hand, which the advisory group suggested, and a more organic model, which would be more independent of Government, on the other. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission operates in the context of a licensed media and might not be a perfect model for a press council.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Journalism is the lifeblood of our democracy but campaigning journalism can sometimes become self-indulgent, as I have found out to my cost. I have had the experience of being so heavily attacked that I felt as if I had been to a cocktail party and had a drunk vomit all over me. It was very unpleasant to be on the receiving end but I knew that in the fullness of time, the perpetrator would be more ashamed when he looked back over what he had written than I would be. It was, nonetheless, unpleasant at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">There are some current issues which newspapers could tackle. One newspaper has an errors and corrections section. It is in very small print but it is a step forward. In all my years' practice of libel law I never saw a newspaper willing to be fair with an apology. They always wanted to minimise it, reduce it, take any sense of belief out of it and to make it as gnarled and as unpleasant for the plaintiff as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Sometimes – I will not identify the newspaper concerned – when I wondered at some of the stories printed about me, I asked the press officer in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to contact the person whose name appeared on the byline of the story to say it was not true. I received the response that the journalist did not exist but was a name of convenience used by three journalists, on occasion, as a byline. Are the National Union of Journalists and the National Newspapers of Ireland willing to put up with the pretence that people exist and have written stories when, in fact, the name is completely imaginary or chosen from a telephone book? If that is ethical journalism, I do not know what matters are coming to.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">It was wholly wrong that Deputy Ciarán Cuffe, who moved his share portfolio from oil shares to other shares and bought into a company that manufactures condoms, should see a newspaper headline which read, "TD linked to porn site". I agree with the Members on both sides who pointed out that headlines frequently bear no relationship to the reality. One of the most unfair aspects of journalism is that perfectly sensible stories are given wholly unfair and damaging headlines in order to attract readership, particularly, as Senator Ó Murchú mentioned, when the headline is placed on the front page in order to persuade people to lift up the newspaper. If there is any degree of integrity in a newspaper, its headlines should fairly reflect what is to be read in a story.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I am not on a media bash. Democratic politics and an active set of newspaper and broadcasting institutions have a symbiotic relationship. One cannot survive without the other. There would be no journalism if we did not have a democratic system of government and there would be no democratic system of government if we did not have active journalists. They are two sides of one coin and anyone who thinks one can split the coin or bend it is foolish. I labour under no illusions in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Some people queried whether I am foot dragging on this issue. I am not. The last three to five months have been useful in flushing out people and requiring people to stand up their views. Even if I do not agree with everything in the expert group's report – it is not my opinion but the group's opinion which is contained therein, particularly regarding a press council – I believe it has done the State a magnificent service by flushing out people and forcing them to address issues which they had only half thought through. Today's proceedings will play a significant part in bringing that matter forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">I am deeply grateful to Senators for this opportunity to address them and for all the thoughtful contributions made to today's proceedings.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_258">Fine Gael did not table any amendments to this legislation as it is a straightforward Bill. I wish to raise the question of the infrastructural needs and deficits of the west coast and west Donegal. The Irish word for infrastructure is infreastruchtúr. As a learner of Irish at beginner level, I have been told that there is a better Irish equivalent word – I believe the word is buneagraíocht. Gael Taca has been in contact with me and its mission is to avoid the use of Béarlachas in Irish and the over-use of English words. That word for infrastructure is perhaps a direct translation, but I am nit-picking.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">With regard to the infrastructure in west Donegal, it is very important that the island communities are given these services under the Bill. The Minister is well aware of the infrastructural and community needs. This morning on the Order of Business I welcomed the rural-social scheme the Minister is hoping to devise for farmers. The Minister has covered much ground in terms of providing funds for these projects, but I hope he keeps his eye on the ball with regard to infrastructural deficits and the road network which leads to the islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Gael Taca has also brought the matter of signage to my attention. It wants to see the use of equal sized font for the two languages. I am aware that the Minister is an advocate of such equality. At present the Irish language version of road signs is sometimes in italic script and I suggest the same font should be used for both languages to give them equal status. I am aware that I have digressed from the subject of the Bill, but I wanted to mention those issues to the Minister. My party welcomes the Bill and it tabled amendments in the other House.</p>

A number of years ago in his previous capacity as a Minister of State, he attended a meeting of the western roads committee of Cork County Council in the courthouse in Skibbereen. For some time we had been trying to obtain funding for a road in the Gaeltacht area of Ballingeary. It was not forthcoming and the issue was a hot potato in the local elections of 1999. Funding was made available for what is now a very fine section of road in Ballingeary. It is very important to look at these areas. That initiative brought about a better piece of infrastructure and a better quality of life for the people of those areas. I will let the Minister know about the benefits of the scheme after the local elections campaign next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">I thank Senators for their co-operation in bringing this Bill forward and passing it in the House. One of the issues involved was a matter that was <i>ultra vires</i> and which the Bill will regularise.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">With regard to infrastructure, it should be recognised that there have been significant improvements. My view is that one of the problems was that infrastructure was always built from the centre outwards. When I was given funding for road infrastructure in the Gaeltacht areas, I tended to start at the farthest area back, for example, starting at Glencolumcille and working outwards, rather than starting at the Gaeltacht border and working inwards. I had three reasons for that approach. I felt that if anything ever happened, it was much more likely that the outside portion would be finished whereas if the road was built half way to the Gaeltacht, someone might say that was far enough as the population is so small. I always thought it a ridiculous reason, particularly in the case of a stop-end road, that if the road was built inwards, one is driving over the road and destroying the work that has been done. If one works outwards, there is the advantage of working towards the sources of stone and chips. The third reason was that it sends a signal to people that peripherality can be dealt with if the investment is provided. Between the Gaeltacht and the islands particularly, but more recently for wider rural development, considerable extra funding has been made available. I am very jealous about one thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">When I receive CLÁR, Gaeltacht and Island funding, I am careful to ensure additionality rather than displacement. In the past, when a special fund was established, the money went in but those who should have been doing the job said, "That is very handy, this new fund will look after that", and they tended quietly to pull the money out of the area. I have had many a row with agencies to ensure that the extra funding we provide is additional.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">When modest additional funding is provided, it has a significant effect. One example in County Donegal is that when we received the Gaeltacht funding I arrived at an arrangement with the county manager that he would concentrate on the road from Gweedore to Letterkenny, while we would concentrate on the road from Glencolmcille to Kilcar. In that way two roads were being done relatively quickly with considerable sums of money, whereas if the county council had to split the money between both roads the effect would not have been the same. It is important to keep fighting the good fight for rural infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I am glad Senator McCarthy mentioned Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh. When I was 12 years old I won a prize for taking 40 minutes to run from Gouganbarra to the Irish college in Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh.</p>

          <p eId="para_270">I would not do it at all now. I would have to find some other way of doing it. I do not wish to bore Senators, but all languages have words and phrases that are borrowed from other languages. For example, in Irish we use the words buneagar, bunstruchtúr and infreastruchtúr. We should be relatively careful in decrying such borrowing because words like café and rapporteur are now considered part of the English language and we use them all the time. We are always borrowing words from one language and using them in another. We do not want Irish to be swamped by borrowed words but all languages are made up of such words. An interesting example is the word athair or father. Apparently the Celts could not pronounce the letter "p" and, as a result, pater became athair. That word is a borrowing in itself so borrowing from Latin and other languages did not begin today or yesterday. While we should be careful, it is a question of balance. Sauna is a Finnish word and there are plenty of other examples, even in English.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Broadband is of vital importance and it will either become the great divider or, if we can get it into rural areas, the great leveller. The CLÁR programme is geared towards the increased provision of wireless and other types of broadband. Most parts of the country now have fibre optic cables underground, including Mayo and Donegal. The other big objective is to get this fibre lit and accessible to the public. The Government is committed to doing so.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_274">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_275">That Seanad Éireann, noting that, since it took office, this Government has:</p>
          <p eId="para_276">– abolished the first time buyer's grant;</p>
          <p eId="para_277">– raised VAT on house purchases;</p>
          <p eId="para_278">– presided over a tripling in the price of houses;</p>
          <p eId="para_279">– and allowed the numbers awaiting local authority housing to rise to 52,000 households, comprising over 100,000 individuals</p>
          <p eId="para_280">condemns the failure of the Government to adequately fund local government which forces local authorities to set punitively high development levies which will result in higher prices for new homes, hinder the development of new business and damage the competitiveness of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">We have tabled this motion this evening out of frustration at a system which shamelessly and relentlessly targets the less well-off in our society. Rising house prices and the increasing lack of affordability of both rented and owner-occupied houses threatens general economic growth. A lack of affordable housing also detracts from the quality of life of people on modest or low incomes and on those with special housing needs, such as older people and people with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">There is clearly a need for a strong housing policy response to the current housing problem. In a binge of outrageous pre-election spending in 2001, the Government blatantly squandered the riches of the Celtic tiger years in an orgy of excess and is now squandering the trust of the taxpayer and bolstering the haves at the expense of the have nots. Robin Hood may have robbed the rich to feed the poor but what will future generations say about this Government, which will go down in history as having repeatedly leaned on the less well-off to make up for its financial ineptitude? House buyers who have already lost the first-time buyer's grant are now facing punitive development levies which will see many priced out of the housing market, driving housing lists to even higher levels and forcing more people to become homeless.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">This Government is nothing if not consistent. Stealth taxes, the supposedly hidden enemy of all beleaguered taxpayers, are now being followed by new development levies which are, in effect, the return of property tax by the back door. If the Government had its way, more people would find themselves unable to buy a back door, let alone a complete house. These levies will be the final nail in the coffin for house purchasers.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Currently, the Exchequer siphons off 41% of the purchase price of every new house sold. That amounts to nothing more than extortion by this Government. It is a disgrace and people have condemned what the Government is doing in terms of the high taxes it takes from house property. Based on an average new house price of €259,912, the revenue accruing to the State, including VAT and stamp duty, on each property is €116,381. The introduction of the new development levy will impose an additional €8,000 on each new house. In October of this year, the average house price nationally was up 14% on the same period last year and up 200% on 1996 prices. Nationwide, new houses are up by 12% on last year while the price of second hand homes is up a staggering 17%. The gap between prices in Dublin and those outside Dublin is now seven times higher than when the coalition took office.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Development levies in some local authorities are being increased by anything up to 300%. Currently, development charges attached to planning applications can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála but there is no appeal procedure in place to allow developers or house purchasers to challenge the charges being imposed by local authorities. Local authority charges are an off-shoot of inadequate Government funding for local authorities and follow such stealth taxes as bin charges, parking rates and water charges on business and farmers. Owners of homes in the countryside face bills of up to €600 every two years to provide certification that their septic tanks have been emptied by a proper contractor. That is something on which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has spoken in detail in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Yesterday's announcement, or conjuring trick, by the Government in respect of increased funding for local authorities can at best be welcomed and at worst dismissed as another pre-local election stunt. Either way, this U-turn by the Government, which comes in the wake of pressure from Fine Gael and other Opposition parties, does not mean that local authorities will be able to avoid imposing heavy charges on the general public. The Government is still telling the local authorities that if they are short of funds, they have to raise the revenue themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">In my county, the Longford county executive of the IFA is meeting tonight with all public representatives in County Longford to encourage them to oppose the Government's development charges. Farmers are particularly angered at the proposal instructing local authorities to seek between €10 and €20 per square metre on farm buildings of more than 250 square metres in development charges at a time when all agricultural enterprises are in a depressed state.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The Government is also proposing a charge of €500 to €600 per hectare for forestry. The president of the Irish Farmers Association has rejected the new local authority planning charges for farm buildings, stating that they will impose significant and unjust cost increases on farmers and their families for necessary farm building work. He also noted that building work is needed to upgrade farmyard facilities to comply with environmental cross-compliance and local authority by-laws and secure commercial viability following the Luxembourg CAP reform agreement. More power to the IFA, Macra na Feirme, the GAA and other organisations which are vocal in their opposition to the development charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The Government is forcing local authorities to seek taxation by the back door and chase all options to raise money through stealth taxes and increased direct charges and rates to meet their funding shortfalls, which are a direct result of the Government's benchmarking deal. The proposed new charges will add significantly to housing costs in rural areas, with the proposed charge for rural housing as high as €12,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The rent allowance supplement has become another victim of this cavalier attitude to the less well-off. Applicants must be renting for at least six months before they can apply for this allowance, creating another bureaucratic stranglehold on the needy. Mr. McCreevy could be compared to the artful dodger and his Government colleagues will long be remembered as—</p>

          <p eId="para_294">What about those dependent on rental subsidies to enter the private rental sector with its prohibitive costs, such as young families waiting to be accommodated by local authorities? Health boards may refuse rent allowance to anyone not already renting for six months unless he or she is homeless. How are people supposed to pay high rents in private accommodation while they wait for the six months to elapse? This will drive many more people onto the homeless lists or the streets, a problem we witness nightly in close proximity to the House. More than 100,000 people, most of whom need to rent from the private sector, are seeking housing from their local authorities. Under the proposed changes, they will not be able to apply for rental subsidy for up to six months while they wait to be included on the priority list.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">In 1997, the Fianna Fáil Party promised to increase the first-time buyer's grant to €6,350 for couples and accelerate the supply of new houses. In 1998-99, the Government promised to control the increase in house prices and in 2002 it promised to implement a multi-stranded approach to addressing housing needs across the spectrum.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">While we all know the words of the Government in the run-up to the previous general election were cheap, for those dependent on it to take action to ease the housing crisis, they were a mockery. Promises have become this Government's hallmark, but empty words have a habit of coming back to haunt politicians. This country is tired of platitudes and worthless rhetoric. Fine words promised houses, schools, health and disability services and so forth. Where are they now?</p>
          <p eId="para_300">It is a national disgrace that despite our comparative wealth and prosperity, we cannot provide accommodation for our homeless. Concurrent with the growth in waiting lists there has been minimal growth in the provision of local authority social housing, with overall stock since 1996 rising by only 4,395 units or 4.47%.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I support the motion and condemn the Government for its failure, yesterday's gesture aside, to adequately fund local government. As we are all aware, inadequate funding is forcing local authorities to set exorbitantly high development levies which will result in higher prices for new homes, leaving young families, the weak and the vulnerable in an increasingly intolerable position. These levies will hinder the development of new businesses, cause excessive hardship in rural areas and damage the competitiveness of our economy.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_302">I second the motion. "A lot done, more to do" was the Fianna Fáil Party's slogan prior to the last election. "A little done, much more to do" was CORI's response to the recent budget. Like a colleague from the other House, I suggest everybody feels done at this stage by this Government, especially people on local authority lists, those trying to buy their first house and the increasing number of homeless people who feel betrayed and abandoned by a Government which has targeted the poor and disadvantaged for cuts in expenditure, rather than the well-off who could bear the burden much more easily.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The cold and callous act of abolishing the first-time buyer's grant last year hit young couples hard. These are young people trying to put a roof over their heads for the first time and start at the bottom of the property ladder and for whom every euro is budgeted for and counts. This heartless, uncaring Government pulled the rug from under them and scuppered their plans to try to provide homes for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Robbing first-time house buyers of their grant was an appalling act, but the Government was not yet satisfied. Last year's budget increased the VAT rate, thus raising the cost of new houses. Now we have the scandal of an increase in the development charges levied by local authorities of between 100% and 500%, depending on the area in which one resides. While it may be argued that development charges have been imposed for years, local authorities have never before been put in a position where they were left with no option but to raise these exorbitant charges and, in so doing, put another nail in the coffin of first-time housebuyers, a group the Government should be encouraging, rather than trampling on by withdrawing grants, raising prices, increasing development charges and imposing an increasing number of stealth taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">It is a sad day when a Government resorts to extracting €58 million from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of the community to help balance the books. When these cuts, particularly the rental subsidy regulations, kick in, they will inevitably lead to greater homelessness and lengthening local authority housing lists. Housing statistics issued by the Minister of State's Department for March 2003 indicated that 48,413 households were on local authority housing waiting lists. This represents an 80% increase since 1996. The number of homelessness now stands at 5,234 compared to 2,501 in 1996, an increase of 109% and a damning indictment of the Government's policies on housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Senators on the other side of the House regularly provide meaningless monetary statistics comparing Government expenditure in 1996 to current expenditure. We are speaking here of real people and families. Waiting lists for local authority houses have increased by 80%, while homelessness has increased by 109%. These are the plain facts. There are some 5,000 households, or over 130,000 people, on local authority waiting lists and over 5,500 are homeless. What a record for any Government to have, especially this Government after witnessing a period of unprecedented economic growth. It seems the Celtic tiger years have passed by some sections of society. They have seen their lot disimprove, in stark contrast to the Punchestown set and the wealthy, who have benefited most from the right-wing policies of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Is it not a sad reflection on the lack of vision and commitment of this Government in the area of housing policy, that our capital city has one of the highest rates of homelessness in Europe? There are more people homeless in Dublin than in Birmingham, Manchester and Bradford combined. This is the legacy of the housing policy of this Minister and this Scrooge-like Government. Local authority lists will continue to grow as a result of the failure to substantially increase the allocation for various social housing and accommodation programmes. The inadequate allocations will ensure the Government will fail to reach its own inadequate targets for increases in the provision of social housing as outlined in the national development plan. It is another case of grandiose promises and announcements with no additional finance and a lack of vision and commitment to even reach their own low targets set in the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The shortfall in 2004 is likely to be in the order of 2,500 to 3,000 units in the social housing provision. This is extremely regrettable considering the scale of the challenge that lies ahead in this area. The motion tabled by my party reflects the frustration felt by thousands of people on local authority waiting lists and the hopelessness felt by over 5,000 homeless people. It also reflects the growing anger of organisations working with the poor and the disadvantaged on a daily basis who have seen lip service rather than concrete action to solve the housing crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_312">"Seanad Éireann acknowledges the achievements of the Government in:</p>
          <p eId="para_313">– increasing the resources provided to local authorities through the local government fund and through the buoyancy in their income from local sources due to the success of this Government's policies;</p>
          <p eId="para_314">– ensuring that local authorities have adequate resources to service the land necessary for development, including industrial, commercial and housing developments;</p>
          <p eId="para_315">– ensuring that the cost to the public purse of servicing land for private development is recouped in part from the persons developing that land;</p>
          <p eId="para_316">– revising the long-standing system of levying development contributions to help fund local authority infrastructure to ensure it is implemented in a more transparent and consistent way across the country with a new role for the elected members of authorities in overseeing the system;</p>

          <p eId="para_320">and supports the continued action and commitment by the Government to adequately resource the local government system to underpin the continuing development and competitiveness of the economy."</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on the very fine work he is doing on housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">One of the great successes of this Government has been the creation of the local government fund which is ring-fenced as a source of funding for local government and is the key to the transformation that we are seeing in housing. The fund is financed from the proceeds of motor tax with the indexed Exchequer contribution. The fund has made over €1 billion available to local authorities in 2003 and will make over €1.2 billion available in 2004. Generally, the 2003 general purpose allocation of over €626 million was made from the fund. This transfers to local authorities adequate resources to enable them to provide day to day services, which is unprecedented. The amount being made available in 2004 is €752 million, an average increase of 14%, more than four times the expected rate of inflation. This buoyancy in the fund has enabled the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to increase general purpose grants to local authorities by approximately 85% since the coalition came into office in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">One of the issues here is planning, which has been raised in the House on many occasions, especially in smaller towns and villages. I know we have provided much money for water and sewerage schemes, but I see many studies on local authorities which refer to settlement centres in the smaller towns and villages. If one is setting a radius of 500 metres from the centre of a village for the purposes of development, the first thing to be done is the provision of sewerage, as I know many small towns where planning has been refused on the grounds of not having a sewerage scheme. This is something which I hope the Minister will examine. He has reduced the criteria for financial help to villages with a population of 1,000. He will have to reduce the criteria even further to help villages with even smaller populations, which I hope he will do.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I am very impressed with the figures I am reading in respect of spending on housing over the last few years. It has certainly been one of the successes of this Government that it has met the demand for housing, although it continues to be one of our major challenges. At the end of 1999 it was estimated that 500,000 new dwellings would be required over the ten years from 2000 to 2010 to meet the demand for housing. The Government has been successful in increasing the supply – the policies are having an effect. Since 1997, over 280,000 houses have been built nationally, with 2002 being the eighth consecutive year of record housing output, with almost 57,700 completions nationally, up 9.7% on the previous record achieved in 2001. Housing output in Dublin also reached a record level of 12,623 units built, an increase of 31.4%, in 2001. In the first six months of 2003 over 29,618 houses were completed nationally. All the indications are that we will have another record year this year for house completions.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I also know that house prices were increasing, which has been a major concern. In 1998, at their peak, prices were rising at an annual rate of 40%, but this has moderated significantly and I hope the Government will continue to provide a supply of houses that will maintain that moderation. We are very concerned about the housing situation and I hope the Government will have success on that front as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The development contributions, raised by Senator Bannon, have been misrepresented a lot in the media. These contributions have been in place since 1993, when the Planning Act was enacted. What is significant now is that the final decision for these development contributions rests with the elected members of local authorities, which is important. We have to provide public infrastructure and facilities that benefit an area. In the past they covered the normal public infrastructure like roads and sewers. In more recent times, and especially with the Planning and Development Act 2000, we now include community facilities, landscaping and public transport infrastructure under the development levy. It is important to discuss these issues as they are an important source of funding for local authority infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">In 2002, €151 million was collected in development contributions compared with €6.5 million in 1987. We must be aware of the importance of the levies and should also say that development contributions are not intended as a substitute for Exchequer funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">These issues will be considered in a rational way. We see headlines stating that a €28,000 levy is being imposed in certain parts of the country, but that is not the way to go. In my county the levies being discussed are in the region of €4,000 to €7,000. The members have the opportunity to consider where the levies will come from and what the rate will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">It is important to recognise the great work that has been done in the areas of voluntary housing, shared ownership schemes and so on. I compliment the NGOs which have provided housing through those schemes. It is important that this is happening in towns, but let us not forget the issue of one-off rural housing, which I mentioned, and the importance of providing infrastructure for smaller towns and villages in which people are being refused housing at present. If the Minister takes this into consideration, he will be looking after rural areas as well as towns.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_330">There is a crisis of homelessness in this country. There is a dire need for social housing, but in his budget speech the Minister for Finance did not mention either social housing or homelessness. These are serious issues, but they can be neglected because there is a feeling that there are no votes to be gained from dealing with them. To my sorrow, I find that in some areas in which social housing is to be built, there is a hail of planning objections. I regret that the plans of the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to ensure a social housing component in all new developments were delayed and reversed. It looks as though it will not be as popular as it was previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">There are some urban myths going around. One is that all single mothers are immediately given houses – as soon as they announce they are pregnant houses are provided for them. I have just talked to somebody who has been on the housing list for nine years and she never sees any sign of obtaining a house. There are many young women in her situation. One of the saddest things about the budget was the serious cuts in the provision of rent allowance to young women who may be about to become single mothers and a large cut in child care and crèche allowances. These are in direct conflict with the recommendations of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which suggests that the one thing that must be done to prevent women going to England for abortions, something we all want, is to give them material support at the difficult times of their pregnancies and when their babies are just born. There can be major conflicts within the family and frequently, even in this day and age, people feel they must leave home.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">We have set up an agency, costing a great deal of money, to promote options other than abortion, yet we totally ignore its suggestions about how this can be done. This is counterproductive and a waste of money. If social housing was built – I am not suggesting it should be given to people free but rented at a reasonable price – it would be a major step forward. This is a grave problem for many women.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Another group I have mentioned several times in the House although, again, there are no votes in this area, is the mentally ill. Senator Kitt mentioned NGOs which work in this area. I would describe them as charities because if charities such as the Salvation Army and the Simon Community did not step in, there would be even more mentally ill people on the streets. This is a serious problem. We must ask ourselves which comes first, the mental illness or the homelessness. If people have a mental illness it will become much worse while they are out on the streets. If they have been discharged into the community, as we all feel is best, from the mental institutions in which people used to be kept on a long-term basis and they do not have some sort of home, it is extremely difficult for the hard-pressed psychiatric carers within the community to keep an eye on them, encourage them to take their medication and so on. All we find is that they become more seriously ill and must be readmitted for acute care, perhaps having to stay in hospital for some time. If it were not for the charities there would be even more people on the streets.</p>

          <p eId="para_335">It can be seen that the funding is obviously not enough if one walks up Baggot Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The last group I will mention is prisoners. As Members know, we have a very high recidivism rate of almost 90%. How important is it that so many people who are released from prison are not in a position to go back to their families, who have perhaps had enough of them? As we frequently see, theft, especially for those involved in drug abuse, begins in the family home. These people have difficulty finding social housing. There are many groups of vulnerable people in our society which have been badly let down and are still being let down by the Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_337">I second the amendment and I welcome the Minister to the House. This Government and the previous one have probably done more to improve housing than any other in the history of the State. Perhaps the most obvious improvement has been in the standard and quality of local authority housing throughout the country. For example, in my area of central Dublin, in just one area committee patch, the transformation has been unbelievable. Areas such as Sheriff Street, Seán MacDermott Street and Summerhill have been transformed over the past ten years. People have left the damp, decrepit flats complexes and are in brand new housing. Nobody can tell me they want to go back to the way things were.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">We have many examples of this around the city. In Liberty Corner, Dublin 1, a public private partnership was set up. The area now has an enterprise centre, dance studios and a municipal arts centre. These areas had been ravaged by drugs and inadequate housing, but have been transformed due to investment. People who say we squandered whatever benefits the Celtic tiger gave us should take a drive around Dublin city and they will see the changes that have taken place. Six more projects are to be completed in 2004 in one area committee in Dublin, which is smaller than a city council area.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The local government fund increases have been ring-fenced and this has worked. It has increased by 130% since 1997, which is a massive investment. It is not a squandering of funds but good management and it has paid dividends. Dublin City Council will receive €81.5 million in 2004, which is an increase of 11% on the total for this year and a 130% increase since 1997. Limerick's funding has gone up 132% since 1997. All this funding is going into providing parks, footpaths, lighting and housing. Over the years the fund has levelled the playing field for areas which did not benefit from improvements taking place in the economy. It has spread the benefits. There has been a large increase in the range and quality of services provided by local authorities. The legislative changes that have taken place, including executive functions for managers, have streamlined the system and the controls and regulations put in place by the Minister in recent legislation will ensure the continued input of all sections, including local representatives. For many years I have heard councillors complain that their function has been diminished. They oversee the implementation of charges. The councillors will decide on the level of the charges; that is and will always be their function. I agree wholeheartedly that developers should have to contribute to the provision of facilities, community facilities, playing pitches and so on. In my experience the vast majority of developers have no problem with making a contribution. The level of charges will have to be decided by March in all local authority areas. That is one of the myths advanced about the charges. We have heard all sorts of rumours about €28,000, €17,000 and so on but no decision has been taken. Councillors will have a part to play when decisions have to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">In 1997, local authority spending, excluding roads, was €500 million and in 2004 it will be €1.6 billion, which is a massive increase. It is important to remember that the charges do not substitute for central funding. Another of the myths put about is that the charges will continue to be increased until they replace the central funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. That is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">On the issue of the provision of serviced land, we have all heard the cry that there are not sufficient houses. If a house comes on the market in my constituency, ten to 15 people look at it. The whole point of local authority funding is to provide serviced land. When one provides funding to increase the levies which pay for these services to be put in place, one is castigated for doing so. In the next breath people say there are not enough houses. One cannot have one without the other. There should be a balance between the two. The housing supply must be increased. House building has increased to such an extent that we have 57,695 houses, almost 10% up on last year. That is the fastest rate of growth in Europe. We are producing more houses than the UK per head of population.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Interest relief has been increased for first time buyers. There has been a huge improvement in affordable and shared ownership schemes throughout the country of which many young people are taking advantage. In my constituency there are a number of co-operative and social housing developments. This is another area of investment in which the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, through the local authorities, has gone out of its way. These are the policies of a so-called right wing Government. We have been accused of many things but on the figures before us we cannot be accused of this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_343">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House. I agree with the spirit of the motion which states that the first-time buyer's grant has been abolished and VAT on house purchases has been increased. As a member of a local authority for the past 18 years, I fully empathise with and support the structure and the good work it does in the housing areas. In many cases the directives emanate from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Many people find this issue difficult, particularly those building a house for the first time. In many cases some of the changes that have taken place in the Administration during the past two years have probably led to the escalating increase in the cost of houses. When the first-time buyer's grant of £3,200 was abolished, the Minister of State's colleagues protested loudly on the airwaves that this was a tragedy and a further deterrent to younger people who were attempting to build a house. That fizzled out and the first-time buyer's grant is gone. Last year VAT on house purchases was increased by an extra 1%. This impacts greatly on house building costs. This year the furore has waged around the various development levies. I recognise local authorities have a duty in regard to development levies and will have a role in deciding where the different projects will be located.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">As previous speakers have said, we had an unparalleled boom in the past five years. When I refer back to the achievements in my local authority area there were some major sewerage schemes but also many projects that were not completed, including many small scale sewerage schemes in local communities. As I have said here frequently, this is a contradiction in terms given that workers on local FÁS schemes plant trees, put new footpaths and nice stone walls in place and so on, yet many people are leaving those villages for the simple reason that they cannot build. The most basic infrastructure is a sewerage scheme. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would be criticised <i> vis-à-vis</i> the achievements over the five years in the area of the provision of sewerage schemes for many local communities in any county. I would be critical of that, but we did squander it in the provision of infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The development levies have been in operation in Limerick County Council during the past year. In the planning permissions granted the levies ranged from €1,200 to €1,800. There appears to be uniformity depending on what local authority administers these charges but there is a wide variation from county to county. The projected charge for one off houses in my local authority is approximately €3,200. The reason for that charge is that the person lives in a rural area. What services does the local authority provide to a person who is building a house in a cul-de-sac? In many cases the local authority does not provide the water because such a person sinks his own well. Given that there are no sewerage facilities, he will probably pay €4,000 to install a biocycle system because planning permission will not be granted in most locations for a septic tank. The biocycle system is another major cost which is added to the overall cost of the house.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Given all the charges imposed, it is projected that approximately 39% of the cost of a house outside the Dublin area, goes back to the Government by way of various charges; the projected percentage is 44% of the capital. It is fine to say an unparalleled number of houses are being built as this is possible as a result of the boom in the economy, but for the person building for the first time there are many disincentives and barriers. I recognise local authorities have been screaming for more powers and to a certain extent a devolution of powers is beginning to evolve. That is important. On the issue of the development charges which should be kept on a small scale, whereas I would be critical of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for not achieving in the past and failing to provide sufficient funding to local authorities, these are now the responsibility of local authorities and they will have an input. In my local authority I would like to see many sewerage schemes being put in place in communities which were not considered in the past. This is an indictment of the level of spending in those areas in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I do not understand Government policy sometimes. Much attention has focused on the social welfare cuts and the €56 million being saved. I try always to be objective in my analysis of a situation, but I cannot understand the six months barrier before one is considered for rent supplement. I predict the number of homeless people will be exacerbated owing to that restriction. I understand the Department's concern about landlords being the beneficiaries of the rent supplement and, therefore, escalating rental costs. However, there are other ways of tackling the problem than using a crude blunt instrument. Senator Henry was correct when she said these people do not vote. In that case, do they count? Perhaps politicians have a black spot in regard to that segment of the community. This is reflected in recent Government decisions. The Government is fortunate that the decentralisation programme was such an effective smoke screen in deflecting attention from a budget which contained punitive restrictions that mean people will pay more in the future. The Minister of State said that the comprehensive homelessness strategy would be implemented. What is this strategy? Does the six month rent supplement restriction form part of it?</p>
          <p eId="para_348">There has been a welcome recognition of the changing social profile of the State, with lone parents and deserted wives being taken into account. In a recently completed housing development in Newcastlewest, much of the development was made up of two bedroom apartments. That is timely because society and housing patterns have changed. Some of the measures taken by the Government in recent times have not acted as an incentive to first-time house buyers.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">Contrary to what the Opposition would say, the funding of local government has undergone a transformation in recent years. The Government is more than proud of its record in this area since we entered office in 1997. In 1998, we set up the local government fund as a ring-fenced source of funding for local government. In 2003, general purpose allocations of over €626 million were made from the fund, an unprecedented level of funding. With the growth of the fund we have been able to increase general purpose grants to local authorities by 85% since 1997. In 2003, the fund provided €394 million towards non-national roads, a doubling of grants since 1997.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_362">I realise local authorities have additional expenses this year but these huge increases, five times the rate of inflation, will pay for benchmarking and leave plenty more for efficient running of services and new projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">All in all, this represents an excellent outcome for the local government sector. The result of the new funding system is that local authorities are operating on a sound financial footing. I expect to see some good work next year, not just the maintenance of existing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Capital funding also increased during the lifetime of this Government. In 1997, the value, excluding roads, of Exchequer public capital programme expenditure in Estimates for the then Department of the Environment was marginally in excess of €500 million. The Abridged Estimate for the Department for 2004 will contain comparable expenditure of €1.6 billion for the same services. Virtually all this expenditure will be advanced to local authorities for a range of services which are mainly infrastructural.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">The announcement of the capital envelopes initiative in the budget will bring more certainty to the financing of multi-annual programmes, as well as more flexibility in the carryover of funding from one year to the next. While there may have been good funding of projects previously, people were not sure what would happen in the future. With an overall investment envelope of almost €34 billion in the five year period to 2008 our infrastructure will continue to be modernised in a planned and systematic manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Developers have paid development contributions since 1964, they are nothing new. They contribute towards the cost of the infrastructure necessary for all new developments. If they were not levied, the total cost of servicing land for house and office building would fall on taxpayers and rate payers. Without contributions, local authorities would not be able to invest in the facilities, such as parks and playgrounds, that make our communities better places to live. We all know it is not just about building houses, it is about building communities and giving them the services and facilities that allow them to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">Until now, the city and county manager decided how much to levy in contributions. Rates were not published and no justification was needed. This system was rightly criticised at local authority level. The Oireachtas, with cross-party support, introduced a new, transparent system in the Planning Act 2000. This system will offer predictability to developers because they will know in advance how much they have to pay in development contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The new system of development contribution schemes gives elected members in each authority the opportunity to be involved and to set the policy for development in their city or county. The final decision setting the levies for each type of development now rests with the elected members of each local authority. Councillors, therefore, have a new and important role in delivering better communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Last June, the Department issued a detailed circular to each planning authority that gave advice on how to make a development contribution scheme. We did not tell local councils how much to charge. On levels of contributions, the Department's circular was clear. It outlined that while it is expected that the planning authority should ensure that developers make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure and facilities, the local authority should take care to avoid development contributions that are excessively high. Although this may maximise funding for projects, it can also lead to negative social and economic pacts, such as excessive development contributions pushing up housing costs, therefore decreasing developer interest or affecting the affordability of houses. We do not want that to happen and there is no reason why it should happen. We have advised councils and we should leave it to them to get on with the job which they are doing. Already several of them have set their levies. Last week my local council chose to increase the level over the manager's recommendation and to exclude affordable houses. Fine Gael councillors on the seven or eight councils which have done their business have been very supportive and in most cases where there was a vote have been quite sensible and have supported the levy. I am glad of that and obviously there is more sense among Fine Gael representatives on the councils than among those in here. They are getting on fine without us even though we are no longer—</p>

In other countries, such as England, one pays development costs for schools as well as for the playground or local amenity. The key to defeating house price inflation is supply, and the development contribution system is crucial to providing the necessary services for land to build houses as well as the additional facilities that make it attractive to live and work in a place.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Our success in increasing house supply is reflected in the fact that house construction has increased so significantly in recent years. The figure for last year was 57,700 new units. We announced figures earlier this week for the first nine months of this year and they are up 15% to 16% on that figure. Figures often do not seem very meaningful but ten years ago we built 22,000 dwelling units while this year it will be 60,000 or more. That is an extraordinary increase.

The housing provision for next year announced in the recent Estimates has gone up by 5.5%, which is one of the biggest increases. The overall housing package will be €1.88 billion next year and that will allow for 5,000 starts under the main local authority programme, which is an increase of 500 on this year, and the voluntary housing sector is now providing between 1,500 and 1,600 houses a year. While there are 48,000 people or families on the waiting list, the needs of between 12,500 and 12,700 will be met this year and next year. That is a very significant number. Even when people like to cite the 48,000 on the waiting list, in comparing that with ten years ago it is necessary to compare like with like. Ten years ago if one was single one would not qualify to get on the list unless one was receiving the old age pension. Now the system has changed. It is much easier to get on the waiting list and one is not comparing like with like when referring to the situation ten years ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">Some 30% of people on the waiting list are single while another 32% are lone parents with one child. Therefore, some 62% of those on the waiting list are either single or lone parents with one child. Just under 20% of families on the waiting list in Fingal and south Dublin local authority areas are non-nationals who have been given asylum status or the right to stay here. Those families were not on the waiting list ten years ago. If one states that the number on the waiting list has increased by X% or Y% compared to some years ago, one is not comparing like with like.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_413">Matters have changed greatly. Did that person get an offer of a house in the meantime? I know of people who have been on the waiting list for 20 years. They hope to build a house in the field across the road from the mother of one or other partner, but they are not in immediate need of accommodation. I talked to county managers and obtained details concerning such families and have been told that three or four offers of houses have been made to them, but have been turned down. Some people stay on the waiting list hoping that they will get the house of their dreams in the ideal location. I own my house, as many others do, but people cannot always afford to buy a house where they would like to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The real need of many such people could be examined. I am not saying people do not have a right to be on the waiting list. They have and I sincerely hope they get the house of their dreams, but many people have received a number of offers of a house. If I wanted to, I could probably bring in a rule providing that if a person refuses two offers of a house, he or she will be taken off the waiting list. I am not considering any such measure. Simply because there are 48,000 people on the waiting list does not mean that number of people are in crying need of accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Another major development is the introduction of legislation on the private rented sector giving rights and protection to tenants in accommodation after a six month period. It will be introduced in this House as soon as it has been passed in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">What we have done in terms of local government funding and in housing provision is a record of success. The new role for councillors in regard to development levies represents an enhancement of their role, which they accept. Such a measure has been passed by members across party lines in seven or eight councils without any hassle. They have been very responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">For the reasons I outlined, I commend the amendment to the House. Good work is being done and people around the country are far more sensible than we are or pretend to be in here because they know the job facing them and are aware of the need for the provision of facilities. Years ago we heard about builders building houses and leaving estates without carrying out landscaping or providing any facilities. Councillors know the value of not only building houses but building communities. That is what it is all about and the introduction of development levies will allow councils to build houses, facilities and communities where people can rear their families and have a good quality of life. Councillors know that damn well.</p>

In the ten years the parties in Government have been in office, the position regarding housing has gone out of control. The number of people, particularly young people, who cannot afford to buy a house at today's prices and whose financial position does not enable them to qualify for a mortgage at one end of the spectrum and at the other end there is the spiralling increase in house prices. This has created a niche, which is unfortunate. We are familiar with other systems in place, and the Minister of State referred to the cutting back in the rent allowance scheme, which was a retrograde step. It affects people living in accommodation in respect of which a subvention was paid by the State. That subvention represented an important segment of the finance that allowed such people to live in rented accommodation while waiting to be housed by a local authority</p>

That grant of €3,800 did not represent a great deal of money in terms of house prices, but one has to consider the way young couples, in particular, factored in that grant in terms of building a profile that would allow them to take out a mortgage and ease some of the financial pressure they were under, but the first-time buyer's grant was abolished in one fell swoop. That was disgraceful and there is no defending that decision. There were many other ways of raising required revenue, if that was the intention behind abolishing the grant, apart from that measure which affected young couples who wanted to climb on to the property ladder.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">The number of people on the waiting list is an indication of the extent of the housing problem. Great improvements have been made in terms of local authority housing schemes in recent years, although not as many as we would like. As soon as there is an improvement in terms of buildings, the housing list begins to swell for obvious reasons. Comparative numbers on the waiting list in the western division of Cork County Council between November this year and March last year show a huge increase in the number of people deemed appropriate applicants. The current figure is 1,116, whereas in March 2002 the figure was 594. That is due to a number of obvious reasons, but a doubling of the number of people on the housing list in that division is a frightening statistic. A breakdown of categories of applicants is given, be they single parents with one child or single parents with two children. As always, there is a high number of single males on housing lists. That is a trend I followed for some time when I was a member of the council. In terms of deciding who is fit for an allocation, the decision always militates against elderly single men in particular, which is unfortunate. When I was elected to the council there were a number of people who wanted public representatives, particularly councillors, to make representations on their behalf regarding the housing list. In all honesty, if they were single elderly men, one could not eyeball them and tell them they would get priority because they would not.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">Absolutely, even if they are in that particular category. I am not being ageist, but in terms of the age profile of such applicants, they are significantly higher than the normal applicant.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">There were such a high number of male applicants that the local authority designated a scheme of ten houses to people in that category, and also to single females. That was universally welcomed in the community. While allocations meet the need of a number of people and bring untold happiness to those who are lucky enough to get them, those who do not get such an allocation remain unhappy. With regard to this particular case, I had never witnessed an allocation on which there was universal approval. All those allocated a house in that scheme were genuinely decent people on low incomes who had worked all their lives and such allocations were a recognition of their status by the local authority, which was welcome. I do not know if it is possible for a Minister to do this, but the issue of parity and equality in the allocation of units should be examined in the longer term. It stands to reason that someone with a number of children in bad accommodation should get a house, but we should not discriminate against single applicants.</p>

Of concern now is the rate at which these charges will increase, due to the manipulation of section 48 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act. In the case of a charge of perhaps €1,200 or €1,300, it was reasonable to expect someone to pay such a fee because of the costs of infrastructure such as footpaths, sewerage and water and so on. The Act is now being used to implement a type of development tax. If the figure suddenly jumps from about €1,000 to more than €5,000, which is the type of rise likely in my constituency, that is a major increase. It may prove a crucial sum in terms of getting a mortgage.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">In recent times we have seen that the consumer very often has to pick up the tab. The increased charges are a retrograde step. This major increase will stretch budgets that are already tight and will result in some people being unable to buy their own houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">One could fill the House with housing reports, but there is a pattern in them which shows that building material costs and construction charges have remained almost static. In some cases there may have been an increase of as little as 0.6% while the increase in the cost of the house could be as much as 10% or 15%. This is a serious anomaly. The house cost increase is due to the very high price of building land. There has been much debate about that issue, but it needs to be tackled. If we do not tackle it and do not look at the component factors such as the provision of infrastructure and the cost of building land and materials, we will end up with a situation that is unacceptable to those seeking houses or to the decision makers who must deal with the matter. I am aware that this debate has been going on for some time in the Dáil, but we need to consider capping the price of building land. I may be wrong, but I believe the Taoiseach suggested the possibility of a referendum on the issue next June.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The housing issue is worrying. We need only look at the reports, observations and pre-budget submissions of many of the voluntary agencies such as Threshold and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. All those involved have professional expertise. They are committed to the matters they deal with and have vast banks of knowledge. When they tell us there is a housing problem, we need to listen. One can expect Opposition Members to point to problems, but those people are at the coal face. They have the data and the statistics. People come to them requesting houses. Action is needed.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and I congratulate him on his work in the housing offices of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The Government can stand proudly over its performance since it came to power in 1997. In 1998 the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act introduced reforms which transformed financing from central government by providing a buoyant source of income to local authority funds. Since its establishment, €208 million more than the level required by indexation has been provided by the Government. In 2003 general purposes allocations of over €626 million have been made from this fund. In 2004 the figure will be €752 million. This transfer to local authorities is unprecedented. General purpose grants to local authorities have increased by 85% since 1997. The fund also provided €394 million towards non-national roads in 2003, a doubling of such grants from 1997 to 2003. This was a fine achievement by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Exchequer capital spending on local authority and social housing in 1997 was €214 million. In 2004, similar supports will amount to €930 million. Taking inflation into consideration over this period, the increase in funding is dramatic. The Government's success in increasing supply is reflected in eight consecutive years of house completions. From 1997 to 2003, some 280,000 houses were built nationally. That is a big change from the time when Senator Bannon's party was last in Government, when builders were closing daily until Fine Gael fell from power.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">We will meet the challenge of providing the 500,000 dwellings required from 2002 to 2010. We will invest in infrastructure to bring more serviced land into use. These policies will combine with expansion of affordable housing schemes and the development of the voluntary housing sector. The total housing provision in 2003 is €1.8 billion, four times the amount provided in 1997. From 2000 to 2003, €5.9 billion has been provided for housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Government will maintain a high level of house supply to meet the strong demand and in this way seek control of increased prices. Affordability is the key. From 2000 to 2002, some €3.08 billion, which is 109% of the national development plan forecast for social and affordable housing measures, has been spent by the Government in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The Government has increased the total housing provision for 2004 by 5.5%, bringing it to €1,885 million despite pressures on public finances. The 2004 provisions will allow 5,000 housing starts under the main local authority programme, an increase of 500 from the 2003 level. A further 500 units will commence under the area regeneration programme. Together with the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, this will allow for the needs of about 12,500 households to be met in terms of social and affordable housing measures over the period of the housing programme, compared to 8,500 in 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The Government has provided record financial support for local authorities, which have never been better funded to carry out their housing work. Local authority members will have greater responsibility in reviewing the planning system to ensure transparency and to create a greater role for the future development of their areas. Development contributions have been a feature since 1964 and they allow local authorities to fund part of the costs of infrastructure necessary to facilitate new development in terms of roads, water, sewerage services, amenities and community facilities. These contributions apply not just to housing, but to all developments. They give local authorities the power to recoup a fraction of the costs to back the public funds for servicing this land being bought by developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Are the Senators on the Fine Gael benches suggesting that builders should not pay a fee for the provision of this infrastructure to service their developments? The fee is a small portion of the costs. These extra allocations are being put in place by local authorities throughout the country. They will be put to good use in implementing county development plans developed by all parties. There is an obligation on us to be serious about the further development of our country. This Government will take such development seriously.</p>

          <p eId="para_453">This is a very important debate. It is a little dreary when people read prepared statements supplied by Departments. There is some slight evidence that may have been happening in the House today. Important issues are involved. I am somewhat divided between the two sides of the argument. I see merits in the motion itself because the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant is something that worries young people coming into the market. On the other hand this cushioned developers. When they saw it they snaffled it and – I am rather fond of this word so I will use it for the second time today in the House – trousered it themselves. There may be an argument for removing the grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">There is a worrying increase in the price of housing. One need only look at Thursday's property supplement in <i>The Irish Times</i> and see the “Five At” column. For €500,000 one can get a converted lavatory with a corrugated tin roof on the North Circular Road in Dublin, a villa in Florida or an estancia in South America. If this bubble bursts people will have negative equity and houses will be repossessed. Controlling the price of houses and the rate of increase is important and in everybody's interest because those who already have equity in housing may find their inflated equity destroyed when the bubble bursts. This is something to be looked at with a great deal of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">We have a slightly different view of housing from many other European countries. We appear to believe that it is a human right to be afforded a house by the State. This is unusual. In most European countries, for example, people live in apartments. Possession of a house provided by the State hardly qualifies as a human right.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">However, one is entitled to shelter and this is an area where the State has maximum responsibility because it is one where there are people in considerable difficulty. Single people, and particularly single men, are a vulnerable group. There is a concealed discriminatory element here because gay people are always seen as single and are not entitled to be seen as part of a couple. This means that no gay person is likely to have housing provided by the State. This needs to be examined. I do not suggest that AIDS is a gay disease but in the early days of this infection a disproportionately high number of gay people had AIDS. They need housing. It is awful to think that people who are in recovery, thanks to the triple drug therapy, are in dire need of housing and that local authorities ignore them.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I compliment the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr. Royston Brady. I was abroad when he made his interesting gesture. People may say his action was mere PR, but it was extremely good and positive PR and the kind of thing people like to listen to and read about. It was picked up by the BBC, where I heard it. The Lord Mayor offered the facility of the Mansion House to a homeless couple for their wedding and also managed to secure accommodation and shelter for them. That is laudable.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">I go every Sunday to St. Patrick's Cathedral. Last Sunday a special prayer was said for a man called Edward. His name is all I know about him. I asked why they prayed for him and I was told he was found dead on a patch of waste ground near the Cathedral. He used to come into the Cathedral just to be near other people. This is the kind of extreme dealt with by organisations like Focus Point and the wonderful people who go around with soup runs. I came across an idea in a casual meeting with Anne Connolly from the Simon Community and an architect friend of hers. It is something the Government could look at in partnership with private industry. A series of container trucks could be fitted out as accommodation, driven to the places where homeless people congregate so that they could be out of the winter weather and given food and clean bedding. The trucks could then be driven away, hosed down, cleaned out and brought back at night. They would not be a visual obstruction or an unpleasantness because they would be on the streets when the city is fairly dormant in the areas where homeless people live. This is an interesting and useful idea. It would provide shelter for these people, remove them from the anxiety of having to provide for themselves in cardboard boxes and from the indignity and reproach we all feel as citizens when we see these things happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The cost of land must be tackled by the Government. There has, traditionally, been a suspicion that Fianna Fáil is a little too close to the construction industry, that the relationship is too comfortable and that too many contributions have been made. I do not say this in antagonism. I am not a member of the Opposition. I am Independent. It is in Fianna Fáil's interest to tackle this matter and to make it clear that this cosy relationship does not exist and that Fianna Fáil is prepared to take on people who are skimming off money from people who can least afford it, by charging excessive prices for land.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I support the Minister of State's policy on development levies. Of course people who develop should pay levies. Why should the taxpayer pay for sewerage and infrastructure? This is an appropriate method of funding these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The Minister of State also referred to playgrounds. A wonderful playground has been provided in Gardiner Street, near where I live. It is heartening to see so many members of the community with their children, looking after them, protecting them and helping them to use the equipment. It is splendid and it brings life to the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">We heard much about decentralisation. How about recentralising a few things into the north inner city, a constituency and a community the Minister of State and his brother know well? Every single northside Department is to be decentralised.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">I am pleased that the levies have been regularised at long last. Up to now as a county councillor I did not know where these levies were being used. Now I know what is being spent on roads infrastructure, open spaces and community development. It is time developers make the commitment to finish off housing estates and it is time that they give something back to the system. I could hardly believe the spin in the newspaper headlines last week, that a new levy of €10,500 was being imposed on houses. We were inundated with telephone calls from people asking if this would happen. We must ensure that the buyer does not bear the cost. The market should decide. We must get it right and there may be a challenge for us. We are making great progress in the number of houses being built. I admit there is more to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">In Tallaght, which is my area, the quality of life in Jobstown, Fettercairn and Killinarden has been transformed. The houses have been serviced and it is now a pleasure to visit these places. It was not a pleasure in the past and it was dangerous to visit them ten years ago. That change is a sign of real achievement. I want to see a new quality of life for people and I want to help those who cannot help themselves. The county councils have an important role to play. I congratulate county councils and local authorities on their achievements in improving the quality of life for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Other speakers referred to the rent allowance. I remind the House that nothing has been signed off. I compliment the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. She merely stated that there is an element of abuse of the system and she is laying down a marker but that she will be flexible to allow people who have a case to make to do so. She will not deprive anybody of a rent allowance if they need it. I know she would not do that. The Opposition put a spin on matters in order to make itself look good. I also compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.</p>

          <p eId="para_490">I wish to share my time with Senator Brian Hayes. I am glad the Minister of State is in the House because there is no point in speaking about the Minister of State behind his back or making complaints when he is not present. I am genuinely disappointed not simply by the Minister's speech but by the approach he has taken over the past 12 to 18 months. I debated with the Minister of State in the other House on a number of issues and often listened with interest to his contributions. I genuinely believed he would introduce radicalism and a new approach to his office, which I believe to be the ministry for housing. Sadly he has become a prisoner not just of his Department but of the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The current housing statistics concerning local authority tenants and those on the local authority waiting lists are exceptionally depressing. Senator Norris spoke about the 50,000 or 60,000 houses being built and they are referred to in the Government's amendment to the motion. The Government is building 5,000 or 6,000 houses in this calendar year or the next. I wish to quote statistics referring to my own area. In the mid-1980s when this country was in the grip of a major economic crisis, approximately twice as many local authority houses were being built.</p>

This year in north Cork there will be sufficient funding for approximately 80 or 90 starts in direct and affordable housing. In 1985, the local authority built 150 houses. We have not made the progress we should be making and we are failing to do so now at a time when significant resources are available, allthough there may not be as much available as there was two or three years ago.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_205">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_495">I would like to be able to add in those figures but from what the Minister of State said, and taking into account voluntary and direct housing, we are still using much less resources for direct housing than in the mid-1980s. The statistics speak for themselves. We need to examine the area of direct housing. There are policy options which can be taken on housing. Even when money is scarce it is a question of choice. This may relate to what Senator Henry said earlier that some of the people on the housing list and some of the homeless do not vote and that perhaps they are not regarded as politically important. We tend to ignore those people. We have a social responsibility to address the housing issue. Other speakers made the point that a different method is used now for compiling a housing list and people are now on housing lists who may not have previously been considered. Approximately 100,000 people on a housing list in post-Celtic tiger Ireland is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Much could be done in the area of rented accommodation. I accept that the legislation which has been passed is a small step forward but as a nation we need to change our approach to tenancy and to rented accommodation. If a person won the lotto or won €10 million and invested in a shop or a pub or a business, he would be regarded as an economic hero. If the same person invested that money in providing top quality, regulated rental accommodation, he would be seen as some sort of crook. We need to change our approach to landlords and tenants and advanced legislation should be introduced. We are moving forward in a fair direction in that regard. To coin a phrase, while much may have been done, there is much more to do. The Minister of State should be campaigning more radically. When I was a Member of the Lower House, I often heard him speaking more like a member of the Opposition than a Government backbencher. Now that he has power in his hands, he should look beyond the confines of his office to adopt new approaches towards solving this problem. The solutions can be found with some innovation, vision and political courage.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_497">I agree with everything my colleagues have said but I wish to make some additional points. The Minister of State should consider abolishing the homelessness agency. I suspect what I am going to say is not a million miles from his own thinking on this matter, if he were allowed to admit it honestly. I have always admired his straight talking in Opposition. Three years ago, when the report on homelessness was published, the Taoiseach announced an inter-agency response to the problem but it is not working. We have not seen any additional units in Tallaght where I live and where there is a substantial problem of homelessness. The Minister of State should abolish the homelessness agency tomorrow, put all the do-gooders to one side along with the inter-agency response, and take control of the matter himself. In my short time in politics I have learned that as a society we fail completely where we leave inter-agency groups to handle anything. Politicians are better equipped to respond to the problem and they are ultimately accountable to the Oireachtas, while the homelessness agency is not. The Minister of State should take control of the issue, particularly at this time of the year, because three years after the famous homelessness report came out, we are not making enough progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The Minister of State should also initiate a survey on the availability of central heating in local authority houses. When I inquired about this three years ago, I was appalled to discover that up to 60% of all council and corporation houses in the country had no central heating. Senator Ormonde spoke about Tallaght but as she knows, some 70% of council houses there do not have central heating. All the houses that have been built in the last five years have such heating, but prior to that there was no stipulation to provide it. Thousands of local authority homes do not have central heating on these cold winter nights. The Minister of State should sort that out. Sometimes politicians are remembered for simple things, such as when the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, dealt with the issue of smokeless coal. The Minister of State could be remembered as the person who introduced central heating in every local authority home. It would not cost much because he could demand that local authorities use their capital accounts to bring that about. In one fell swoop, he could resolve another form of poverty that is inflicted on people. The Minister of State should carry out the necessary survey, thus enabling the job to be done over the next three years by using local and national resources.</p>

        <speech by="#TomMorrissey" eId="spk_207">
          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_499">The suggestion that the Government has presided over a trebling of house prices is a cheap shot. The reality is that in 1995, housing output comprised 30,000 private and public units. Less than 4,000 houses were built in the public sector in 1995, compared to 6,000 in 2002, from a total of 55,000. Some 67,000 houses will be built this year, which is a dramatic figure by any standards across Europe. Last year, we were told that 55,000 was a record figure, so 67,000 is truly a dramatic total.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Figures released today by the Central Statistics Office show that we had a net immigration of 41,300 people last year, compared to a CSO estimate of only 29,000. This demonstrates how difficult it is to keep up with the demand for housing, including local authority housing lists. The estimated increase in immigration of 19,000 indicates an increased demand for 6,000 houses based on three-person households.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">No Government has provided more for housing. In 1996, a total of €451 million was provided from the public capital spending programme, which is 10%. Today that figure stands at €1.7 billion or 20%. The increasing demand for housing has resulted in house builders and developers having been able to increase the price of houses over the last few years. However, with an increase in supply coming on stream, particularly in Dublin, we should see a levelling off in price increases. I do not expect that the increase in levies will be paid for totally by house buyers because with an increasing housing supply, builders will be unable to pass on the full cost of these new levies from next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I remember being on Fingal County Council when two development plans were adopted. The position of the Labour Party at that time was to prevent additional land coming on stream. Had they won the day, the price of houses would be even higher then it is currently because the supply would be much less. To hear Labour Party representatives speaking in this debate makes a mockery of where they stood on the two development plans in my own council area. Perhaps other Senators will have had similar experiences in their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The abolition of the first-time buyer's grant had little or no effect on housing demand. In any event, it was aimed at only about 10% of the total market. The recent ESRI mid-term report suggested that the Government should consider reducing such supports as a method of damping down demand. When I bought my first house, the price increased by €2,000 the day the grant was increased from €1,000 to €3,000, but the builder was the beneficiary, not the purchaser. I have no doubt that was not an isolated case, but was widespread. Housing is and will continue to be a priority for the Government. Indeed, housing receives 34% of the resources of the national development plan, compared to 27% for roads. The record of the Government will stand the test of time. It is important to continue to increase the housing supply and I hope that is where the Government's focus will remain.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">On the development charges, in his contribution the Minister said that the only people who will be affected by those are developers. What about the many young people who will try to provide a house for themselves and go through the process of applying for planning permission? That happens to a great extent in rural Ireland. When people make an application they take in hand the whole planning process. They go to the local authority and get planning permission but what has this Government done? It has savagely imposed a cost of €12,000 in some counties. That is a fact.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_543">I reiterate my welcome for the extra €55 million provided, between the Book of Estimates and the budget, for school buildings. I suppose it was directed more towards primary than secondary schools, but the budget allocation was for both.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">The attention of the Minister for Education and Science and his Department should be drawn to the situation of Newtown Upper national school, which sometimes is also called Upper Newtown national school. It is approximately five miles up in the hills beyond Carrick on Suir, right on the Kilkenny border near the high crosses of Ahenny. It is a lovely location but also a very exposed one. The main building is in reasonably good order but the space for staff and remedial teaching is very cramped and limited. There are plans to extend a room that would double up both as office space and a remedial teaching room. The real scandal is the state of the outside toilets. There is a legitimate view that in this day and age young children should not be forced to go out in all weathers to the toilets. The issue was given major coverage, it was the main story in <i>The Nationalist </i>newspaper the week before last and also featured in the <i>Irish Star</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Reading between the lines of comments made at a meeting I attended, it is clear that the INTO attaches a very high priority to the situation being remedied. The point was made at the public meeting that public schools like this, where there is a very good ethos and terrific support from parents, are not those from which the social problems of modern life emanate; they certainly have not done so from past pupils of this type of school. It is a very fine two teacher school with 36 pupils, and there was virtually a full turnout of parents at the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">There is one point to be drawn to the Department's attention. The people concerned have been to the building unit and have been told there is an estimate to carry out the necessary works at a cost of €400,000. The local people believe this is by no means the most economical way of doing things and that it should not be costing that much, but sometimes things are done purely through official processes and the contractors always tend to issue a high estimate to the State. They are considering as a possible alternative proposing to obtain their own estimates, which may be cheaper for the purposes of getting the work done, would save the State money and might also help progress matters faster. A school near the Minister's own constituency, Inagh national school in Monard, did just that in the past year, ultimately with departmental approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">In the knowledge that decisions are likely to be made in January on this subject – I appreciate that the Minister may not be in a position to give me the good news now – I would nonetheless urge the Department to consider this project as it is relatively modest in terms of overall improvement costs. The need at the school is very pressing and the children and families of the Newtown Upper national school area will only get what they deserve if the improvement works proceed.</p>

          <p eId="para_549">The 2003 capital programme was published in January 2003 and full details of individual projects are available on the Department's website.

I am pleased to inform the Senator that a large-scale building project for Newtown Upper national school, Carrick on Suir, County Tipperary, is listed in section seven of the 2003 school building programme.

          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_552">I have raised this matter on previous occasions, both in the Dáil and the Seanad. I have a copy of a statement I made on this issue in the Dáil as far back as 26 November 1997, which is over six years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">This school has been on the building list of the Department of Education and Science for the longest period of any school, I suppose. The application goes back 12 years. The Gaelscoil started in 1985 and has 13 teachers and 118 pupils. It has an excellent track record in education. Over two years ago the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, visited the school and saw at first hand the urgent necessity for a replacement school. The school is located in the community centre and seven pre-fabricated buildings. Due to the parents' financial commitments the school erected two pre-fabricated buildings recently. In June 2003 the Department of Education and Science rejected even giving a rent allowance for the two pre-fabricated buildings on the basis that they were lacking in funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The school has advanced to stage four and five with costings agreed. The design of the school has been agreed and a fire certificate can also be furnished. All that is required at this stage is a commitment from the Department of Education and Science to allow the school to go to tender. It is now a matter of urgency that this commitment be given. The present educational achievements have been obtained in an environment which is not conducive to educational purposes. Newcastlewest has rapidly expanded and has been approved for the decentralisation project for 50 Revenue staff. I hope the Minister, at this stage, will allow the school to proceed to tender and the much-needed new school to be erected.</p>

          <p eId="para_555">I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to this House the Department of Education and Science's position regarding an application from the authorities of Gaelscoil Ó Doghair, Newcastlewest, Limerick, for grant aid towards a new school building.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">At present, Gaelscoil Ó Doghair has a staffing level of a principal plus eight mainstream class teachers. The enrolment at 30 September 2003 was 198.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Gaelscoil Ó Doghair's present facilities comprise two rented rooms in a community centre and five portacabins purchased by the Gaelscoil. I am pleased to inform this House that a full design team has been appointed and architectural design of the project is progressing. The Gaelscoil Ó Doghair building project is listed in section six of the 2003 school building programme, which is published on the Department's website. This proposed project is currently at stage four to five of architectural planning – detail design, bill of quantities. It has been assigned a band two rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The architectural design of additional accommodation is based on nine stages. The design and planning of the project is covered by stages one to five, during which the project is developed from the assessment of site suitability, through the detailed design, including the obtaining of planning permission to the point where detailed bills of quantities are prepared.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">At stage six, tenders are sought in line with public procurement procedures and subsequently a tender report is prepared and examined. Assuming that the outcome of the tender process is acceptable in terms of procurement procedures, providing value for money and that funds are available to meet construction costs, a construction contract is placed at that stage and the construction of the project begins.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Stages seven to nine cover post-contract cost control throughout the construction period, construction and practical completion of the project, including hand-over of the building to the proposed occupiers and the completion of the cost analysis in the form of the final account, ensuring that cost control was maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The Department of Education and Science intends to publish details of the 2004 school building programme by early January at the latest.

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Disabled Person's Grant.</heading>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_567">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for taking this matter on the Adjournment. Disabled persons in the midland region are caught in an impasse between the Government and general practitioners about the payment of a €65 fee which the Irish Medical Organisation has requested on behalf of its members for the completion of the required medical certificates for disabled person's grant applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">While I appreciate the position of the GPs on the principle that the labourer is worthy of his or her hire and because of the additional workload placed on them, it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that the disabled are not left once again at the mercy of the system. Medical officers in the Midland Health Board previously carried out the assessment of applicants for the disabled person's grant but because of staffing pressures, this system was discontinued in 2002. Subsequently, a letter was issued to Longford GPs outlining the new requirements, under which doctors were requested to fill in medical forms on behalf of their patients. GPs rightly resisted taking on this extra work without payment and, through the IMO, requested the €65 fee.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The main area of contention is that this additional workload was imposed on GPs without consultation. People were coming into surgeries expecting the forms to be completed without any prior notification from the relevant authorities. The completion of medical certificates is not provided for within the GMS contract. Who will pay these fees? The Government will not pay while Longford County Council and other local authorities in the region are unable to pay due to budgetary shortfalls. Local authorities are not funded for this sort of expenditure. Matters are at a virtual standstill, leaving an unacceptable backlog of applicants waiting to have essential works carried out in their homes. This grant is essential to ensure that the disabled can have a reasonable standard of mobility and normality in their own homes. It enables them to have remedial aids such as ramps, walk-in showers and rails installed.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">It has been stated over and over again in this House and in the Dáil that the weakest in our society are bearing the brunt of the Government's financial ineptitude. This must stop. The disabled are not pawns in the game of budgetary cutbacks and financial irresponsibility. It is a national disgrace and symptomatic of the heartless approach of the Government that fiscal rectitude could in any circumstances take precedence over the provision of basic needs for the disabled. I am asking the Minister to take the pressure off those who are least able to bear the burden. He should show some heart and look after our disabled and elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Perhaps the Minister will explain what the Government intends to do to resolve this impasse because this is a serious problem in the midlands. Elderly people, disabled people and those who are in pain are waiting to have necessary repairs to their houses carried out under the disabled person's grant, but their medical certificates are not being signed so the local authority is not in a position to process their applications. Those people need some quality of life. They are the most vulnerable people in our society and everyone's heart bleeds for them. I appeal to the Minister to do something about this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_573">I have made inquiries of the Midland Health Board about this matter and it has been explained to me that the board has no statutory function in the administration of the disabled person's grant. The Government is aware of the importance of this grant in helping to meet the accommodation needs of disabled persons, but the operation of the disabled person's grant scheme at local level is the responsibility of local authorities and one in which neither the Minister for Health and Children nor the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has any direct function. Authorities operate within a framework laid down in statutory regulations, which is designed to give them an appropriate degree of flexibility in administering the scheme. It is for local authorities to decide the level of funding to be provided for disabled person's and essential repairs grants in their area from within the capital allocation notified to them by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. That Department's involvement in the scheme relates primarily to the recoupment by authorities of two thirds of their expenditure on each grant. The balance of one third of the cost is funded from the authorities' own resources from an amount included for that purpose in their annual estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The Senator raised the issue of the payment of fees to a general practitioner for medical certificates. The Midland Health Board has confirmed that the provision of such certification is not part of the GMS contract and that such an arrangement is a private matter between the doctor and the patient. I was not aware of this matter, which seems to arise only in the Midland Health Board region, and I am not happy with it. I will investigate whether there is anything further I can do. I agree that what is happening is appalling. The people applying for the disabled person's grant have enough problems without this one. In this case it seems the problems are being added to by the general practitioners – it is unfair to blame the Government. The problem is peculiar to the Midland Health Board area. I will investigate and reply to the Senator directly.</p>
