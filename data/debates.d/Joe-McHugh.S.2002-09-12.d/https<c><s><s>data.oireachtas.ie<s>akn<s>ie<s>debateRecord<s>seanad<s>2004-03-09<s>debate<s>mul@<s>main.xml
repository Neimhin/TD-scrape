          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to outline the action she will take to address the shortage of community welfare officers in the Dublin 15 area as a result of which the drop-in hours have been suspended and all applications must be in writing or taken over the telephone.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_5">We are not opposed to the Order of Business.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">This morning many of us throughout the country heard the harrowing evidence given in the High Court yesterday by Mrs. Murphy in the ongoing trial concerning the manslaughter of Brian Murphy. His death was, to say the least, the worst nightmare of a mother and a father but one lesson needs to be learned from this trial. I do not intend to comment on the trial itself but we must learn a lesson from the way victims are treated in the criminal justice system. It appears a number of simple measures need to be put in place in our courts to ensure victims' voices are heard. First, we need bigger courtrooms so that victims are given adequate space and a designated area where they and their families can listen to the trial and, second, we need to inform victims on an ongoing basis about the progress of prosecutions brought before the courts. Those two straightforward measures need to be put in place in the context of a greater debate on the way we treat victims in our criminal justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">The Murphy case and the media exposure thereof highlights the need for a more detailed debate on the voice of victims in our criminal justice system. We need that debate and this House would be a perfect venue in which a proper debate could occur. I urge the Leader to bring forward that debate as soon as possible because the voice of victims is largely forgotten and it is to our shame as a Legislature and a courts system that that is happening.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_8">On the same issue, in a previous job I had a colleague who dealt with people who insisted on taking people through the courts. In her very first discussion with them she always told them that if they were looking for justice they should go to heaven but if they were looking for the law they should go to the courts. The courts are never the place for justice. They have never been intended to be the place for justice and people are confused about that. That is one of the reasons we are one of the most litigious populations in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I agree completely with what Senator Hayes said about giving space to the victims but I welcome the opportunities now at last being given in the judicial system to give a voice to victims in the courtroom and to have a victim impact assessment within the courtroom to allow people to say what is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">We have discussed this issue on many occasions. There was a discussion at an early stage of this Government in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform — I am sure the Leader will correct me if I am wrong — said it was being considered that the victims in rape cases, for instance, might have legal representation in the courtroom during the course of their hearing. That measure would be welcomed and would be in line with the comments made by Senator Brian Hayes. It might be worthwhile having a discussion on these issues outside this particular case——</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_12">——because it is a broader issue which arises every time there is a victim in a court case.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I would like to add to that an issue which I have raised three or four times over the past few months, namely, the question of serving of sentences. When people are given concurrent sentences the method of calculating time off and parole should be completely different from that involving people who are serving one sentence. If a person is serving 250 years, the same system should not be used to determine parole as would be used for somebody serving ten or 12 years. We should have a broad debate on the justice issue and I know the Minister would have much to say on these matters. He has expressed views in private on many occasions and we could gain a good deal from such a debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_14">I support Senators Brian Hayes and O'Toole in their calls for measures to address the needs of victims in the criminal justice system. Without making any judgment on the case, the family of Brian Murphy raised valid concerns about their experience in the court. It is something that was discussed already in the House when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was here. There is a need for much more to be done in terms of victim support within the criminal justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I do not agree with Senator O'Toole that the courts are not the place for justice. I would have thought that was their objective. To be fair to the justice system——</p>

          <p eId="para_18">I would like the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to be invited to the House to discuss again the Hanly report on staffing proposals in the medical service. In particular, I would like the critique raised at a conference in Kildare over the weekend to be explored, which criticises some of the evidence and conclusions of the Hanly report. Major steps are proposed in the Hanly report and it is important that the Government does not rush in, blindfolded, and adopt its conclusions lock, stock and barrel. Members of this House have a contribution to make as regards its proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">I join with the general sentiment expressed across the House with regard to the rights of victims of crime to have their voices heard. It took a remarkable act of courage and determination on the part of Mr. and Mrs. Murphy to speak at yesterday's court hearing. While it is correct that we should not comment on the trial, it has struck me for some time as extraordinary that court proceedings and tribunals are not televised. That view has been supported by a member of the Judiciary in one case with regard to tribunals. It is a charade that we have to listen to actors on the radio at night using the words that were spoken. Why can we not hear the people themselves and their words?</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_28">Following a report circulated by RGDATA on what it describes as "ghost town Britain", it is important to invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to the House to debate the action needed to avoid "ghost town Ireland". I am concerned at the great number of small rural post offices, shops and other business outlets that are closing down in rural Ireland on a weekly basis. It is important to have a debate on the issue. Large stores are starting to dominate at the expense of small enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">The Hanly report was raised by Senator Tuffy. I wonder whether a second Hanly report was launched at the weekend, because there was a great deal of backtracking on the original report. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has backtracked on the downgrading of accident and emergency units in two thirds of the country's hospitals. That is welcome on this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">As regards what Senator Dardis had to say on the opening of Croke Park, I would welcome it——</p>

          <p eId="para_32">Yesterday the first national playground policy document was launched by the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The surveys were carried out by the national children's committee, which highlighted the lack of play facilities throughout the country, only 168 playgrounds having been provided by local authorities. As eight Departments are involved in the implementation of those plans, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to discuss the policy.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_21">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_33">I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators Brian Hayes and O'Toole. This court case is a tragic circumstance for all the young people and families involved, and I do not intend to comment on it. However, behind that case is a significant culture of alcohol, and this House should address it again. We had a good debate on it at one point during the anniversary celebrations of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, at which some people laugh but which was very necessary in the 19th century and may well be necessary again. If one examines the statistics just released, one sees that Ireland has the highest level of alcohol consumption in the European Union. The problem is particularly prevalent among young women. Perhaps we might consider the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I would also like something to be done about the fact that several of the joint committees have developed a habit of starting their business at a time that coincides with the Order of Business in this House. That is disrespectful to the Cathaoirleach and the Seanad. It happened today with the Joint Committee on Transport. I went there only because I was asked.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">It also happened with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the Leader and I have suggested that we might, as a Chamber, boycott those committees on one occasion so that they simply cannot meet. They are treating this House and the Cathaoirleach with disrespect.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Perhaps we might also have a debate on foreign affairs, particularly the extraordinary behaviour of the United States of America in kidnapping the democratically elected president of a small Caribbean country. It is now clear from the press conference that, after a good deal of pressure, President Aristide was allowed to stay in the Central African Republic, but he was kidnapped. They were playing the same tricks in Venezuela, where they were caught by a very fine Irish television company with their hand in the jam. Now they are trying exactly the same trick again, and among their evidence is the claim that there is an Islamic threat. General James Hill, the chief of the US southern command, said the proof of the danger of Islamic terrorism was supplied by US citizens resident on Isla de Margarita, who reported a sudden increase in the number of young Muslims living on the island. It is a frightening thought that the Americans would use that as the basis for undermining a democratic government.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">Perhaps we might invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the House. His brief is so wide that he could be here on a raft of different subjects, particularly regarding the communications end of his portfolio. I say that for two reasons, the first being the weekend reports on the state of this country's fixed-line infrastructure. Apparently a secret report has been prepared, which even ComReg has not seen. As the company is supposed to be floated on the Stock Exchange, it is timely that we try to flesh that out and get more information on it. The second reason concerns the roll-out of broadband. That has been likened to the previous rural electrification scheme, so important is it to the country, particularly bearing in mind the Minister's commitment of last Saturday regarding group broadband schemes, which would mirror group water schemes. It would be useful to invite the Minister to the House to provide more information on that.</p>

At a conference in Dublin over the weekend it was mentioned that local hospitals will retain 24-hour cover and that regional hospitals will receive more specialised services.

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_46">I support the call of Senators Brian Hayes, O'Toole and Tuffy for a debate on the issues arising in the area of justice, particularly the role of victims in the administration of justice. The members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights participated in public hearings last December on the criminal justice system. The committee's report, which would have been issued by now but for the ongoing public inquiry, will probably be issued shortly. A debate on justice would provide an opportunity to debate it. Other issues, such as the suspended sentences being handed down in rape cases, give rise to concern in this area. A good debate would encompass these and other issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">I also support Senator Kenneally's call for a debate on communications. The Eircom IPO presents an opportunity to discuss such issues. Apart from the matters mentioned by the Senator, we could also debate the delay in the installation of telephones in certain parts of the country where the problem seems to have gone back to the bad old days.</p>

We can move away from the reactive issues which we always talk about in regard to Northern Ireland when there is a punishment beating or political impasse. While the symbolism of checkpoints has been removed along the Border, we still have social and economic partition. We must devise a concrete connecting policy between the North and the South which is something we do not have at present. This requires the collective will of people on both sides of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">The Coleraine to Derry railway link is under threat and it looks likely that it will close. People are seriously worried about this possibility as it is both a tourist and economic route. We need to use the spatial strategy to promote a rail link between Derry and Letterkenny. When the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, was last in the House he said he would incorporate the development of this link into his transport strategy. If we showed the will on our side perhaps that would help to maintain the threatened Coleraine to Derry link.</p>

The North-South bodies are still in existence, as are the economic problems, and such a debate would be most helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">I also support the request for a debate on the role of victims in society. As Senator Walsh suggested, this would be better in the context of the justice committee's report rather than in the present heightened atmosphere. I do not wish to comment on any recent cases, but they do give us an opportunity to reflect on what we all owe to juries and the service people give on our behalf. They are ordinary people dealing with extremely complex and disturbing situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">I would welcome a debate on hospital policy generally. Much nonsense is talked about what patients want when, by and large, patients want to get better. It might be helpful if some statistics from small hospitals around the country were made known in order that we can learn where patients have a greater chance of getting better.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">Last weekend there was another gangland-style murder and an attack. While we have become complacent about this type of activity, which has almost become a weekly occurrence, it is a serious issue. We need the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House and outline his response to this type of killing. While drugs play an important part in this problem other issues are also involved. The Minister is not on top of the problem. People are afraid to walk the streets at night because they encounter danger. The Minister needs to reassure us about his response to these murders. People are going around with guns in their pockets. Where are they getting them? The Minister needs to address this multifaceted issue in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">Will the Leader intervene with the Minister for Transport and Irish Rail regarding the state of carriages on the Westport and Ballina railway lines? On a number of occasions the dining car has been taken away and there is no breakfast buffet, nor are there first-class carriages. The line is being treated in the same way as the national primary road, the N5. The users of this road and the railway route are being treated as second-class citizens. I ask the Leader to intervene and meet Iarnród Éireann or the Minister for Transport regarding this matter. It is very serious that a second-class, substandard service is being provided.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">In recent years there have been considerable improvements to the Sligo line and the signalling system, but there is no point having a dual carriageway if one does not have a car to drive on it. The state of the rolling stock in the west is a disgrace and harks back to the 1950s. The 90 carriages bought recently by Iarnród Éireann should not be reserved for Cork and the more profitable rail routes. If proper infrastructure were in place, people would use it and the service would therefore become more profitable.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">Senator Brian Hayes, as Leader of the Opposition, spoke in very careful, measured terms about the lessons we can learn from a particular case. I know we are not supposed to comment on the case but I believe the family in question was enormously brave. Can one imagine any woman having to speak as Mrs. Murphy did? Her words were incredibly courageous. The Senator referred to the need for victims to receive a progress report on their case and on delays. It appears that progress reports are not issued in cases of the kind in question, but it would be very useful if they were.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The Senator also referred to the size of courtrooms. Many are in very old buildings, which are not custom-made and cannot cater for huge crowds. Everybody is cheek by jowl in many very large cases, which must make it extraordinarily difficult for people to do their business, particularly when there are emotional matters involved as there are in any case. The Senator called for a general debate on these matters. I am not referring to yesterday's case in saying that victim impact statements, which were introduced some years ago, are a good idea. They allow victims to go through a process of catharsis in which they can say what they want.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Senator Brian Hayes put forward very practical points. Senator O'Toole made the point that courts are never the place for justice, a point taken up by Senator Tuffy. When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is in the House on Thursday, we can ask him if he will participate in a debate on the broader matters referred to and on sentencing policies. Senator Tuffy said a balanced system of justice is needed. There will be people for and against whatever sentence is passed. That is why judges have such an important role to play because the responsibility for making decisions in cases such as this rests upon their shoulders. The Senator also wants the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss the Hanly report and its current position.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Senator Dardis agrees with Senator Brian Hayes and he wants trials and tribunals to be televised. I do not know whether that is a good idea. It is very American but perhaps it is appropriate to modern times. He would also like a debate on a forbidden subject, the GAA.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">Senator Bannon referred to the RGDATA report. I read the booklet about "ghost town Britain" but it did not refer to post offices, it was about large out-of-town shopping centres, saying that people want a return to smaller shopping enclaves. He too wanted a debate on the Hanly report.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">Senator Brennan referred to the first national playground document. I will ask the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss it. Many urban areas are keen to have access to or to provide money for play areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">Senator Norris talked about drinking. No.13 on the Order Paper states: "Statements on the high level of alcohol consumption by young people (<i>resumed</i>)”. There was an item on the news this morning about a EUROSTAT report to the effect that the Irish are the greatest imbibers in Europe. I do not know whether this research includes wine which is taken with many meals in other countries. Women were cited again as a bad example, which is unfair because I do not meet many women who drink to excess. Perhaps they are doing it and we do not know about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">Senator Paddy Burke spoke about the state of train carriages. The lines and signalling have been substantially upgraded. To undergo a long journey without refreshments of a most basic nature is punishment in itself.

          <p eId="para_106">It is proposed to introduce a register of tobacco retailers. Will the Minister consider giving guidelines to the health boards regarding the practice established by them over many years of using minors to attempt to purchase tobacco products in shops in order to find out how effective is the legislation? I spoke on this on Second Stage. As a member of a health board, I have objected strenuously over the years to this practice. We see headlines on local papers stating that a person was fined for selling tobacco products to minors. However, the method by which they were found out was through trapping them by sending a health board official accompanied by a young person into the shop to establish whether the young person could purchase particular products. It is time to operate the legislation in some way other than by using minors because it is an abuse. 
   The Minister should indicate to the health boards, agencies and statutory bodies which have responsibility for implementing the legislation that they should desist from using minors in this way.</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_107">To be fair to all concerned, there may not be an easy alternative mode. There has been a major push in recent years since we increased the age limit to 18. We wanted to bring across a strong culture of compliance in order to try to stop minors from smoking or to reduce what are termed "initiation rates". The most recent national lifestyles survey shows that we had arrested the rate at which young people actually start smoking. That is the key battleground for the future. Many retailers are co-operating and are anxious to be seen to be doing so. The next issue that arises, therefore, is that of a level playing pitch. If some retailers are adhering to the law and they hear about a particular retailer who is not doing so, the whole system can be called into question and it means that some retailers will be disadvantaged on competition grounds, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">I will contact the health boards and discuss the modalities they employ in respect of enforcement in the area of under-age smoking. Surveys and research have been carried out with regard to how under-age smokers secure cigarettes, particularly in terms of different types of selling and retailing.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">I understand from where the Senator is coming on this matter. On the other hand, the health boards that are using this modality are probably using a system that is foolproof. If a young person goes into a shop and is sold cigarettes without any checking being done, someone is clearly in breach of the law.</p>

Will the Minister comment on the section? As he is aware, large numbers of illegal cigarette sales take place in this country on a daily basis. Some of this behaviour is funded directly by paramilitary organisations. Will Members on this side of the House applaud the Minister's efforts to bring about much greater certainty in this area in terms of retail outlets etc? What discussions has he had with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in respect of illegal sales? One need only visit Mary Street, Grafton Street and Henry Street to witness the number of illegal sales of cigarettes to people of all descriptions. A significant percentage of tobacco sales, particularly in working class communities, comes from illegal trading and this must be countered. While the Minister is doing everything he can in this Bill to bring about order in the retail sector and to give a clear signal to the public about where we stand on this issue, significant numbers of cigarette sales are illegal. We must be aware of and try to counter this.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">Tobacco can only be sold by bona fide traders with a licence. It is a sure bet to say that none of those people selling on the street has any licence, nor are they paying rates or other overheads. They would not be too concerned about the age group to which they are selling and I do not carry any candle for them. That tobacco is a very dangerous product has already been debated here, in the Lower House and in the medical profession so there is no need to go down that road again. I would ban the street trading of cigarettes because it is a known fact that many of those cigarettes come from sources that are not consistent with the rule of law. If I were the Minister for Health and Children or indeed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I would stop it forthwith.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">Smuggling is a heinous crime in itself and runs counter to what we are trying to do to achieve a smoke-free society. I have had consultations with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Minister and the Garda have had some significant successes, especially in recent times with major hauls of smuggled tobacco used for illegal trading. The stronger we can clamp down on this, the better and this Bill gives us additional powers to do so. That is only fair to the licensed retail trader who pays taxes and rates. The Garda and the Customs and Excise have had some successes and continue to be vigilant, as this type of crime is related to other types of criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Senator Quinn spoke about subsection (10) on sales promotion devices. This subsection tries to avoid a situation where a trader deliberately reduces the price to encourage increased sales. There have been significant sales promotions of alcohol which have affected alcohol consumption and alcohol related harm. We do not want the same thing to happen in the context of cigarette smoking.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">This is a standard legal provision in terms of public health legislation; a similar provision applies in the case of food safety legislation. The Senator's amendments propose that only one person, an occupier, manager or other person in charge, be held responsible for ensuring compliance with public health measures. In taking proceedings for an offence under this section, an environmental health officer will take into account the details of the case and it may, perhaps, be necessary to initiate proceedings against each of the persons responsible or only one of them. The chain of command and lines of communication in businesses can vary significantly. If, for example, the owner of a specified place is not in the specified place at the time of the alleged offence, then he or she will remain responsible for ensuring the person left in charge was aware of public health legislation and was instructed to take all reasonable steps to ensure compliance.</p>

It is a matter of building compliance with owners and employers throughout the country so that they ensure authorised officers work with them in terms of the no smoking agenda, as they already do in the area of food safety. It will not be a case of trying to nab people on the first day of the ban.

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_156">Subsection (7) is broad and I wish the section gave more protection to non-smokers in institutions. I am well aware the Bill gives effect to a workplace directive and that is what the Minister had to consider in introducing it. I did not table an amendment to this section because I did not believe that it could be enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">However, hotel and guesthouse premises should ensure that the vast majority of their rooms are non-smoking because most people do not want to smoke in their bedrooms. It is bad if a non-smoker has to take a room in a hotel that was previously occupied by a smoker. I do not know if the Minister can bring in regulations, or whether they would have to be brought in by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, to provide that hotels and guesthouses must have an adequate supply of non-smoking rooms. Sometimes one finds that the supply of rooms available is 50:50 in terms of smoking and non-smoking. However, 50% of people do not want to smoke in their bedrooms and if people smoke in them, the smoke lingers for a long time. I do not know if the Minister can do anything in that regard, but it is an important consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The inmates of nursing homes are in a vulnerable position if one or two people insist on puffing away in the one living room that is shared by a number of people. The smokers might ask whether the other people mind if they smoke but it is difficult when people are living in a home atmosphere to say they do mind. If they object, they may be considered spoilsports, but such smoking affects their health. Elderly people frequently have chest problems. One or two people may be able to impose their wills on the other members who are living in a nursing home who simply out of politeness feel they cannot object. I wish this section was tougher in respect of smoking regulations, although I appreciate the Minister had difficulties with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">Some people suffering from mental illness become seriously addicted to cigarette smoking, but that does not mean that everyone in psychiatric hospitals is addicted. Non-smokers in psychiatric hospitals have to sit in the same environment as people who are heavy smokers, as Senator Glynn would be aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The same position applies in prisons. I hope this section will be carefully examined to ensure the rights of non-smokers are brought to the fore. A prison is one's home while one is it. Sometimes three people may share a cell and if one of them is a smoker, I do not know what the other two can do in terms of this legislation, apart from throwing water over him or her every now and then which happens in prison anyway. I wish this section was much tougher on smoking regulations, although I realise the Minister had difficulty with it. Significant numbers of non-smokers, workers and people who have to live in these places, will be affected by tobacco smoke. Some of them may have chest problems and they should not be exposed to such smoke. In the case of nursing homes with perhaps only one day room, non-smokers will have to endure smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">I am not sure if the Minister can ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to monitor this area in the hotel sector. I stayed in a hotel in Cork, the name of which I will tell the Minister later, where the staff could not find me a room that had not been occupied by smokers. The hotel was fairly well occupied, but it did not have a big enough supply of non-smoking rooms. We are doing quite well in getting people to stop smoking. Many smokers do not want to smoke in bedrooms or in living quarters. I hope the Minister carefully examines this section and does his best to encourage his colleagues in this area to enforce the legislation as strongly as possible and to ensure that people within institutions are properly protected.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_111">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_162">My point relates to Senator Henry's comments. My daughter and I checked into a hotel recently. My daughter requested a non-smoking room, but found there was a strong smell of smoke in her room. She was successful in demanding a change of room, unlike in Senator Henry's case. There is a danger in trying to solve everything by way of legislation as to a large extent the marketplace will solve such problems. If a person experiences a problem in getting a non-smoking room in a hotel, that person will probably not stay in that hotel again.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The Minister has had difficulty with this section because of the exceptions that have been made. If we set something in stone in this legislation, what difficulty would that pose for the Minister in later seeking to strengthen or perhaps even weaken some of the regulations made? Paragraph 47(8)(<i>d</i>) of the principal Act states that a prison is any part of a Garda Síochána station used for the detention of persons. I am not sure what that means, but I would not be surprised that almost any part of a Garda station could be used for the detention of persons and, therefore, an exception to the provision could be made on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">It would be wise to review every piece of legislation every five years to ascertain whether it is working, although that may be unworkable. However, I would like this legislation to be reviewed at a later date to avoid the Minister having to introduce a new Bill. Perhaps there is another way of dealing with changes the Minister may wish to make to some of the regulations. There was a good deal of thinking, adjustment and realignment on this section. I hope it will achieve what the Minister set out to achieve, but if it does not, I would like to think that we could review it at some point in the future without necessarily having to introduce a new Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_112" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_165">I thank the Senators for their comments. The background to this section is that the common denominator in these exemptions is that they apply to a dwelling place. We indicated in November that we would notify regulations to Brussels in the context of providing for such exemptions. When we had a three hour discussion on the then published regulations in the other House, many Deputies on all sides raised the point that exemptions from the regulations should be put in place in regard to institutions such as psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes and hotels. To give legal certainty to that, we have put these provisions in the Bill. I retained a team of senior counsel, through the Attorney General's office, to advise me every step of the way on this issue with a view to the future. I was advised that the most effective and robust way to protect the overall edifice of the smoke-free policy was to insert these provisions in this detail in the body of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">In the context of health and safety legislation, a clause has always been provided that allowed for a different approach to the implementation of such legislation in the prison environment because of other competing issues such as control, order and so forth. Such a clause has always been included in health and safety legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">The key point is that an exemption does not mean a free for all policy. Every employer and owner of a premises or nursing home still has an obligation to protect his or her employees from the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke. In regard to the health institutions that will come under the Department of Health and Children and the health boards, we will insist on a strong, robust provision under that heading in terms of protecting the employees and the other inhabitants of such residences. In other words, it is not a matter of saying that one is exempted from the legislation and can do what one likes. That is certainly not the case. Clear protocols will be established to protect employees in such a situation. Some of those institutions have already managed to do that. Even in the psychiatric area there are one or two examples where outdoor facilities have been created.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Under the original Bill and regulations, a dwelling, as in a private home and so on, was not covered. This created a dilemma in terms of someone living in a nursing home for the past five or ten years and whether that should be regarded as their home. In some of the community residences I visited recently no one can smoke in any of the communal areas. I spoke to the Mental Health Commission and there is no reason that shelters cannot be built with the 50% exposure in the garden, back yard or whatever to facilitate people smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The Irish Hotels Federation's position to us is that approximately 75% of hotel bedrooms are now smoke free. Most guesthouses are entirely smoke free. Many of them do not want to facilitate or encourage smoking for other reasons — fire, damage to furniture, beds and so forth. I do not see a huge issue in regard to guesthouses, and I never did. I considered that they were ahead of the game, but the problem is consistency across the board. Once we go down the road we have to dot the i's and cross the t's in terms of making sure there is consistency with respect to legislation. The key point is that the presence of exempted areas do not absolve businesses or establishments from any responsibilities towards employees or inhabitants. Employers still have responsibilities and we will be pushing home that point strongly in terms of issuing of guidance and so forth.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_170">On the section, I agree with much of what Senator Henry had to say about hotel bedrooms. We have all had the experience of being given what was supposed to be a non-smoking room only to find on entering that somebody had been smoking in it. That is a matter for the people using the room, however, rather than forcing the hotel staff to monitor the position and ensure that people do not smoke. I accept what Senator Quinn said. The market eventually will decide these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">There is another aspect on which I would like the Minister's observation. It is to do with section 16(7)(<i>d</i>), which refers to “an outdoor part of a place or premises covered by a fixed or movable roof, provided that not more than 50 per cent of the perimeter of that part is surrounded by one or more walls.” It appears to exclude sporting stadiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I had the privilege of travelling to Australia for the Rugby World Cup and at both the International Rules match in the Melbourne cricket ground and the Ireland-Australia match in the Telstra Dome in Melbourne, there was a smoking ban in operation. We were reminded before the game started, at half time and at the end of the game that they were non-smoking stadia. There is a universal ban in restaurants and so on in New South Wales; one has to go outside to smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Last Saturday was a day to be remembered in Twickenham but one of the difficulties is that if one is sitting in a stadium, one has absolutely no choice about moving if the person in front is smoking. There is nothing one can do to move whereas in almost every other circumstance one can move. Is it stretching matters too much to think that at some stage we might have a smoking ban in sporting stadia?</p>

          <p eId="para_175">I agree with Senator Dardis. Most stadia in England have a smoking ban in place. I do not know whether it is from a health point of view or whatever but it is something we could examine here. For example, those who light up in the Glasgow Celtic ground are ejected.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_116" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_176">I have sympathy with the Senators but to be fair, from day one we were clear that we did not envisage outdoor areas being covered by the smoking ban. With respect to the debate that has taken place over the past 12 months on an enclosed smoking ban and the virtues or otherwise of ventilation, it would have been difficult to put forward the argument that in the open air smoke is as bad for one as it is in an enclosed room. That is not in any way to detract from what both Senators have said. It can be a particularly difficult proposition for non-smokers to be watching a game with smoke wafting in front of them or to their side, but they are in the open air.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">I am encouraged by the positive views from both Houses of the Oireachtas, which have been supportive and effective in terms of pushing through this measure and bringing about the societal change in behaviour. If we did not have cross-party support on this issue, the Minister of the day would be susceptible to people in one party trying to play off those in another and trying to undermine them whereas we have had a good fair wind, with people trying to test the legislation and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">As Senator Quinn said, we will evaluate this legislation. We can always review it and come back to the Houses to amend it or include other places in the future. We should look for consensus on this issue and there are good signs that consensus is developing. I welcome the statement from the licensed vintners last week that they will co-operate with the law. Many people want to do that now and the vast majority of the public are behind it. If we can build a consensus perhaps we can move on incrementally and, in time, the sporting organisations may also examine the issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_179">I thank the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Callely and O'Malley, for their co-operation and assistance. In particular I commend the Minister on his Trojan work in this whole area. He met many areas of resistance but he took them on the chin and forged ahead. I thank the Opposition — the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Independent group — for their co-operation in this Chamber. That consensus approach is a testament to the importance of this matter to all Members of both Houses. I wish the legislation well and I am sure that generations to come will approve of the action taken in this House today.</p>

          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_180">I also thank the Minister. We have spoken on this issue many times. As someone who never smoked I ran a public house up to ten years ago. One of the reasons I retired was because I felt I was being affected by passive smoking. The one issue that was not conclusive was ventilation. While it was not proven that ventilation in pubs could have done away with passive smoking I was concerned that much money was being spent on the insertion of vents in public houses. I felt that with other legislation on the horizon publicans should not have to go to this expense when ultimately it did not matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I pay tribute to the Minister. I attended a convention on cannabis smoking and it highlighted for me the dangers of tobacco smoking because more people have died from smoking tobacco — including passive smoking — than were killed in the two world wars of the last century. Tobacco has only been a feature of modern day society for little over 200 years. This legislation is welcome. Anything that gets rid of the blight of the harmful effects of tobacco is good.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_182">No matter what the vintners will say, human life will still continue in this country, on foot of this legislation. I am delighted to see it passed and that this is the first country to bring in such legislation. I am sure others will follow. One thing that concerns me, however, is the EUROSTAT figures on the intake of drink in this country, published this morning. They are serious. They included wine and this is worrying. If pubs are now more pleasant places to visit, our only worry is that people will spend more time there. That is a matter for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I have a vested interest. My father died of lung cancer when he was 60. He was a fit man who was smoking in the days when nobody knew anything was the matter with it. He had stopped some five years before he died, perhaps because he did not think it was good for his health. We did not know then what we know now and I am delighted with this legislation. This has been a Bill in which the Minister has had more support, I believe, from this side of the House than his own side. I hope it will be a big success. Like others I believe it will be enforced by the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The Minister said that 75% of patrons in hotels do not smoke. I am surprised that it is not as high as 90%, because the number of people who want to smoke in them appears to be small. The Minister had a tough time with the legislation. It would take a Cork person to stand up that that sort of carry-on. That is another vested interest coming out. I offer the Minister my congratulations.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_185">As Leader of the House, I would like to add my voice to the tributes made by Senators. I was thinking back to 1987 when as Minister for Health, the current Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil, Deputy O'Hanlon, introduced a Bill on the advertising of tobacco which had been originally mooted by his predecessor, former Deputy Barry Desmond. I vividly recall the evening in the Dáil when a cross-party consensus on the matter was arrived at. It was highly interesting. It has taken a further 17 years for us to arrive at this point. The hiccoughs and lacunas that developed were no harm. In that period opposition to the proposed measure had been gung-ho but, following a more tranquil interval because of various technical matters the fight was gone out of the other side when the initiative re-emerged. It was as if it had absorbed the facts and the lessons and taken on board what customers and the general public were saying. The Bill was more calmly received.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">In social terms, often when one is attempting to achieve something that involves controversy, it is more effective to allow a breathing space in this way for the message to sink in. People grow weary of a topic and publicans got tired of hearing that they were all going to go out of business and facing bankruptcy because no one would be going into their pubs. All I hear people saying is that they can now go into pubs because they will be able to breathe and will not have smelly clothes etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">My late husband smoked for 20 years of his married life. He had, of course, smoked before that. Then he stopped, went "cold turkey" one night and never smoked again without the aid of drugs, patches or anything. He just stopped. My mother used to say he was a resolute man to do that. Long before it was commonly known that people could die from smoking, he decided that one could and he took the initiative. He passed on, eventually, but not from smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">People now realise the painful and harmful effect smoking can have on their health. Why set out to kill oneself? That is madness. I never smoked, so I can afford to talk like this. Why should one set out to damage one's health? To open a package which says "Smoking can damage your health" and then to proceed to smoke is stupid. Everybody will be far healthier and far better humoured. I say to the Minister, "well done". One has to stand up for one what believes in, but it is amazing what can happen when the lacuna disappears.</p>

The cross-party support and that of Independents generally in both Houses was extremely welcome. I would also like to thank the Leader of the House and her office for their help and assistance, particularly as regards the early signature motion and for the smooth passage of the Bill through the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The Minister for Health and Children must be the main advocate for public health. If the incumbent of this office is not then we are in a bad way as a country and as a society. I would like to think the younger generation will look back in years to come and ask: "Did they actually smoke in the workplace? Did they actually smoke in pubs?" Then I will know that what we did today was a success and an achievement.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">Is cúis mhór áthais dom bheith anseo i measc na Seanadóirí chun an Bille Aerloingseoireachta agus Aeriompair 
  (Coinbhinsiúin Idirnáisiúnta) 2004 a chur faoi bhráid an tSeanaid. Ba mhaith liom leithscéal a ghabháil thar ceann mo chomhghleacaithe polaitiúla, an tAire, an Teachta Brennan agus an tAire Stáit, an Teachta McDaid, atá lasmuigh den tír ag obair le hUachtaránacht na hEorpa.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Before moving on to the detailed provisions of this Bill and the Montreal Convention, which the Bill enables us to ratify, it is useful to place it in the correct context. Aviation is first and foremost an international activity. As far back as 1929, when the first Warsaw Convention was adopted, it was clear that international agreement was needed to facilitate the smooth operation of air transport. Even during the extremely difficult international circumstances of the Second World War, nations came together in 1944 to adopt the Chicago Convention, which created the International Civil Aviation Organisation and still serves as the framework for the conduct of worldwide civil aviation. We in Ireland have always recognised the importance of international aviation to our economy because we are an island on the western periphery of Europe, and because of our deep business and historical links with North America over the centuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">We have participated fully in the development of international aviation and its various international conventions. Owing to our location on the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean, we played a pivotal role in the early development of transatlantic aviation, and Ireland continues to enjoy a strong reputation in the international aviation community. The purpose of the Bill is to enable us to ratify the 1999 Montreal Convention along with our European Community colleagues. That convention is a further milestone in the co-operative development of international aviation, and it is right that Ireland should support it and continue our tradition of support for international aviation.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">In the course of preparing the Bill, the opportunity has been taken to restate the existing law relating to the existing Warsaw Convention and its amendments so that the entire subject is covered in one Bill. The Montreal Convention is an updated replacement for the 1929 Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, which, together with numerous subsequent amendments, is referred to as the Warsaw system. The Warsaw system now provides a worldwide system of standards and rules for carriage by air, and in particular common rules on liability limits for the carriage of passengers, cargo and baggage in the event of damage, delay or loss. The Warsaw system is already enshrined in Irish law in the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936, as amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">The Montreal Convention represents a major improvement over the liability regime established under the Warsaw Convention and its related instruments relative to passenger rights in the event of an accident. Among other benefits, the convention holds carriers strictly liable for damages up to 100,000 special drawing rights; removes the upper limit on damages for accident victims which exists in the Warsaw system; extends the range of jurisdictions in which claims for damages may be brought; clarifies the duties and obligations of carriers engaged in code-share operations; and, with respect to cargo, provides for modernised documentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Significantly for passengers, the convention makes it easier for them to bring legal action. In addition to the jurisdictions in which legal action for damages may now be taken under the Warsaw system, the Montreal Convention allows legal action to be taken in the state where the passenger lives if the carrier operates services to or from that state. That will, in almost all cases, allow the passenger to take legal action in the courts with which he or she is most familiar.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The new Montreal Convention will supersede the Warsaw system in every state which implements it. However, the Warsaw system will continue to apply to international air travel where either or both of the states has not yet ratified the Montreal Convention. The Bill deals with that by providing that the most recent convention common to both Ireland and another state will apply to air travel to or from that state. The rules of the Montreal Convention are already included in European law for all European airlines and their passengers through EU regulations. Ratification of the Montreal Convention will extend the higher liability limits worldwide, thereby providing very significant benefits for passengers travelling with non-EU airlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Ratification of the Montreal Convention by all EU member states and the European Community before 1 May 2004 will ensure the Montreal Convention will automatically extend to the ten accession countries when they become members on 1 May 2004. Otherwise, the process will be delayed until all ten accession countries are able to ratify, and Ireland, as the current holder of the Presidency of the European Union, would not wish to delay the passage of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill. Sections 1 to 3 contain standard provisions in legislation, the Short Title, the purpose of the Act and the various interpretations. Section 4 provides for the two versions of the Warsaw Convention and the new Montreal Conventions to have the force of law in Ireland. The first two are already enshrined in Irish law in the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936. The texts are set out in the three Schedules to the Bill. The provisions in the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936, which enshrine the first two conventions, are repealed in section 11 of this Bill. That means all the legislation in the area will be conveniently included in one Act. Section 5 provides for the French language to prevail if there is a dispute about differences between the English and the original French texts of the Warsaw system conventions. Those conventions were originally drafted only in French, and the original French texts are deposited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Poland.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Section 6 empowers the Government to certify which states are contracting parties to this convention. Section 7 sets out the liabilities of a carrier if a passenger dies, and specifies who is entitled to claim compensation. It is based on section 18 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936, as amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Section 8 empowers the Minister to make a notification, as provided for in Article 57 of the Montreal Convention. That article allows a state to declare that the convention will not apply to international flights carried out by the state for non-commercial purposes, or to military flights. There are no immediate plans to make such notifications. However, it is customary in international aviation to treat "state aircraft" separately from civilian aircraft. Section 9 empowers the Minister to extend the convention to apply to internal non-international flights. In practice, internal flights are already subject to equivalent provisions through EU law.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Section 10 is a standard provision authorising money to be provided by the Oireachtas. It is not expected that the Act will give rise to any additional costs for the Minister. Section 11 repeals certain provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936 and includes some consequential amendments to ensure that this new Act will be taken into account, when appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">As the purpose of this Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the Montreal Convention, I will give some background to the convention and describe its main provisions. The Montreal Convention represents the successful culmination of work by the International Civil Aviation Organisation to modernise the patchwork of liability regimes around the world. Currently, air carriers operating to countries that are not EU member states are faced with widely differing liability regimes, depending on the treaties to which various governments are parties. Many private inter-carrier agreements further complicate matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The success of the Montreal Convention is clearly illustrated by the fact that it was immediately signed by 52 countries, including many EU member states of which Ireland was one in 2000. In November last, the United States became the 30th country to ratify the convention, thereby causing it to enter into force among the states that have ratified it.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">As soon as the Montreal Convention is ratified by Ireland, by the other EU member states and by the Community, it will become part of European law and will take precedence over the Warsaw Convention and any of its amendments and related instruments.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Chapter 1 covers the general provisions of the convention and deals mainly with who and what is covered by it. Chapter 2 deals with both the documentation and duties of the parties relating to the carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Articles 3 to 11 of the convention, deal with the documentation requirements for international air carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo. Most significantly, they provide benefits to the cargo industry by providing for modernised electronic documentation, including the elimination of the need for consignors of cargo to complete detailed air waybills prior to consigning goods to a carrier. Consignors may use simplified electronic records to facilitate shipments, thereby expediting the movement of goods.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Chapter 3 of the convention deals with the liability of the carrier and the extent of compensation for damage. Article 21 provides for compensation in the case of death or injury of passengers. First, the carrier will be strictly liable for the first 100,000 SDRs, or approximately €118,000 of proven damages for each passenger. This is a big increase from the approximate 16,600 SDRs, approximately €20,000, under the Warsaw system. A carrier may not avoid liability for this amount, even if the carrier can prove that the harm was not caused by its negligence. This means that even if an accident was caused by weather or if a third party, such as a terrorist, caused an accident, the carrier is still liable for damages up to 100,000 SDRs. The only way a carrier can exonerate itself from this liability is if it can prove that the passenger for whom the damages are sought, caused or contributed to the accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">In addition to the amount of 100,000 SDRs, carriers are subject to unlimited liability if the plaintiff can show that the carrier was negligent. This is a major change from the Warsaw system, which placed a low upper limit of 16,600 SDRs on the amount of damages, except in very unlikely cases where it could be proved that the carrier or its staff intentionally or recklessly caused the accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">As these limits are already in force in Ireland under European law, there are no cost implications for Irish air carriers. Also, under European law all European air carriers must insure themselves sufficiently to meet these liability limits. Consequently, ratification of this convention will not increase costs for carriers in Europe, nor will it lead to increased fares for passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Article 28 provides for advance payments, which acknowledges the right of states to have national laws that require their own carriers to make such payments in the event of passenger death or injury, and addresses certain procedural issues related to such payments. In addition, a resolution adopted by the diplomatic conference, as part of the final Act, encourages all states to adopt such laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">European law already provides for advance payments of the type referred to in Article 28. Amounts of at least 16,000 SDRs, approximately €19,000, are to be made without delay to persons entitled to make claims to meet immediate financial needs. These advance payments do not involve an admission of liability and may be offset against the total amount of damages payable.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Articles 29 to 35 provide for rules relating to the basis for making claims and include a new provision allowing persons to bring actions in the state where the passenger lives, if the carrier operates services to or from that State. Disputes may also be settled by arbitration.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Chapter 4 of the convention deals with combined carriage. This is where a person or cargo makes a journey partly by air and partly by surface transport. In that case the convention only applies to carriage by air. Chapter 5 deals with carriage by air performed by a person other than the contracting carrier. This is primarily to cover what is known as "code-sharing" among airlines. Code-sharing is where airline "A" agrees to carry passengers on behalf of airline "B" and the tickets issued by airline "B" carry its flight number. This has become a very common arrangement among airlines as it allows much wider international marketing by, for example, linking internal US flights by US airlines with Aer Lingus's transatlantic flights. Senators have heard about the one world alliance to which this is related.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">When a claim arises under the convention, a claimant may take an action against the carrier from which the carriage was purchased or against the code-sharing carrier operating the aircraft at the time of the accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Chapter 6 of the convention deals with other provisions, such as nullifying clauses in contracts that do not comply with the convention and which require insurance. Chapter 7 contains the final clauses, covering such matters as signature, ratification and entry into force. Article 53 includes provision to allow regional economic integration organisations, such as the European Community, to ratify the convention on a macro basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The provisions I have described reflect the many benefits that will accrue under the convention to the air transportation industry, especially its many consumers. One key benefit, not reflected in the provisions, is the benefit of uniformity. Based upon the response to the convention at the diplomatic conference and on communications with other governments since that time, Irish ratification of this convention, which will allow EU ratification by 1 May of this year, will help to achieve a much-needed and long sought after modernisation and unification of the liability regime applicable to international air carriers.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_224">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit. Fine Gael welcomes this Bill and I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive speech which certainly cleared up some questions in my mind. This Bill was referred to the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny on 21 November last and then referred to the Joint Committee on European Affairs for further detailed scrutiny. The members of that committee had little difficulty with it and felt it took a sensible approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">We welcome a harmonised approach to insurance for airline carriers. The world is now a small place.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Huge volumes of traffic pass through airports every day and it is vital that airline passengers have maximum rights. I was amazed to learn that in any given 24-hour period, in the region of 1,000 aircraft use Irish airspace. This works out at nearly 7,000 aircraft per week at peak times, although the distinction between peak and off-peak has blurred in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The previous obligation on aircraft operators from non-EU countries simply to have insurance has proved unsatisfactory. The fact that an amount of insurance is specified is a welcome step. As Aer Lingus and Ryanair already meet the proposed insurance requirements there should not be any fare increases for passengers using their services.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Widespread public consultation was undertaken in regard to this proposal. Advertisements were placed in newspapers last March. The lack of response is an indication that the public is quite happy with the proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The Bill deals with the insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators. It aims to ensure a harmonised approach to the level of insurance held by aircraft carriers in response to the increased fears of terrorist attacks arising from the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States. We continue to be at risk from such attacks. In the terrorist attack in Bali but for the grace of God some Irish people would have been killed. Even a terrorist attack thousands of miles away in Bali can have a direct impact on Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The Bill will allow us to ratify the Montreal Convention, thus giving it the force of law here. The Montreal Convention updated and replaced the Warsaw Convention and the Minister of State clearly outlined the benefits attached to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">On a point of clarification, will the Minister inform the House of the implications of the Rome Convention, which I came across in researching this area? I am not sure what it is, although I am aware we have not yet signed it. What is it, do we plan to sign it and, if not, why not? Will it have an implication for the Bill before us?</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Currently European Union countries have high levels of insurance cover, in excess of €1 billion, but many carriers from non-EU countries have considerably less than this. Given this state of affairs the European Commission correctly brought forward a proposal to ensure a harmonised approach to insurance that will enhance the rights of passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The regulation will apply to all EU and non-EU carriers and operators that fly into EU airports or use EU airspace. All such carriers will be required to have specific minimum levels of insurance for passengers, baggage, mail, cargo and third parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Current regulations require aircraft operators simply to have insurance, without specifying actual amounts. The existing recommended amounts are relatively low compared to that held by most carriers in EU member states. The level of insurance will depend on the maximum take-off weight of the aircraft and the insurance must include cover for acts of war or terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The Minister of State's point on ratification before 1 May is valid. Accordingly, I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the Houses. By passing the legislation before 1 May, it will also apply to the ten accession countries, which is good news for all concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Non-EU aviation carriers operating in Ireland are currently regulated by the Department of Transport, but the implementation of the regulation is not expected to have significant implications for it. The Irish Aviation Authority will be responsible for enforcement in the area of individual aircraft licences. Does the Minister of State foresee any extra workload for the Department or the authority in this area?</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The legislation will ensure that sufficient funds will be available to meet compensation costs in the case of an accident in Ireland between EU and non-EU carriers from any of the states which are party to the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The provision on the French language is unusual. The Minister of State expanded on this point in his speech. Surely it would make more sense to have English as the main language of Europe. While it may not be the first language of most European countries, it is one which is widely spoken and may help prevent further confusion. Is this provision set in stone or can it be changed?</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Where do we stand in regard to making amendments to the Bill? If we make amendments, will they have an impact on other countries? Does the legislation go back to the European Parliament, for example, for further ratification?</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I welcome the Bill, which is a good one. It is hard to say anything bad about it. Members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs queried the matter of state aircraft not coming under the remit of the legislation. This is due to the Chicago Convention which dictated that, in the event of a crash involving state aircraft, the Government in question would honour any liabilities. This may be the subject of discussion in Brussels today. It is certainly on the agenda for discussion at European Union level. Will the Minister of State clarify the issue of liability in the case of the involvement of military or State aircraft in an accident? As far as I know, it is outside the remit of the legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_241">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. He is filling in for the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, who are chairing a Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels. It is an important meeting which deals with the open skies issue, which is currently under discussion between the European Union and the United States. We send them our best wishes in that regard. As Senators are aware, the open skies issue, which is of benefit to the country, has given rise to concern, especially in the west of Ireland. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, shares those concerns in regard to Shannon Airport and the western region. We await the outcome of the discussions with bated breath.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">As previous speakers' outlined, the principal purpose of the Bill is to ratify the Montreal Convention and give it the full force of Irish law. It updates the Warsaw Convention and the various amendments that have taken place since the Warsaw Convention was agreed in 1929.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Senator Browne rightly referred to the vast changes that have taken place in the area of aviation since that time, especially in recent years with the advent of low fares and other developments. The Warsaw Convention is not a matter we have dealt with in great detail or one that we need be concerned with on a daily basis. However, when we are bored on a flight we may decide to read some of the fine print on the back of our airline tickets where one usually finds details relating to the liability of the carrier. Flying at 37,000 or 38,000 feet one may discover the scant liability of an airline in the event of an accident or, as frequently happens, when one's bag does not appear and is never found or if it is damaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">As the Minister of State said, the Montreal Convention updates many of the terms and conditions of the Warsaw Convention. The liability of airlines is important, especially in regard to our own person and the concerns we have about accidents which might take place while we are on board an aircraft.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Nobody is overly concerned about who is liable in the event of a major accident because those involved are generally not alive to worry about it. However, there is a concern that those who have non-fatal accidents outside the jurisdiction might not have sufficient finances to take care of their medical expenses. Permanent loss of one's baggage or damage to goods must also be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I welcome the provisions on cargo in the Bill. Much worldwide trade is now about just-in-time delivery of goods. Trade used to be of a much less advanced nature and shipping took place over a prolonged period. Many goods nowadays, particularly hardware and software for the IT industry, require just-in-time delivery. As the Minister of State outlined, updating the conventions will allow for much speedier delivery of goods between the exporter, the baggage handlers and those at the delivery point. This is a welcome development and will ensure that trade will be facilitated by electronic means.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">If one believes increased liability on air carriers means there is no longer a necessity to have travel insurance, one should note that travel insurance is a very important part of air travel. It is not just to cover any medical problems a passenger might have, either as a result of an accident or falling ill while out of one's jurisdiction, but also to cover the loss of personal baggage or damage thereto. My experience of travel over many years has shown there is a very good range of insurance products on the market, of which passengers should make themselves aware. It is only as a last resort that one should be depending on the conditions as set down in this legislation and the conventions. It is vital that people still continue to take out travel insurance to protect against the aforementioned eventualities.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">It has been made clear that all airlines we refer to as First World airlines already have sufficient insurance to cover their liabilities. I understand that they retain insurance against a liability of about €1 billion. However, the purpose of this Bill and the conventions is to bring into line Third World airlines that do not cover themselves to this extent. Principally, it is about the extension of the higher liability limits to airlines worldwide, thus providing very significant benefits for passengers travelling with certain non-EU airlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Although many Third World airlines are not flying to Ireland or Europe, this will obviously change as business develops between Europe and the countries in which those airlines are based in the coming years. It is important to bear this in mind because air travel is increasing outside the EU and between the EU and Third World countries. Many Third World countries are emerging from the depths of a depression and poor economic circumstances and are growing by way of many of the many economic development programmes initiated by First World countries, thus resulting in an increase in air travel. The conventions ensure that the Third World airlines will put in place the necessary finance to ensure their liability is covered in all circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">We are all familiar with the international growth in tourism and business links. India, for example, has experienced high growth in its IT industry. The net effect of the business generated by India's measures to ensure its education system produces graduates highly skilled in the development of computer software is an increase in the frequency of air travel and, ultimately, of cargo transfer between India, Europe and the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">This effect is also evident in respect of the increased manufacturing trade between Europe, America and China. The manufacturing industry in China is partly operating to the detriment of manufacturing throughout Europe but it will bring about an increase in air travel. Therefore, it is important that this legislation is in place. It serves as further recognition of what is referred to as the global village and the fact that certain parts of the world, although they might have been considered well outside the remit of the First World, have generated business through the development of trade links and through their manufacturing base, albeit using cheaper labour.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">Air travel has certainly changed significantly in recent years. We spoke of this last week when the Aer Lingus Bill was passing through the House and we recognised that low fares and no-frills services are very much a part of passenger travel. It is important that these phenomena are not operating at the expense of safety. By putting in place the proposed legislative measures, we will ensure there will be a level playing pitch in terms of the insurance liability of airlines, in which case it will not be possible for some airlines to have a much poorer safety record than others. We would all welcome this.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Baggage handling is an important part of air travel and it is important to ensure that airlines are largely responsible for the protection of one's goods while travelling. Thus, there would be fair competition between all airlines, even in a low-fares, no-frills environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The Warsaw system was good and while it needed updating it certainly provided for air travel to date. This Bill will take account of the recent amendments that have been made. There are two European regulations covering this area, one of which came into force in 1997 and the other in 2002. As Senator Browne stated, all the airlines operating in the European Union were already subject to the rules in this regard. However, they will now be enshrined in European law.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">As the Minister of State has outlined, under section 11 the relevant provisions of the current law, namely the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936, as amended, are repealed, allowing one Bill to cover the entire subject. This should be welcomed in the House. Legal practitioners, politicians and many of those who must consider Bills before amendments are made will welcome this. As Bills are amended over a number of years, following the changes can be quite tedious and therefore it is good that the Department of Transport has sought to consolidate all the legislation in this area. I hope the legal people in the courts, who often like to tell us what to do, will compliment the Department on its efforts in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I also welcome the provision that makes it easier for passengers to bring a legal action in their principal country of residence, referred to as the fifth jurisdiction. There were four places in which one could take a case, namely, the place of business of the airline, the place of an accident if it related to an accident, the point of origin of the passenger or the goods and the intended destination if the goods arrived. It is important to allow passengers or companies to whose goods it relates to take the case in their own countries. When we deal with Third World countries whose legal systems are very different from ours and from those of the First World in general, it is important that a level of good governance is put in place to ensure the credibility of the efforts made.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">It is important on procedural grounds that if all members of the EU have ratified the convention by 1 May it will automatically extend to the ten accession countries. We know how necessary it is to pass legislation to ensure that we comply with many EU conditions and if we can assist our friends in the accession countries we should attempt to do so. We on this side of the House intend to get this Bill through as quickly as possible. I thank Senator Browne for his efforts in that regard. I see Senator McDowell here although I have not yet heard him speak but I hope he will not delay the Bill in any way.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_259">In some quarters the discussion seems to be academic in that many First World airlines already adhere to those standards and as we do not have much trade between the two countries it is not particularly relevant. This is changing, however, because much of the work of the Department of Transport in restructuring Aer Rianta to have three independent boards manage the airports will place an onus on each board to find new business and new airlines prepared to build links with other markets. We will see some airlines hitherto unknown to us travelling in and out of Ireland. Trade will be generated too by the multicultural society now emerging here. Many of those who have come here seeking asylum will eventually become part of our society and as their countries move beyond their own difficulties we will trade with them. This is an important Bill to ensure that emerging airlines wishing to travel to and from Ireland will be in a position to provide the same level of cover as others.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_262">Indeed no. It is one of those frustrating Bills which sets out a convention the negotiation of which did not involve anyone in either House and which we cannot change. Nevertheless, it is a product of international negotiation over some years and improves conditions for passengers and cargo which is positive. This is necessary because the nature of international air travel has changed quite dramatically in recent years. It seems passengers feel the standard of service which they had come to expect is no longer available as of right and necessity. The emphasis in the past five or six years has been on low cost travel and no frills or low frills. Passengers now feel the most they can reasonably expect is to turn up, hope the flight is there and that they and their baggage arrive more or less on time at their destinations. Our expectations have diminished since ten or 15 years ago when air travel was regarded almost as a luxury to be enjoyed for its own sake. Now we take a more utilitarian view, namely to reach our destinations as quickly and cheaply as possible. In those circumstances it is important that there are standards and that there is an international body and convention or conventions that at least regulate basic standards of carriage. The Warsaw Convention sought to do that and the Montreal Convention now seeks to update it.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Others have set out the legal background to this Bill and I do not intend to repeat that. There are, however, some issues worth highlighting or exploring a little further. I read cursorily the two conventions as set out in the Schedules and the new Montreal Convention. There seems to be a significant improvement in the manner of dealing with liability which is crucial to the possibility of any passenger trying to enforce rights. One starts in a position of peculiar inequality between the parties concerned. If baggage is lost or an accident occurs, in most cases passengers have no idea how it happened. They may have checked luggage through in Dublin to Warsaw via Paris or London and do not know whether their baggage got lost or damaged, or whether something was taken out of it, in Dublin, London or Warsaw. They are not in a position to prove that the airline or the airport authorities in a particular place were responsible so they do not know against whom they should bring an action. The shift between the conventions from having to establish some level of liability to strict liability is crucial and provides a reasonable level of certainty to the passenger that even if he or she does not know what happened he or she can still hope to get some compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Minister of State gave the impression that liability was absolutely strict but it seems from reading the conventions that is not quite as strict as we would like. There are still ways in which the carrier can evade some responsibility, for example, for delay. According to Article 8.19 of the Montreal Convention the carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay unless it proves that it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage or that it was impossible to take such measures. There are still ways in which the carriers can use information known only to them to avoid liability. We have moved, however, from a position in which the passenger had to prove the negligence of the airline to one in which the airline must prove it was not negligent, which is a great improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The Montreal Convention removes the upper limit for accident victims but in section 7 of the Bill we set a limit of €20,000 on the damages that can be provided for mental distress. Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify whether this is a specifically Irish provision. I am not sure whether that flows from the convention or whether it is a self-imposed limit. I recall from my practice of law that there is a similar limit in Irish law for compensation for mental distress arising out of someone's death being provided to dependants. Perhaps it is a Department decision to impose a similar limit for Irish purposes and to transpose it into the convention. I would be interested to know if that is the case and the rationale behind it.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The provision for state non-commercial flights is interesting. There is little persuasive reason that we should not extend the provisions of the convention, for example, with regard to the death of passengers or of people on the ground, to damage that might be caused by state or military aircraft. We have been fortunate here in having escaped this but there have been accidents in other countries involving military aircraft that have caused damage and killed people on the ground. For example, in Italy a few years ago some American military aircraft were involved in an accident with a ski lift. The convention does not appear to cover such incidents. We should perhaps consider that such an accident might occur here and it would be useful if the Minister made the declaration which is open to him to make under the terms of the Bill that state aircraft would also be included under the terms of the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">There is a provision in the Montreal Convention dealing with tickets but I am not sure what it means. A cursory layperson's reading of the earlier conventions makes it clear, strangely, that tickets were required to be in writing. They had to be on paper giving the details of the passenger's name, destination, time of flight etc. Recently we have seen an accelerated move towards electronic booking. The majority of people book airline seats on-line and frequently do not get tickets. Some airlines are trying to encourage a ticket-less flight. From my reading of Article 3 of the updated convention I am not clear whether this matter is covered. It seems the ticket comprises the contract between the airline and the passenger. While this does not nullify the existence of a contract, the absence of a ticket obviously provides difficulty in establishing whether one exists. Is it the Minister's understanding that the notion of ticket-less flight is to be included in the context of the new convention?</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I wish to comment on enforceability. The convention has detailed provisions requiring compensation to be provided within a particular period of time and requiring passengers to complain within a particular period of time. A passenger whose baggage is lost is required to complain within 21 days. Following a delay of a few days or a week, the airline should be obliged to notify passengers of their rights under the convention or other EU law and that they are entitled to compensation. I do not know what is the current practice or whether there are many instances of passengers who would be entitled to compensation failing to claim it within the requisite period. People take it for granted that there is a risk of their baggage not showing up and it is tough luck if this happens. Most people are unlikely to follow through provided their baggage arrives at some time. It is important that the airline be up-front in advising passengers that they may be entitled to compensation in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I listened with interest to what Senators Browne and Dooley said about insurance. I confess to only having read the Schedules today and I did not see those provisions. They may be provided for elsewhere and perhaps the Minister could clarify this matter. I presume there is a liability on carriers to ensure they have a level of insurance that enables them to abide by the provisions of this convention and other EU law. I know updated regulations exist that oblige airlines to pay passengers in the event of a delay in flights and to provide accommodation if there is a delay overnight. While I do not believe it is contained in this convention, are airlines required to show they can abide by the provisions and look after passengers inconvenienced by their negligence?</p>
          <p eId="para_270">This is not a Bill that can be amended in that it is dictated by an international convention. It is a significant move forward and we hope it will be adopted by the requisite number of countries within a reasonable period.</p>

        <speech by="#DiarmuidWilson" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Mr. Wilson</from>
          <p eId="para_271">I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and his officials to the House. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Air Navigation and Transport (International Conventions) Bill 2004. The Bill will allow Ireland to ratify the Montreal Convention, and will give the convention the force of law in Ireland. The Montreal Convention is an updated replacement for the Warsaw Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air (1929), which, together with subsequent amendments, is referred to as the Warsaw system. The Warsaw system provides a worldwide system of standards and rules for carriage by air.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Section 4 provides for the three conventions, the Warsaw Convention with the amendments made by the Hague Protocol in 1955, the same convention with the additional amendments made by Protocol No. 4 of the 1975 Montreal Convention and the 1999 Montreal Convention we are discussing today, to have the force of law in Ireland. I note that the first two conventions are already enshrined in Irish law under the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1936, as amended. The relevant provisions of that Act are repealed in section 11 of the Bill. I welcome that all of the legislation in this area will be conveniently available in one Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I mentioned 1936, the year Aer Lingus, our national airline, was formed. On the day the airline announced profits of €78.5 million against the background of the war in Iraq and the SARS scare, I take the opportunity to congratulate the board, the chief executive, his management team and the workers on their success which is a far cry from the depressing state of the airline three years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">From the Minister's speech I note that ratification of the Montreal Convention by all EU member states and by the European Community before 1 May 2004 will ensure the Montreal Convention will automatically extend to the ten accession countries, when they become members on 1 May 2004. Otherwise the process will be delayed until all ten accession countries are in a position to ratify the agreement individually, which would be regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I welcome that the Montreal Convention was signed by 52 countries on its publication in 1999, including many EU member states. Ireland signed in 2000. In November 2003, the United States became the 13th country to ratify the convention thereby causing it to enter into force among the states that have ratified it.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Article 21 provides for compensation in the case of death or injury of passengers. I welcome that the carrier will be strictly liable for the first €118,000 of proven damages for each passenger. I was amazed that the amount under the Warsaw system was only about €20,000. Chapter 5 of the convention deals with carriage by air, performed by a person other than the contracting carrier. This is primarily to cover, what is known as "code-sharing" among airlines. A person may be quoted a price on the Internet for a flight from Dublin to New York and then find a cheaper price through a competing airline. I welcome the developments in this regard in chapter 5.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">As an island, aviation is very important to us and I welcome the Bill, which reflects many improvements on the old Warsaw system. I join my colleague Senator Dooley in thanking Members from the Labour Party and Fine Gael for their agreement with this Bill thus far this evening.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_135">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_278">Last week we discussed the Aer Lingus Bill 2003. The mid-west region has a very close affinity with air navigation. First, there were the flying boats that flew out of Foynes, from where I come. There is a very good aviation museum in Foynes which commemorates that important era in our navigational past. Subsequently, we became very familiar with the successes at Shannon and at the air navigation control centre in Ballygireen just outside Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I recognise that the whole objective of this Bill is to achieve harmonisation in respect of different airlines in the context of insurance and so on. That is desirable. This legislation has many inherently good values in terms of people being able to take the legal part of their case within their own country. I understand that much of this is the result of the events of 11 September 2001 and concern about terrorism. When the Montreal Convention came into operation, 50 OECD countries automatically signed up to it. The events of 11 September changed the operation of the whole airline area, especially regarding security, and various restrictions have been introduced, particularly in the United States. Perhaps the Minister would comment on why it took until November 2002 for the US to sign up to the Montreal Convention when other countries enthusiastically embraced it.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Senator McDowell referred to the important point of how one copes in a ticketless situation. What verification is there, and how can one prove one's case, if there are no tickets? In page 15 of the Bill, Article 22(5) of the charter, as amended, states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_281">The sums mentioned in francs in this Article shall be deemed to refer to a currency unit consisting of sixty-five and a half milligrammes of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. These sums may be converted into national currencies in round figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Perhaps the Minister would clarify what that means. What are the guidelines for converting something so vague into round figures if the currency referred to is gold in all cases? What is meant by the word "millesimal"? I am usually good on vocabulary, but I have never heard of that word. The Minister's officials will probably be able to clarify it.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I will not belabour points already made. From our point of view the Bill contains nothing contentious. It is important to have it enacted by 1 May deadline. If it is not ratified and in operation in all the European countries there will be inherent difficulties when the ten accession countries join as the issue of having it ratified could linger for a long time. The Minister will have the co-operation of both Houses in ensuring its ratification during the Irish Presidency. Far be it from me to try to embarrass the Government, but it will be extremely embarrassing if we have not ratified it by 1 May when the other EU countries are moving on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I join Senator Wilson in congratulating Aer Lingus on its revenue success and on how it has been turned around as a company. It has had to confront many serious worldwide incidents since the 11 September attacks, including the SARS and foot and mouth disease outbreaks. Aer Lingus has been a very successful carrier in recent times. It has learned much from Ryanair's "no frills" approach, which has been adopted on many of its continental routes in recent times. Passengers no longer get the privilege of a cup of tea. However, the consumer is the person who dictates, and if the consumer is happy with the price and is prepared to put up with not having extra concessions, Aer Lingus was probably right in taking the direction it has.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">That does not allay the concerns of the mid-west region regarding what is happening in Shannon. I elaborated on it in last week's debate on the Aer Lingus Bill and will not repeat what I said then. However, if more than 100 redundancies are being sought and 28 cabin crew are required to transfer to Dublin, that is very hard to reconcile with the fact that the airline has been successfully turning over significant revenue in the past three years and €78 million in the current year. One might play the devil's advocate and say that if we want to return greater revenues next year rationalisation is necessary. However, it is important to bear in mind that decentralisation, an issue that raised the rafters at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis over the weekend, will probably be a lifeline for many communities around the country because the type of employment it will bring is regarded as long-term and stable. Nevertheless, it might be seen as contradictory to speak of decentralising Government Departments and agencies to 25 different counties if, so far, only four people in Enterprise Ireland have volunteered to transfer to Shannon. Decentralisation, if it happens, will probably create an extra 200 jobs, but alongside that will be a reduction of 100 jobs in Aer Lingus and Shannon and the dislocation of many families, in addition to which Aer Rianta will have to make adjustments in terms of many of its staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The high degree of uncertainty in the mid-west region is compounded by the lengthy failure to appoint a board of directors at Aer Rianta. A board of directors has recently been appointed for Dublin, but there is uncertainty in the mid-west region about what the directors of Aer Rianta will be doing and what kind of business plan they will operate regarding the future of Shannon. It is time this uncertainty was resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Despite the revenues and strong performance of Aer Lingus, I am extremely concerned about what is evolving in Shannon and the type of rationalisation taking place. If we are to be true to the whole decentralisation concept, Shannon was a classic example of decentralisation operating very effectively because it involved an airport entity which has been in existence since the late 1940s. It was a crucial issue a few years ago when two Government Deputies resigned because of changes in the Shannon area. Subsequently both returned to the fold and one was successful and became a Minister. It is time we saw a clamour from the many Fianna Fáil members in Clare about what is happening in the Clare area. It is far more serious than the issue over which people took a classic stance a few years ago when a policy decision was taken by the Government which would impact on Shannon in the long term. What is happening now is very worrying. I would like to see much more leadership on the other side in highlighting it and perhaps taking firm stances on it in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">It has had a financial impact in the airport because there is no continuity of military aircraft landing. It is impacting on the revenue of Aer Rianta. To say that is a significant earner which sustains Shannon is disingenuous for the simple reason that it gave only a temporary lift to the economy and Aer Rianta. It is unsustainable in the long term. What will sustain Aer Rianta and Shannon in the long term is much more promotion of the airport and increased aircraft traffic. One can hardly fly from Dublin to Shannon or from Shannon to Dublin. There are business interests, including companies like Dell, moving into Shannon. They cannot attract business from abroad, their clients cannot even fly into Shannon, and they are trying to get connecting flights from Shannon to Dublin. We should bring back Garrett FitzGerald and ask him to study the timetables. He might decide that they should be revised and positive action might then be taken in respect of Shannon.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">We will continue to enhance those facilities going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Senator Dooley, in a wide-ranging contribution referred to the importance of international aviation in terms of the multicultural society in which we live. We are confident that the changes we are making will take account of the opportunities for our country. The convention with which the Bill deals takes account of the major changes taking place on a global basis. Aviation is becoming ever more relevant and practical and is being used by increasing numbers of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Senator Browne inquired about the Rome aviation convention. That convention deals with compensation for people on the ground and it has not been ratified by a sufficient number of countries to make it part of international law. It is, therefore, inert at present. The International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, is currently considering revisions to the Rome Convention. We hope that these will be supported internationally and will help to create a more modern, relevant convention which will be acceptable to the vast majority of countries and which will be ratified in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The Montreal Convention does not involve activity by the Department of Transport; it only comes into effect when a court case arises. In other words, the Department will respond from a national point of view in the event of Irish nationals being involved in court cases and similar situations. The old Warsaw Convention was drafted in French. As the baseline documents are all in the French language, the convention cannot be changed. State aircraft are included in the Montreal Convention unless we, as a sovereign Government, specifically exclude them. I thank Senator Wilson for his contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Senator McDowell referred to section 7 and inquired whether it is an Irish provision. The people who drafted the Montreal Convention decided not to include mental distress therein. The limit on damages for mental distress is also included in the Civil Liability Act 1961, as amended by subsequent legislation. It is, therefore, an Irish provision which was introduced in 1961 and which has been updated in the interim.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The Senator also referred to Article 50 of the Montreal Convention which requires aviation insurance to be provided by carriers. Airlines are also required to have insurance under European law and a new European Union regulation is currently nearing completion. This will apply insurance requirements to non-EU airlines, a matter to which Senator Dooley alluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Senator Finucane referred to Article 22. This relates only to countries which do not use special drawing rights. The special drawing rights contained in the original convention are used by most countries. In the event that they are not included in the domestic legislation passed by such countries, the bottom line comes down to the interpretation and the comparison in respect of the gold standard situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">This is the title given to the various allowances and compensation in international law under the Montreal Convention. Senator Finucane also referred to ticketing. Article 3.2 of the Montreal Convention allows for other means of tickets but also requires the carrier to also offer to provide a written statement to passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">The Montreal Convention on aviation is extremely important. It will deliver significant benefits for international air passengers and users of the air freight industry. Ratification by Ireland and other European Union member states will ensure that those benefits are available on routes to and from Europe. This is important to our economy in terms of its future growth. We are confident that such economic growth will be sustainable and that international aviation will play a major role in that growth. This is also an important matter for the European Union and its economic growth, particularly in light of the accession of new member states on 1 May. We thank the Seanad for its committed co-operation to ensure that the Bill will be passed as quickly as possible in order that new member states will enjoy the full protection of this important convention.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">The Minister should be well aware of the difficulties in many areas of the country where we just do not have sufficient community welfare officers. Those officers are under great stress working in difficult situations. I want to speak particularly about the community welfare officers in the Dublin 15 area — Blanchardstown, Castleknock, Clonsilla and Mulhuddart — where there are six officers. These officers are greatly under-resourced as the population of the Dublin 15 area has grown considerably in the past number of years and continues to do so. Yet the number of community welfare officers has not increased. This situation is so bad that St. Vincent de Paul has raised the matter with me and with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The lack of officers in the area has resulted in the suspension of drop-in hours. Somebody who has a difficulty can no longer drop in to speak with his or her community welfare officer. People now have to leave a message on the answering machine or write to their officer. However, problems arise suddenly for people and cannot be immediately resolved by writing a letter. People want to see their community welfare officer as soon as possible and that has always been the system. Therefore, the suspension of the drop-in hours has caused great concern to many people out there. We need a big increase in the number of community welfare officers in the Dublin 15 area. We also need better working conditions for those officers. They are working out of the Roselawn health centre and another centre in Mountview. These health centres are already overcrowded, with many people coming in to visit the dentist, the doctor and so on. Therefore the provision of new accommodation and an increase in the number of community welfare officers is needed to catch up with the population growth in the area.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_316">As Senator Terry is aware, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the community welfare staff of the various health boards on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. We are aware that difficulties have arisen in the service being provided to the public in the Dublin 15 area. The Northern Area Health Board is responsible for the daily administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the area concerned. The board has advised that unfortunately it is no longer offering a walk-in or face-to-face service to the public in Dublin 15 due to accommodation difficulties in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The locations affected include Blanchardstown, Mulhuddart, Clonee and Hartstown. People requiring access to a community welfare officer in those areas are currently asked to telephone a freephone number to make an appointment or, alternatively, to complete a claim form and either post it or deliver it to the appropriate health centre. The community welfare officers are working overtime to deal with the volume of claims. I take this opportunity to thank the health board staff involved for their commitment in dealing with this difficult situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The board has advised that it felt it had no choice but to withdraw the facility of a walk-in service to the public in Dublin 15 due to the numbers of people queuing to see the community welfare officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The root cause of the difficulties being experienced is the large increase in the population of the area which in turn has led to an increase in the number of people seeking assistance from the community welfare officers. The health board has not as yet been able to obtain additional office accommodation because there is a shortage of such in the area. However, it is in the process of securing additional office space and is making every effort to expedite this.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">In the meantime, I understand that the board will assign two more community welfare officers to the area by the end of this month. This will bring the number of community welfare officers serving the area from six to eight and will alleviate matters somewhat.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I can assure the Senator and the House that every effort is being made to ensure that the disruption of the service to the public is kept to a minimum and that the delay in processing applications is also kept to a minimum. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has been involved in discussions with the board to identify a solution which would assist in dealing with the current difficulties. The Department will continue to monitor developments with a view to ensuring that a full service is restored as quickly as possible.</p>
