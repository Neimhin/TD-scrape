        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">On this morning it is appropriate we bear in mind the absolutely stunning victory of Senator Barack Obama in his bid to become the 44th President of the United States.  I am sure the House would want to send good wishes to him on the monumental task he is undertaking and the responsibility he is being given by the American people.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">I contrast the wave of euphoria which has washed across the United States and many parts of the world with the pessimism and cynicism that exists here.  An event in this country yesterday epitomised that point exactly.  Two reports were published, referred to by both Deputies Reilly and O'Dowd, which dealt with cancer services in the north east and the abolition of a programme for cervical cancer vaccination for girls between ten and 12 years old.  It reminds me of the incident in Britain a number of years ago when a famous remark was made that "it was a good day to bury bad news".</p>
          <p eId="para_3">The cervical cancer vaccination programme was to cost less than €10 million and was announced in August by the Minister for Health and Children.  She stated it was clearly now a priority to move on to vaccination for young girls, with the clear intent of preventing death because 80 people may die from cervical cancer every year.  As Deputy Reilly pointed out, the amount of money involved is tiny and in the context of the long-term saving of lives, the Government's action is short-sighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">When was the report for the north east received?  What was the role of the Minister for Health and Children and her officials in announcing this abolition of the cervical vaccination programme yesterday?  Why is there an intention to have pay increases of approximately €263 million next year when front line services like this, which are so important for young girls, are being cut?  Why was yesterday chosen as the day to make the announcement when the HSE and the Minister for Health and Children knew — or perhaps expected — that people might not notice it?</p>
          <p eId="para_5">In the context of the very small amount of money involved and lives which could be saved, as pointed out by Deputy Reilly, does the Taoiseach agree that allowing for pay increases and bonuses for managers of quite an extensive nature epitomises the fact that, in desperation, the Government will chop a service providing health and safety measures for all those young girls, some of whom will contract cervical cancer in future years?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_6">I join with Deputy Kenny in wishing Senator Obama well in the transition which must take place before he takes office in the new year as President of the United States.  We look forward to maintaining a good relationship with the incoming Administration, as we have had with the outgoing one.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I do not agree with Deputy Kenny on his perception of cynicism and pessimism.  If that is a trait he wishes to pursue, it is a matter for him.  It is a matter for us to continue to deal with a position that is as challenging for us as it is for other countries and to do so based on our belief and capacity to come through this period and return to growth as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">With regard to the specific issues mentioned by the Deputy, the Minister informed the Government yesterday about the north east radiology report.  The nine patients who had a delayed diagnosis were identified and diagnosed prior to March 2008 and no further cases of delayed diagnoses were identified during this look-back review.  The HSE has recognised the need to respond in a timely fashion when serious concerns relating to misdiagnosis arise.  Protocols and guidance were not in place around the thresholds and methodology for reviews of this nature when concerns were first raised about delayed diagnosis.  The HSE also faced logistical difficulties, including the sourcing of sufficient radiologists to carry out a review of almost 6,000 X-rays and CT scans.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">As a result of the issues and delays which arose in commencing this review, a process of engagement with the faculty of radiology of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland was initiated in June this year.  Protocols to provide guidance around dealing with reports of error in radiology are currently being developed between the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the HSE.  The process will be completed before the end of this year and will provide clarity and confidence in decision-making around reviews of this nature in future.  The HSE has also formally engaged with the forum of postgraduate training bodies to set up a rapid response mechanism for incidents of this kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">With regard to the vaccine issue, the continuation and expansion of the cancer control programme under Professor Tom Keane remains a priority and funding of €15 million has been made available for this purpose.  At present, the national cervical screening programme, CervicalCheck, is being rolled out with a full-year cost of €35 million.  The programme will provide free smear tests through primary care settings to the 1.1 million women living in Ireland aged between 25 and 60 years.  A successful national programme has the potential to cut mortality rates from cervical cancer by up to 80%, and we will proceed along that line.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_11">That is the HSE response as quoted in all the newspapers recently.  The vaccination programme was intended for ten and 12 year old girls.  Moreover, the HIQA report that was given to the Minister for Health and Children also stated there should be a catch-up phase for 13 to 15 year olds.  Both measures have been scrapped although in August, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated "it is clear the main priority now is to move to the introduction of the vaccination programme for 12 year old girls to commence in September 2009".</p>
          <p eId="para_12">I refer to the Taoiseach's statement yesterday to the effect he must make adjustments, between tax increases and cuts, in the order of €5,000 million, to bring the economy back into shape by 2010.  In this case, he is aware the figures produced show there would be a saving of €2.7 million, because of disease avoided, on an annual basis over time.  Nevertheless, this vital vaccination programme now is gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">More than seven years have passed since the issues of the north east first were brought to the Government's attention.  I will provide the Taoiseach with an example that demonstrates both how dysfunctional is the HSE, which is the creation of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the reason the Government is unable to make savings in this area.  I have to hand a letter from an employee of the HSE who, in an act of patriotism as called for by the Minister for Finance, instructed his bosses to reduce his salary by 5%.  The HSE's response to him was that his request was unusual.  It went on to state, "I would be grateful if you would assist my understanding of your request before I consider appropriate actions".  This was the response of the HSE to an employee who asked it to reduce his salary, as an act of patriotism, by 5% for 2009.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_15">However, the same HSE will award itself bonuses for managers.  Although a €263 million pay increase has been awarded across the service, a lousy €10 million for vaccination for young girls between the age of ten and 12 has been shafted by the Minister for Health and Children.  Moreover, the announcement was made on the day of the American presidential election when, in an act of despicable cynicism, it was expected that people would take no notice of it.  The Taoiseach should respond to this issue and should give me his response regarding what the HSE wrote to its employee.  Can the Taoiseach imagine anything as nonsensical as the HSE replying to its own employee in such a manner?  Does the Taoiseach have a view in this regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_24">The point is that health is one of the areas in which the Government has increased expenditure.  The same public service pay pause, which, as matters stand has been negotiated with the social partners until 1 October next year, applies to the health service as to other services.  It is important to point out that even with these savings and the efforts to economise that are necessary to restore order to the public finances, next year we still will borrow on a day to day basis €4.7 billion more than we will earn.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Moreover, as for the suggestion I have read to the effect that we are cutting €5 billion in expenditure next year, it is important to note we have indicated in our three year programme our intention to move back to budgetary balance as soon as possible and to work through that process.  Consequently, that particular figure is wrong.  The only issue I have with the Fine Gael Party in respect of bringing the public finances into order is that although it believes there should be another €2 billion in cuts, it has not agreed to any cuts thus far or on the €2 billion it wishes to implement.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">In just over ten minutes time, the Central Statistics Office will publish the latest unemployment figures.  Last month, these figures showed that more than 240,000 people were on the live register, which constituted an increase of 80,000 over the figure for the same month the previous year.  The latest available figures from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment state there were more than 32,000 redundancies notified to that Department in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Rising unemployment is the single biggest economic problem that Ireland now faces.  It is contributing hugely to the problem in the public finances.  Every additional person who becomes unemployed is one less worker paying tax to the State and one more household drawing social welfare and related benefits.  Moreover, that is before one counts the social and personal cost of unemployment.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions.  First, will he tell Members the total number on the live register, which will be published and announced by the Central Statistics Office in ten minutes time?  Second, when I asked the Taoiseach last September what initiatives the Government had taken to deal with the unemployment problem, he could not point to a single initiative the Government had taken over the entire summer period.  I again ask him today whether he can inform Members of specific initiatives the Government has taken or is taking to halt the slide in unemployment and to put people back to work.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_29">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_41">As for the question on the live register, I understand from memory of yesterday's meeting that the figure is approximately 252,000, or 6.7% of the total workforce.  As the Deputy is aware, that figure includes those who are temporarily moving in and out of work and the labour force survey is the most accurate measure of unemployment.  However, in respect of the policies that have been enacted by the Government to try to deal with this situation, we already have indicated that as we are in recessionary times, unfortunately we have been obliged to budget for increased unemployment next year.  Unfortunately it is true there is an additional cost of approximately €1.25 billion to make provision in the social welfare budget next year for that contingency.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">Second, thankfully the Government has been pursuing polices, many of which were opposed by the Deputy in opposition, which have created much employment.  Third, as for what the Government now is trying to do, it is ensuring that FÁS and other agencies are providing initiatives and courses to people to help with upskilling.  The Government is working on the skills survey outcome, which has come from the people it employs for that purpose.  There also is the question of continuing with the correct strategy.  First, it is trying to bring order to the public finances, although the Labour Party has opposed all the cuts announced.  Second, the Government continues to apply major resources in respect of the strategy on science, technology and innovation although none was applied when the Labour Party was in government.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">The figure of 252,000 unemployed is shocking.  That is almost 100,000 more people out of work than this time last year.  It is a shocking level of job losses.  Two thousand jobs per week have been lost in the course of the past year.  The Taoiseach's business as usual response, that FÁS courses will be provided and that he is continuing with the economic policies of the Government is the most frightening thing of all.  Continuing the economic policies of the Government that has landed us with 100,000 extra people unemployed during the past year is the problem.  The only thing the budget did for people who are unemployed was to make it harder for them to get jobseeker's benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">The Government has abandoned people who are losing their jobs and has turned its back on the unemployed.  People who are losing their jobs in the Irish economy today do not want the dole.  They want work.  They do not want to be on a FÁS course, they want to be in a job.  My question to the Taoiseach was not about FÁS courses, nor was it about the kind of generalised statement and response he has given, I asked him specifically what initiatives he is taking to get people back to work.  The concerns people who are losing their jobs have are about when they will be back at work.  They want work.  People who are in employment want some sense that they are not going to lose their jobs.  They are not getting that reassurance from the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">On the question of how we ensure we deal with the problem of rising unemployment, we have to maintain competitiveness in the economy.  Every economy currently in recession is losing jobs.  The European economy is losing jobs.  The US economy is losing jobs.  Jobs are being lost in Asia and everywhere else.  That is not to be defeatist about it but it is a fact.  If we do not understand the context in which we are operating we are not likely to sort it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">As to what we are doing about it as a Government, we are, despite our severe financial difficulties, maintaining a public investment programme totalling €8.2 billion in direct Exchequer funding which is providing not only jobs but necessary improved economic infrastructure for this country.  That will not totally offset the reduction in activity in the private sector but it is an absolute prerequisite for making sure this economy is ready to take advantage of the upturn when it comes in the world economy, as an open economy such as ours can only do.  Our domestic consumer market will not be able to take the reduced activity in terms of what is available internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Let us be fair and honest about it, the Government is maintaining its commitment under the national development plan to provide for capital investment of between 5% and 6% of GDP, which is twice the average of any other government in Europe to which Deputy Gilmore might point in terms of what Government is contributing directly from Exchequer resources to building up infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">Regarding everything else we are doing in terms of retraining — Deputy Gilmore is running down other State agencies here as well — those agencies are providing good services for people who want other employment.  We have made changes to the back to education allowance, which has increased by 24% this year.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_82">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">I visited New York from 15 to 18 July 2008 during which I fulfilled a range of business, economic, cultural and community engagements.  I met with <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and prominent business media networks Bloomberg TV and CNBC to discuss economic issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">In my discussions and briefings with business contacts, I set out the action the Government is taking to maintain and enhance Ireland as an attractive location for foreign investment.  I also met with the heads of Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Tourism Ireland and we discussed their business strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">I also met with Mayor Bloomberg at City Hall.  He provided valuable insights into how the New York city administration operates.  I am hopeful that Mayor Bloomberg will be in a position to accept my invitation to him to visit Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">Over the course of my visit I repeated the priority I placed on the Ireland-US relationship and I announced a strategic review of this pivotal relationship, to maximise the benefits for everyone.  This review is being led by the ambassador to the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">Supporting our diaspora and addressing the plight of the undocumented in the US are key objectives of the Government.  During meetings with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and the Coalition of Irish Welfare Centres, we discussed ways in which we could try to help.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">I also visited the United States on 25 September, 2008 where I addressed the UN General Assembly.  I met with some members of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board in the course of my visit in July.  I expect to have a formal meeting with them during my next visit to the United States for St. Patrick's Day.  My Department remains in touch with the board through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish embassy in Washington.  The board is an important resource upon which the Government can draw, as required, for strategic advice, including personalised access to key contacts.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">Deputies will be aware that on 24 September, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, signed a memorandum of understanding establishing a new working holiday programme between Ireland and the United States.  The agreement represents a very significant and positive development in our migration arrangements and will help foster the growth of new and lasting contacts between young people from both countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">Over the coming weeks, I will meet with Senator Patrick Leahy and Congressman Richie Neal, chairman of the Friends of Ireland group and also with former Congressman Bruce Morrison when we will discuss those issues further.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">Earlier this morning, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, I sent a message of congratulations to President-elect, Barack Obama.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_58">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_92">Every government in the world is now preparing its plans to have a meeting with the new President Obama.  I am sure the Government will be in that mix.  It is only appropriate that the Taoiseach should send a message of congratulations on behalf of the Irish people to Barack Obama on his stunning election victory.  Is a possible visit to the White House envisaged on the schedule of international trips, in addition to the Taoiseach's traditional St. Patrick's Day business, or will a request be made by the Government that the Taoiseach will be facilitated in due course?  The Taoiseach might prefer to bring President-elect Obama to Moneygall or wherever as soon as possible.  I assume Mr. Obama will bring Vice President-elect Biden with him who has connections in my own part of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">Senator Obama has made comments about the taxation system in America and the consequences for American firms with investments abroad.  That has clear implications for Ireland where at least 100,000 people are directly employed in American industries based here.  Is the Taoiseach concerned about the comments made by President-elect Obama and is it his intention to convey to him our concerns in this regard or is there ongoing contact about the matter?</p>
            <p eId="para_94">I welcome the holiday arrangements made between the Irish and US Governments.  The defeated US presidential candidate, Senator McCain, had a real interest in immigration and legitimising the position of undocumented immigrants in the United States.  The problem still exists for the Irish and will not go away.  It is estimated that there are approximately 50,000 undocumented young Irish in the United States and there will probably be more because people are emigrating there again.  This is a cause of concern.  Does the Taoiseach have a strategy in place to work towards legitimising the undocumented Irish in the US who pay their way, have social security numbers and who may be married with school-going children?  They want to legitimise themselves and are prepared to pay for the privilege.  Do the Taoiseach and Department of Foreign Affairs have a strategy to build on the platform of the holiday visa arrangements and work towards legitimately documenting these people in the United States so that they can continue to pay their way there if that is where they want to live?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_59">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_95">As has been said, we hope to be in the United States next during the St. Patrick's Day celebrations.  I have no plans to visit in the meantime, but this may change according to circumstances.  We very much welcome the fact that, during our national celebrations, we have access to the incumbent in the office of President of the United States.  I hope this arrangement will continue as Senator Obama takes over.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">On the statements made during the course of the US presidential campaign on corporation tax policy, the Government has been tracking proposed or articulated changes.  The US-Ireland economic relationship is based on mutual benefit and we want this to continue.  Irish direct investment in the United States is estimated at €17 billion.  Employment by Irish companies in the United States is in excess of 70,000.  It is important to emphasise that, while the bilateral relationship is sometimes portrayed as very one-sided, we have seen the internationalising of Irish business and cross-investment into the United States by many substantial Irish companies.  This has resulted in the aforesaid figures.  There are over 510 US companies in Ireland, employing over 96,000 directly.  They have a considerable impact on the sub-supply sector also.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">It is important to point out that we have strong research and development links that benefit US companies in Ireland and also have clear advantages for Ireland.  We will monitor developments and keep in touch with the US Administration regarding any proposals that may emerge.  This issue arises from time to time and one must wait and see whether the political rhetoric of the presidential campaign translates into different policy positions that will have an impact on us.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">In the context of the global recession we face, we must guard against protectionism becoming a substitute for a policy of free trade that will provide a stimulus to world economic activity and growth.  While every administration and government has its own domestic policy priorities to identify and pursue, we will, on the basis of the excellent relationship we have enjoyed with successive US Administrations, continue to indicate the mutual benefit that derives from multinational investment in Ireland.  By definition, multinational investors locate in more than one country.  Clearly, Ireland has been identified by many companies — not just US companies — as an excellent location in which to do business.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">I was in Carlow last Monday to see work commence on a €200 million investment by Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, which itself has had a 32-year relationship with Ireland.  The company's location of its vaccine facility in Ireland, thereby benefiting Carlow and its hinterland, is an indication of the excellent people we have.  Importantly, the company would say it is also due to the ability to execute its projects within the demanding timelines it sets.  This is a credit to the IDA and local authorities, which ensured the planning arrangements and other necessary services infrastructure were put in place in a timely manner and in a competent way that facilitated such a major investment by a company that has had such a good relationship with Ireland for so long.  This company's experience reflects the wider benign experience of US companies in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">Even in these stringent times, we have increased the research and development tax credit from 20% to 25%, as announced in the budget by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  This is a further indication of our commitment to strengthening that relationship and ensuring the research and development capacity of many high-technology companies can be realised, where appropriate, in Ireland.  We should ensure the country serves as a platform from which to gain access not only to European markets, but also to Asian, Pacific and Middle Eastern markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">People worry about designated tax havens but Ireland is certainly not one.  Irish corporation tax revenues arise from the profits of companies, including multinationals, which in turn result from the companies' economic activities here and the efforts of the staff who work for them.  Our system is transparent, deliberately, so all can see the attractions and benefits to the State.  Other states often have high nominal rates of corporation tax, as Deputies know, but they mask the true lower rate in deductions and deals with individual firms.  That is not how the Irish system operates.  We are bound by the same rules on state aid, codes of conduct and rulings of the European Court of Justice as all EU member states.  In other words, the EU treaty contains specific rules on the provision of aid by member states to industry.  The European Union has a code of conduct, a political agreement, designed to curb harmful competition in business taxation.  It is similar to the process at OECD level and we are fully in compliance with both the code and OECD process.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">We have positive rates of tax.  We have 44 tax treaties in place and a system for the full exchange of information and proper regulation of activities to the highest standards.  We have a comprehensive taxation system covering income, capital and indirect taxes and we have concentrated in recent years on lowering the burden on enterprise and employment in order to encourage economic activity.  We maintain a low general corporation tax rate by ensuring a wide tax base and careful management of the public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">The rate, 12.5%, is a general rate and is not focused on any particular segment of Irish industry.  We do not distinguish between small and large enterprises or between enterprises that service the local economy and those with a multinational focus.  It is important to point out that the United States was Ireland's second largest merchandise trade partner in 2007, with bilateral trade valued at $31.5 billion and trade and services between Ireland and the United States worth $36.9 billion in 2006, the most recent year for which there are figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">It is important to point out that there is not one-way traffic.  A matured Irish economy has been cross-investing into the United States, as one would expect given the bilateral trade and investment flows.  We need to continue to make these points so there will be a full and up-to-date understanding of the precise mutually beneficial impact of the relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">On the question on the working holiday visa, it is our intention to build on the advance in this regard.  I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs on our diplomatic efforts to ensure the US Administration was receptive to the idea.  The issue of immigration reform in the United States is very difficult politically and we must respect that.  The issue presents difficulties for both parties in the US Congress.  As has been said, we appreciate the efforts of Senators McCain and Kennedy on their initiative, which, unfortunately, did not meet with ultimate success but which has provided continued momentum and impetus on this issue on behalf of those of our citizens who seek regularisation as quickly as possible.  We will work with the incoming US Administration and everybody in Capitol Hill to try to build consensus in respect of what I recognise as a very difficult domestic issue in US politics.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_60">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_106">I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  I heard some of the remarks made by Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme at the event in Carlow that the Taoiseach attended last Monday.  The point was also made in respect of the quality and the range of infrastructure available.  An unintended consequence of the economic difficulties we face has been the drop in construction costs.  Over the past number of years many firms have pointed out to me their dismay at the exceptionally high level of inflated construction costs which was not an incentive to locate here in the first place purely from the physical infrastructural point of view.  It is important that the Taoiseach bear in mind the cost increases incurred in energy, transport and communications for firms such as this one and for all firms which are above average.  The Government should see to it that where possible these costs are kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">When the Taoiseach attended the United Nations function he launched the Government's task force report on hunger.  That made three specific points, namely, the need to increase agricultural production in Africa, the need to target maternal and child under-nutrition and the need to bring about changes in governance and leadership priorities.  Arising from that, the recommendation made to Government was that we should work towards an indicative target of 20% of overseas development aid going towards the alleviation and eradication of hunger.  In fairness to Government, it has maintained impetus towards achievement of the target of 0.7% of GNP in terms of overseas development aid.  Does the Taoiseach see a point where 20% of overseas development aid from our resources will be targeted towards alleviation and eradication of hunger?</p>
            <p eId="para_108">Concerning the election yesterday in the United States, given President-elect Obama's roots his presidency will have a considerable capacity to transform the continent of Africa.  His being able to tap the frustrations of millions of people into the democratic cause can have a real impact on the kind of report that the Taoiseach launched at the UN.  Is the Taoiseach happy that the current methods of expenditure and the impact achieved are what we wish to see in respect of those persons from Ireland who give of their time and money?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_61">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_109">The task force on hunger report that we launched was very well received and the event was attended by many influential heads of relevant international organisations dealing with this area on behalf of the UN and some of its agencies.  It was seen as a constructive contribution to the debate.  Clearly what we seek are allies for the arguments we make and we will pursue diplomatically the objectives we set ourself in that task force in order to find others.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">Much development aid is best achieved in terms of outputs and outcomes when we co-ordinate efforts and where governments come together and work hand in hand.  Thereby an even greater critical mass of individual effort is put to a collective approach often used in terms of government to government aid.  In this way we insist and obtain commitments on transparency and outputs etc. by working with other like-minded countries such as Sweden and others in terms of how we develop our aid programmes in many of these countries.  Much of our aid is concentrated on least developed countries and the alleviation of poverty has always been a strong component in the policy framework we are implementing.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">Specifically regarding the ambitious target to move 20% to this particular area, we will work to that over time.  The overseas development aid section will do that and it is important to point out, as Deputy Kenny did, that much of the emphasis is not simply about the need for emergency aid, important as it is in terms of the human tragedy, whether today in Congo or in any other part of the world where famine ravages a population.  For some nations this is almost a perennial problem.  The real solution is the Chinese idea of not merely providing the fish today but of providing the fishing rods for people to fish for themselves tomorrow.  That is sustainable development into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">In the task force report we identified the fact that many of the farmers of Africa are women and that support for women in agriculture is the best guarantee of enhancing productivity in African agriculture.  We need to ally that to the new technologies that will assist in building production in these countries and organising agriculture on a sustainable basis to provide for families.  There have been indications of where that works, Uganda and some other countries being good examples.  In the priority countries we have identified we intend to work with other partners who provide development aid in order to add critical mass to our efforts and bring a more co-ordinated approach that will best guarantee better outcomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">All that Deputy Kenny said is well taken.  One must understand also that this is becoming an even more acute problem in the context of higher commodity and food prices.  Many who formerly exported rice now just have sufficient for themselves because of the price involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">A big change has taken place in terms of food security.  In the 1970s and 1980s there was an understanding in this part of the world that surplus food production existed and we should simply provide from that surplus to those countries that needed it.  There were, of course, different dietary and other considerations involved.  Export refunds, now happily eliminated, were another sophisticated means of dumping onto those markets at the expense of domestic producers in those countries.  That policy was also not sustainable.  The issue of food security is now back at the top of the agenda because of the impact of recent developments.  The conversion of food production to energy production is also having an impact, not only within developing countries but also in developed economies such as the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">All of this is very intricate and involved but it is an area in which Ireland can provide a leadership role.  It should not underestimate its influence, given our background and our track record in many of those parts of the world where we have been active, not only officially but through missionary work over many generations.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">Does the Taoiseach have any plans to meet with President Obama in advance of that or does he plan to talk to him on the telephone in the next few days?</p>
            <p eId="para_119">There was talk during the election campaign in the United States about possible changes in the tax regime for American companies  investing overseas.  The Labour Party shares and will support the approach that I understand the Taoiseach proposes to take in this matter.  I wish to explore this a little further.  I heard the Taoiseach today, and also heard the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, putting emphasis on the significant extent of Irish investment in the United States.  The Taoiseach mentioned, and we all suspect it to be the case, that there may have been some election rhetoric in what was said about the taxation issue.  One of the issues of concern to me is that US President-elect Obama seemed to have spelled out in some detail his thinking on the taxation regime for companies investing overseas, specifically in the half-hour televised advertisement he did.  If he were to proceed along those lines, is the Taoiseach suggesting corresponding measures could be taken here in respect of the taxation regime for companies investing in the United States?  Is that the logic of putting the issue on the table?</p>
            <p eId="para_120">On the reports published over the weekend indicating that the Government intends to take a more vigorous approach to the inspection by the Garda Síochána of military aircraft and aircraft transporting military personnel through Shannon Airport, I read that it is intended that there will be unannounced inspections of such aircraft.  Is it the Government's intention to proceed with this arrangement, as reported at the weekend?</p>

            <p eId="para_123">I always try to be helpful within the rules.  On Deputy Gilmore's first point, I am not suggesting for a moment that we would take actions that would be regarded as in any way hostile to US investment in Ireland.  It would not be in our national interests to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_125">While I accept that things are said in campaign speeches, I do not minimise the import of what has been said.  I do not wish to draw conclusions which may be adverse to our interests as to do so would be to take a leap too far.  As I stated, this type of issue has arisen in the past in terms of treatment of tax treaties, etc., and we have always negotiated, worked and used the goodwill of our relationship to help inform discussions and ensure people see that the arrangement is a mutual benefit which reflects genuine economic activity.  Sometimes changes in tax treaties arise because in the case of designated tax havens there is seen to be a diversion of funds in the absence of activity.  This is very hard to justify.  However, that is not the position in terms of the US investment trend in Ireland — quite the contrary.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">Regardless of which candidate won the election, the United States has a budgetary issue because a serious deficit has arisen.  There are also fewer savings and far greater consumption.  The incoming US Administration, as in the case of every other administration, faces huge budgetary challenges in the context of the international financial and economic crisis.  I recall a conversation I had with Mr. Robert Rubin, a former Treasury Secretary who is president of Citigroup, when I met him in the context of an important investment his company was making in an international e-banking project.  The project is being conducted from the company's Irish operation and I compliment it on its success in obtaining this type of work from such a reputable organisation.  Mr. Rubin said that generally speaking the budgetary issue would have to be addressed regardless of who was President Bush's successor.  This, he said, would involve consideration of the usual expenditure issues as well as taxation issues.  Again, nothing further was said apart from this general point, which is quite obvious.  In view of the commitments and expenditure programmes in which it is engaged, the budgetary and economic challenge facing the United States, as resilient and successful an economy as it has proven to be, is no less than it was in the past.  It is perhaps even greater in some respects.</p>
            <p eId="para_127">On the Deputy's final point, the group of Ministers which has been meeting on this matter is advancing the programme of Government commitments and indicating the way in which this is being done.  We have been happy to rely on the assurances given to us by the outgoing administration that rendition is not taking place through our airports.  The Government will take the opportunity to inquire as to the intentions of the incoming US Administration regarding the continuance of operations in Guantanamo Bay and, as a friendly country, seek assurances in whatever way we can confirming compliance with human rights requirements, including on the issue of torture etc. and information on the activities and policies the incoming administration intends to pursue to ensure such issues do not remain on the agenda in the international arena.</p>

            <p eId="para_128">On the Taoiseach's final point, I acknowledge that the Government has sought such assurances in the past and has raised the issue of Guantanamo Bay with the US Administration.  In terms of the new administration, is it envisaged to go beyond the type of assurances that have been sought in the past?  Specifically, is it intended to establish a regime of inspections which press reports at the weekend indicated was the Government's intention?</p>
            <p eId="para_129">Does the Taoiseach intend to make direct contact with President-elect Obama?  While I appreciate these are still early days, if President-elect Obama is to follow the precedent set by the Taoiseach, it will probably take a couple of weeks to conclude celebrations.</p>

            <p eId="para_134">The questions relate to the future and the Taoiseach's visit to New York in July.  I was a little puzzled as to the purpose of that visit, which was, I understand, his first visit abroad as Taoiseach.  Despite this, he did not travel to the capital city of the United States and I did not note any great political content in the visit.  I was, however, struck by some of the Taoiseach's comments while in New York, particularly as they were made as recently as mid-July.  For example, he stated in an interview that the Irish banking system was "very well capitalised".</p>

            <p eId="para_136">In that case, I will summarise rather than quote the Taoiseach directly.  On 17 or 18 July, he informed people in the United States that the Irish banks were very well capitalised and would not need Government support.  He also indicated that he expected the economy to return to a growth rate of 3% to 4% after 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_141">It is not like Deputy Gilmore to fail to press home a point when he has material in his hand.  I know he paraphrased me as the word he ascribes to me was not used.  I wish to set out the situation more accurately.  I do not have plans to speak to President-elect Obama.  On behalf of the Irish people, Government and Parliament, I have congratulated him on his success and extended our commiserations to his opponent.  I do not believe in extending the courtesy beyond that but the President-elect will be aware of our views and best wishes.  There is nothing more to add to that for the moment.  As I indicated, there are no other plans.  Should I have the pleasure of meeting President-elect Obama on some occasion beforehand, that will be fine but it is best to leave matters as they are for the moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">On the Deputy's question about my visit to New York, the purpose of my trip was to recognise the success of Irish Americans in business.  I was invited to attend there, which I did.  The visit was well received.  I took the opportunity to meet many welfare groups on the question of immigration reform and related issues — the usual people we consult with on such visits.  There is a very strong Irish community in New York and the general metropolitan area and one is not obliged to attend the capital on one's first visit, as leader of any party, unless it is the capital of the west, Galway city or somewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">On the issue of rendition, the Cabinet committee on aspects of international human rights met as part of its three month review of the programme for Government commitments.  We are, of course, totally opposed to extraordinary rendition.  The committee has agreed that early contact should be made with the new US Administration to seek a clear statement of intent that extraordinary rendition would cease and not resume during the new President's term of office.  I must emphasise we have no reason to doubt existing assurances in respect of the use of Irish airports.  We are looking for a general policy statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">Commitments are also being sought as regards the closure of Guantánamo Bay and the prohibition of intensive interrogation techniques such as water boarding, which are internationally considered to constitute torture.  We have asked the Irish ambassador in Washington to follow up on this in the course of his work.  With a view to strengthening, as necessary, the legislative provisions, the committee is also to review the statutory powers currently available to the civil and police authorities regarding the search and inspection of aircraft in the context of the obligations on the State under the Chicago Convention.  Of course, getting changes in the Chicago Convention requires the agreement of all parties, but we will work on all of these issues in good faith in line with the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">I join with other voices in the House in welcoming the election of Barack Obama as the first African-American President-designate of the United States.  It is an historic victory that is an enormously important step for the people of the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">Does the Taoiseach agree the President-elect will have widespread support across the globe for his signalled policy of phased withdrawal of US troops from Iraq?  Has the Taoiseach already, in the course of his engagements with the current regime in the United States, or will he, in the advent of the new Administration, impress the Irish people's view as part of that global assent to the effect that this is something the new President should pursue in the early course of his presidency?</p>
            <p eId="para_148">The issue of the inspection of flights at Shannon has been raised.  All I want to say about that is that it has been reported that the Government will initiate talks with the new Administration.  If the Taoiseach is to initiate talks as regards the whole question of the use of flights through Shannon to accommodate extraordinary rendition, at what level will such engagement take place?  Is it his intention to initiate talks or are the reports without foundation?  What exactly is the position and is it not the case, whatever about the issue of talks, that the Government has within its gift the powers and in my view, the responsibility, to initiate Garda checks of flights through Shannon and that no additional powers or further engagement are required?  It has the legal right to carry out such inspections and all that has prevented that happening heretofore is the political will to do it — the Government accepting assurances that had been given heretofore by the Bush Administration.  Will the Taoiseach clarify the situation and indicate to the House if he is willing to give the necessary go-ahead for occasional inspections at the very least by gardaí in order to establish the value of the Government's view of the assurances given by the Bush Administration?  It is absolutely essential that this is done.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">Regarding the contribution on "Morning Ireland" today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, where he stated the new Administration offered hope of a renewed role by the United Nations, can the Taoiseach indicate how the Government intends to see such a development come into effect?</p>

            <p eId="para_150">The question of US policy in Iraq is a matter for the United States.  I point out that all troops there are there at the request of the democratically elected Iraqi Government on foot of UN resolutions, so we have moved on considerably from the initial situation.  These are matters for the bilateral arrangements that exist between the Iraqi Government and the United States, as regards what is best in the interests of the US and the security of Iraq.  That is an important consideration for that region and indeed for the wider world.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">As regards Shannon, we of course do not accept there is any extraordinary rendition, nor is there any evidence of such going on through Irish airports.  We accept fully the assurances that we have been given at the highest level of the US Administration regarding that fact.  We are simply, as I indicated in a previous statement, seeking a general policy statement for the future from the incoming Administration.  We are taking the opportunity of a change in the US Administration to see whether that is available to us as a means of assuaging any public concerns in this area and also to reiterate the well-established policy position of our Government on these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">As regards what the Minister for Foreign Affairs had to say, obviously he and his Department have been monitoring the speeches and statements of President-elect Obama during the course of the campaign.  He has indicated his approach in broad terms to work with partners throughout the world to deal with many of the global issues, recognising that the United States has a leadership role to play.  We should allow a settling in period for the new Administration, hear an enunciation of its policy positions and then work with it in so far as we can.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs was simply indicating his hope that there are good grounds for believing we shall see the type of approach emanating that he flagged in his interview, based on the speeches his Department has monitored during the course of this campaign.</p>

Will he not agree that the question of extraordinary rendition has not been substantively addressed and the virtual innocent acceptance of the assurances from the Bush Administration in no way addresses the concerns of the Irish people?  As regards the assertion that no evidence exists, the Government is certainly not looking for any, that is for sure.  This is something that needs to be addressed.  Surely the departure of President George W. Bush offers an opportunity for a new beginning and a new approach, which I urge.</p>

If so, what was the nature of the discussions that took place between them, as I understand there were some?  Did the discussions, in the event, raise two particular issues, the first being the concerns within Europe, as well the United States about the possibility of Iran developing a nuclear weapon?  Iran's continuous sabotaging of attempts to progress a successful Middle East peace process, particularly between Israel and the Palestinians and Israel and the Syrians, is an issue of substantial concern.  If there were such discussions, will the Taoiseach tell us what was said on behalf of the Government and what was said to him?  In the context of the Taoiseach's visit to the United States, was this issue raised?  Were the possible Iranian nuclear threat and the interference of Iran in the Middle East peace process raised by American politicians with the Taoiseach during recent visits?</p>

            <p eId="para_161">With regard to the questions asked by Deputy Ó Caoláin, there is no basis for his contention that the Garda does not do its duty in the matter in question just as in other matters.  The Garda, if it is to act lawfully, can only act on reasonable suspicion and cannot act on any other basis.  The assurances we have received from a friendly country, namely, the United States, are ones we accept and respect.  It is important we do so.  We cannot call on the United States to do this, that and the other when it comes to Irish affairs and then suggest it is acting in bad faith on other matters, particularly when we receive clear and unequivocal assurances, assurances that are freely and expeditiously given.  There is no empirical evidence whatsoever for the contention.  The majority of the people accept such assurances from a friendly country, given the excellent relationship we have enjoyed with the United States.  I make no apology for saying that.  There are some who seek the support of America when it suits them and who have other things to say when it suits them also, but that is not the approach I take.  I accept what is said on its merits, in the spirit in which it is said.  In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, one can draw rational and logical conclusions from what is said and we should do so in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">On the question of whether Senator Barack Obama will ever visit Ireland, he is welcome to do so at any time.  Should he do so, quite apart from the political work he would undertake, if he wished to take the opportunity to call to that part of the country from where his predecessor, Falmouth Kearney, emanated — not someone who is on the books of the Moneygall GAA club — we would be more than happy to facilitate that visit.  An unfortunate development in recent times is that while Moneygall is very much part of County Offaly, it will be part of the Tipperary North constituency in the next elections.  Hopefully, it will return to its true home as quickly as possible.</p>

Were we to meet in our bilateral relations with the Republic of Iran at ministerial level, we would, of course, reiterate strongly the common position of the European Union on the continuing refusal of Iran to comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency's, IAEA, requirements.  We wish to facilitate the use of nuclear technology for the purpose of civilian use, should Iran so wish, on a transparent basis and under the conditions required by the various treaties that apply on non-proliferation, etc.  We acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of such technology for any other purpose would create a serious security risk for the region, one that must be avoided at all costs.  We must pursue the diplomatic efforts being made in the clear knowledge of the need for compliance with these requirements in the interest of all concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">This is not an issue that has been raised with me by US politicians in recent times.  However, one is aware of the deep concerns in the United States with regard to the Middle East generally.  I agree it would be far better if everyone in the region was to act constructively in an effort to find a permanent solution to the problem in the Middle East, one that would involve the establishment of a viable Palestinian state and provide full security for the State of Israel.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise the following matter of serious national importance, namely, the fact that nine patients in the north east had a missed diagnosis of lung cancer, thus losing valuable time for their essential medical treatment, that at least one of these patients would have had a major chance of their cancer being cured, that others had their lives shortened by a valuable period of months and that eight of these patients have since died; and the need now for an independent inquiry into why a clear warning given seven years ago by a consultant radiologist to the health authorities that the radiologists in the hospitals concerned were under intolerable stress, that a dangerous situation existed for patients and staff and that mistakes would be made was ignored by the same health authorities.</p>

The first is her decision to cancel the vaccination programme for young girls against cervical cancer.  The announcement of the cancellation of the vaccination programme is surprising, given that it is only three months since she announced the programme was to go ahead.  The House should hear an explanation from the Minister about that today.</p>

There are reports that the Minister said yesterday that some drugs currently available under the medical card will be removed from the list and that some medications and treatments available under the drugs refund scheme will be removed from the scope of that scheme.  The Minister should be given the opportunity to come to the House today to offer an explanation and respond to questions from Members.</p>

Consultants, doctors, nurses and support staff are placed in intolerable working conditions.

          <p eId="para_208">In respect of promised legislation, which is the second issue raised by Deputy Kenny, the programme for Government commits the Government to legislating for civil partnership.  We will fulfil that commitment within the current constitutional context and developing case law.  It is imperative to stress that the general scheme of the civil partnership Bill has been drafted within a constitutional framework that gives express protection to the institution of marriage.  The Government's legislative programme provides for the publication early next year of a civil partnership Bill.  The Attorney General has provided advice throughout the drafting process to ensure that the constitutional position on marriage is fully respected and in no way undermined.  Civil partnership is a separate and distinct scheme which does not conflict with the special position of marriage.</p>

The Taoiseach will be aware that one such school is already in existence without the strength of law behind it.  The legislation is No. 32 on yesterday's Order Paper.  It is a simple Bill which was written by one of our specialists and, given that the Minister for Education and Science cannot bring forward legislation on the matter until late 2009, I invite the Taoiseach to consider adopting it and bringing it forward in Government time.  I do not believe it will divide the House.  It simply legalises a situation that already exists on the ground in north County Dublin.</p>

The Minister of State might clarify the position.  We want two separate agencies.  Charities work on the ground day to day while State charities are under the control of the Minister, and the latter should be under a separate agency.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_285">These amendments were raised on Committee Stage from the perspective that the independence of the charitable sector might be undermined by not excluding statutory bodies from charitable status altogether.  It is the case that some statutory bodies currently enjoy eligibility for charitable tax reliefs on foot of decisions by the Revenue Commissioners.  The proposed amendments would result in such bodies losing their existing entitlement to certain charitable tax exemptions, which is not the intent of the Bill.  I am surprised that amendments were proposed that would affect in a negative way the status of a charity.  The Bill is silent on the organisational or legal structure that any charity should have so as not to be too prescriptive and to leave it to charities to choose the appropriate structures for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The Bill is consciously framed so the sole matters to be taken into consideration when making a determination as to whether the organisation is charitable are the following — the purpose of the organisation and whether there is a public benefit.  If statutory bodies meet the criteria to the satisfaction of the new authority, I see no reason they should not be accorded charitable status.  The status of the organisation, for example, whether it is incorporated, a trust or a statutory body, should not be the issue in making such determinations, as many voluntary charities also get a considerable amount of State funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">In a recently published research report by the Centre for Non-profit Management in TCD it was revealed that over two thirds of non-profit organisations in Ireland receive funding from the State.  This does not in any way undermine the independence of those charities or the charity sector as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">As well as opposing these amendments from a policy perspective, Deputies will be aware that in other Government Report Stage amendments to be moved, existing organisations that already have charitable tax exemptions — this will include some statutory bodies — will be automatically deemed to be registered as charities.  These amendments, if accepted, would also directly conflict with this approach.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendments.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_294">(<i>b</i>) a body that promotes a political cause, unless the promotion of that cause relates directly to the advancement of the charitable purposes of the body,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The definition of an excluded body currently in section 2(1) provides that a body, the principal purpose of which is to promote a political party, candidate or cause, cannot qualify as a charity.  The existing wording in the Bill was designed to allow charities to engage in valid political work as a means of achieving their charitable purpose rather than as a primary purpose in itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">On Committee Stage, there was much debate on the issue of charities and their interaction with political life.  While there seemed to be a general acceptance that charities should not support a political party or a political candidate for election, the discussion mainly centred on the reference to political cause.  I have reflected on this matter in the intervening period and I agree with my predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, who considered it inappropriate that charities should be predominantly engaged in political activities.  Their aim should be to achieve their charitable purpose by engaging in activities that directly help their targeted beneficiaries on the ground.  However, one must be pragmatic and recognise that there are times when a charity might reasonably consider it necessary to engage in what might be regarded as political activities as a means to furthering its charitable purpose, though such activities must never become the primary objective of the charity in their own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Since Committee Stage, in consultation with my legal advisers, we have developed the wording presented.  The proposed wording separates political candidate and party from political cause and, thus, provides greater clarity for charities.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Under the Government amendment, charities will not be permitted to support either a political candidate or a party.  This is only fitting.  They will be permitted to promote a political cause but only one relating directly to their charitable purpose.  A charity must take care not to become a political organisation, however, and should always remain focused on its charitable purpose, which must be, by definition, its only purpose.  Should the authority form the view that an organisation is no longer an exclusively charitable organisation but has become <i>de facto</i> a political organisation, the Bill would permit the authority to strike such an organisation off the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Although they are aimed at achieving a similar outcome, Government amendment No. 6 provides greater clarity than Deputy Wall's proposed amendments Nos. 7 and 15.  Therefore, I cannot accept them.  I commend amendment No. 6 to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_205">
          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_300">With the greatest respect, I suggest the Minister of State's amendment does not clarify any matter but rather makes it far more difficult.  I intend very much to facilitate the Minister of State and the Government in some of these amendments which are technical and, like Deputy Ring and others, we are anxious to improve the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">However, this is one of those fundamental issues.  The fundamental issue that arises is that, first, it is extraordinary to suggest it is possible to delimit and confine a political cause within a charitable purpose.  I will give a practical example which might be of assistance.  In doing so, I indicate, lest there be any difficulty about it, that my daughter works for Trócaire as a campaigns officer.  For example, on a day like today, if one was to run a campaign against slavery, it is an issue that would arise in regard to trade, debt and so forth or in regard to bondage, bonded labour and so forth.  It is not clear whether that comes within the Minister of State's definition — it may well do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">We ran into difficulty previously as to where advocacy begins and ends.  The issue arose particularly with a campaign concerning young girls in regard to a Trócaire advertisement, which was struck down by an intervention in regard to advertising by RTE.  The advertisement had to be withdrawn and restructured.  Effectively the Government amendment construes "political" as meaning "party political".  Deputy Wall's amendment went very far.  It went with the Government regarding the issue of political party and political person.  It is fundamental that we cannot concede on the issue of cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">What has the general sense given to "cause" included?  It includes matters such as climate change, sustainable development, aid, trade, debt, slavery, child labour and so forth.  If I accepted the Government amendment No. 6, it would always be suggested that a body had overstepped its reach regarding charitable status in collecting and that it should not take on a particular cause.  What it is not stating is even more important.  It is not stating that a body can do all the advocacy it likes as long as it is within the framework of the existing <i>status quo</i>.  It cannot go beyond the <i>status quo</i> of its expressed compassion or charity and go into the realm of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I have been involved in the general development area for a long time, and I do not say this about the Minister of State's party.  I remember in the days of Bishop Casey when Trócaire was campaigning in Central America and elsewhere.  Many people stood up in this House and asked whether this was what the organisation was established to do.  What it did for human rights was crucial and the broader tasks of advocacy are very important.  In order to save considerable time on this issue of advocacy expressed in its more general sense, I must insist on the right to protect cause, even though I am conceding political party and person.  I will also do the same on a later amendment on human rights.  I am doing this by way of housekeeping.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">I spoke on Second Stage and having spent a long time considering the matter with the various bodies that made representations, including the Irish Council of Civil Liberties and many others, I have decided that these are very important points.  I also believe that the Minister of State can achieve what he has said he wants to achieve by conceding on this fundamental single word, "cause".  That is all that divides us and it is extraordinarily inflexible not to yield on it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_306">I agree with Deputy Higgins.  I tabled an amendment on the matter on Committee Stage.  It was the one matter on which we all received considerable lobbying because charities are concerned.  Only one word divides us.  Even at this stage I ask the Minister of State to reconsider it.  Charities are doing a job and if they want to advocate for some kind of policy on a matter that is affecting people here or in another country, they should have the right to lobby for that.  They should not need to be concerned that by doing that they would lose their charitable status because the Government of the day does not like the policy of the agency.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider.  We do not want to divide the House on the matter but charities are very anxious that it be clarified.  We do not want the Bill to result in charities looking over their shoulders wondering when Big Brother or the Government will step on them some day.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the matter.  Deputy Higgins has outlined the case very well and I support him.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_307">I recognise that this matter was raised on both Second and Committee Stages.  It has been considered.  It is not an easy area with which to deal and has proved somewhat complex.  Based on the legal advice we received, I believe the amendment as tabled is a good way to achieve what we set out to do.  Section 2(1) states that "a political party, or a body, the principal object of which is to promote a political party, candidate or cause", is excluded from being regarded as a charitable organisation.  I believe most people are happy with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The relevant wording in the Bill was designed to allow a charity to engage in valid political work as a means of achieving its charitable aims, but not as its primary activity.  The authority will ultimately decide whether the objective of an organisation is the pursuit of a political cause and any decision taken by the authority in this regard may be appealed to the charity appeals tribunal or to the High Court.  The amendment we have tabled represents a good outcome.  We have taken legal advice and we must stick with the amendment as it stands.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_309">This is a fundamental issue.  There is a parallel in the history of legislation.  In 19th century Britain, for example, some people were interested in charitably dealing with the victims of child labour, including children being sent up chimneys.  However, the campaigns that were important were those that outlawed child labour rather than the ones that were delimited in terms of some kind of philanthropic intent, however well merited.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I appeal to the Minister of State to recommit the Bill in respect of this amendment.  The Minister of State would lose nothing by conceding the word "cause".  However, we are expressing confidence in those NGOs that have approached us.  NGOs, charitable organisations and others have enough to do.  They will not deliberately seek to go beyond their main work.  It might be said that we need to protect them from themselves.  By saying that, the Minister of State would be saying that he is putting the boundary around what they might do.  I prefer to operate on the basis of trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">There is a philosophical problem regarding this matter.  The activity in the charitable area is residual and comes about in terms of issues about the structures of society.  It would be a very great limitation not to be able to locate one's cause and change the structure of society in areas such as child labour, slavery, trade or the abuse of bonded labour.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">For the sake of housekeeping and given that we need to move on, I will oppose amendment No. 6.  I hope to move amendment No. 7 without the need to repeat my arguments, which are the same ones I have made.  I am sorry that I cannot give way on the issue.  I again appeal to the Minister of State to agree to recommit the Bill in respect of this amendment as is happening in respect of certain other amendments.  There would be an opportunity to avoid a division if he were willing to concede that much.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_453">"(iii) contrary to public policy,".</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The Government is proposing amendments Nos. 8 and 47 on the basis of legal advice.  The Bill already provides for the automatic exclusion of certain categories of organisations, including bodies engaged in illegal activities.  The advice provided is that there are other types of activities that would be regarded as contrary to public policy.  Such activities, while not illegal, should not be accorded recognition by the law and should not be regarded as charitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I wish to make a clear distinction between "public policy" and "Government policy".  Public policy transcends the policy of Government of the time.  Under the Charities Bill, an organisation will not be excluded from charitable status because it advocates a course of action contrary to Government policy.  Activities contrary to public policy will be only those which do not deserve recognition in law.  Murdoch, in <i>A Dictionary of Irish Law,</i> states that certain acts are said to be contrary to public policy when the law refuses to enforce or recognise them on the grounds that they are injurious to the interests of the State or the community, for example, the law will not enforce an illegal contract or permit evidence to be given which would affect the security of the State.  I emphasise that the references here are to the State and not to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Also, statutes frequently contain reference to the phrase "contrary to public policy".  A recent example is the Arbitration Bill 2008 which incorporates a model law for all arbitrations in Ireland.  Article 34 of the model law provides that an arbitration agreement may be set aside if it is contrary to public policy.  The point applies even more strongly in the context of charities.  If Irish law will not give force to agreements which are contrary to public policy, it would be illogical if organisations advancing activities contrary to public policy could be given the much greater legal privilege of being recognised as charities.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Given the legal advice provided, it is considered prudent and desirable to exclude from charitable status, by way of amendment No. 8, organisations engaged in activities contrary to public policy.  Amendment No. 47 arises as a consequence of the primary amendment and is necessary to ensure consistency with the new definition of "excluded body".</p>

The amendment seeks to extend consideration beyond the State.  I am interested to hear the Minister's response in regard to this matter which was raised on Committee Stage.  The point being made is that while one can legislate for that which is in one's own jurisdiction, particular kinds of activities and promotions may have the consequence of addressing issues abroad and so on.  For this reason, it may be necessary that we try to push the boundary of care in order to be as inclusive as possible.  I am interested to hear the Minister's response in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">I move amendment No. 12:<entity refersTo="#bill.2007.31.dail.4.amd_12" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_472">In page 10, to delete lines 18 and 19 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_473">""registered charitable organisation" means—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_474">(<i>a</i>) a charitable organisation that is registered in the register, or</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_475">(<i>b</i>) a charitable organisation that, by virtue of <i>section 39</i>, is deemed to be registered in the register;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The Government proposes a technical amendment, No. 12, on the basis of legal advice.  In section 2, for the purpose of clarity, I propose to delete lines 18 and 19 on page 10 and insert the proposed amendment.  This will enable those who have been awarded charitable tax exemption by the Revenue on the basis of their charitable status to be deemed to be registered by the authority until their charitable credentials can be endorsed by the authority in accordance with the Act.  That particular matter has caused much concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The Government is proposing amendment No. 32 on the basis of legal advice.  The technical amendment proposed will provide clarity to section 38(4), in which the words "A charitable organisation" are replaced with "Subject to <i>section 39</i>, a charitable organisation”.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Amendment No. 55 sets out the circumstances under which the authority may remove a deemed organisation from the register.  The new section mirrors that applicable to other non-deemed organisations in section 40 of the Bill as approved on Committee Stage in that the authority may remove an organisation where it has become an excluded body for the purposes of the Act; changes its name without the consent of the authority; has been convicted of an indictment or offence; has failed to comply with the accounts, reporting or audit provisions; has failed to comply with a request from the authority to provide information; has ceased to be a charitable organisation by an order of the High Court; or has a charity trustee who has become disqualified from holding such a position, also by order of the High Court.  Similar provisions also apply to non-deemed organisations, ensuring an equitable approach overall.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">With regard to amendment No. 44, it has been recognised that under the Bill as currently worded there is potentially a significant challenge for both the authority in setting up the initial register and the sector in complying with requirements as regards registration, etc.  The framing of this legislation has always been based on the recognition that the vast majority of charities are small and may not have the resources to cope with a significant additional administrative burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I am also conscious there are some concerns, although I am confident there is no genuine basis for them, that some existing charities could lose their status when the Charities Bill is enacted and commenced.  To address both these matters, I propose this amendment, which provides that any organisation holding a current CHY number from Revenue will be automatically deemed to be registered.  I am sure this will allay any concerns that may have been felt by individual charities as regards their eligibility for charitable status when regulation is introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">To go into the detail of the amendment in question, there is provision for transfer of information between Revenue and the authority relating to deemed charities.  There is a reverse power for the authority to request information from the charities where necessary.  There is an enabling provision similar to that already in the Bill relating to non-deemed charities for the authority to impose a fee to meet any costs arising to it as a consequence of the registration process.  The advice to me is that it would be remiss not to include such a provision, although I stress it is merely an enabling measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">There are equivalent provisions in terms of the information the authorities shall enter into on the register in respect of deemed charities.  These mirror the information that will be entered on the register for non-deemed charities.  Amendment No. 86 is technical, inserted on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General.  It defines charitable organisations with regard to non-cash collections and is part of the provisions of the Act which will bring non-cash collections within the scope of the collection permit system for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I will move this amendment and taken in conjunction with other provisions in the Act it will support an orderly and fair system of non-cash collections by charities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_484">As this is a recommittal, I will not make a long speech.  There has been media publicity on this matter and people have concerns.  I hope all genuine charities will be transferred.  Will the Revenue and the Minister of State's Department keep in constant contact?  There have been newspaper articles detailing how some charities were using their status to avoid tax.  I know the Revenue Commissioners had an investigation into this because I raised the matter during priority question time.  Has the Revenue Commissioners completed the investigation and has anybody been found to be using charitable status to avoid tax?</p>
          <p eId="para_485">I am concerned about the matter but I would also like to see genuine charities put on the register.  They have already dealt with the Revenue and have tax clearance certificates.  It should be a straight move to the register.  At the same time I hope the Minister of State's Department, along with the Revenue, will investigate if people are using charitable organisations in a bogus way or using such bodies to avoid tax.  I hope the Department will keep in constant contact with the Revenue Commissioners, who should be sure charities are above board.  If they are not, the charities should be dealt with by the law and the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_486">I am not disposed to opposing the amendments but I agree with one aspect of Deputy Ring's statement in particular.  As soon as possible after this legislation has passed through both Houses and is signed into law, it would be in the public interest to have a statement of clarification on the meaning of charitable status.  Deputy Ring is entirely right that there are ways in which it has been abused for benefit by individuals and corporations.  Such a clarification would be useful, although I accept these administrative amendments.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_487">I will not delay on these and I thank the Deputies for their comments.  The provisions in these amendments are very significant for ordinary charities.  One of their concerns was that on the first day there would be a backlog that could not be dealt with in an efficient and timely manner.  There were also concerns from smaller charities in particular that there would be an unnecessary burden in getting them into the system.  This attempts to get the system up and running for those already registered with the Revenue and, by and large, there is consensus that this is positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Deputy Ring raised the issue of Revenue.  Any investigations carried out by the Revenue Commissioners are entirely a matter for that body.  That would be the case with any investigation and not just one relating to charities.  During this time we will be working closely with Revenue and there will be a proposed working group.  There is provision in the Bill for consultation between Revenue and the new authority to be established.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_495">In page 11, line 9, after "community" to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_496">"including the advancement of human rights and the promotion of equality or for advancing social or economic policy".</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I am disposed towards insisting on this amendment, which would include the words, "including the advancement of human rights and the promotion of equality or for advancing social or economic policy" in section 3(1).  It is interesting that section 3(1) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_498">For the purposes of this Act each of the following shall, subject to <i>subsection (2)</i>, be regarded as being a charitable purpose:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_499">(<i>a</i>) the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Members already have gone into the issue as to whether this is a matter of charity or of justice.  However, this problem will resonate with them throughout their discussions in this regard.  Section 3(1)(<i>b</i>) cites “the advancement of education”, which historically includes questions pertaining to women’s education in 19th century Britain and section 3(1)(<i>c</i>) refers to “the advancement of religion”, which has its own problems later in the Bill in respect of definition.  One presumes that it is religion that is not of an oppressive kind and Members will deal later on with the specific issue of cults.  Section 3(1)(<i>d</i>) includes “any other purpose that is of benefit to the community”.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">In this amendment, Deputy Wall seeks to insert an additional line, "including the advancement of human rights and the promotion of equality or for advancing social or economic policy".  I refer to the history of the human rights movement, from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to the establishment of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, a post that was filled in a distinguished way by Mary Robinson.  I must declare an interest in that I hold an honorary adjunct professorship at the Irish Centre for Human Rights.  Surely the issue of human rights is important and should be promoted.  Consequently, non-governmental organisations and charities should have the right to promote it.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Equally, when one considers the promotion of equality, I have a real issue regarding the drift of Government policy.  I consider the inclusion of the Combat Poverty Agency within the Department of Social and Family Affairs simply to be the taming of advocacy.  Equally, I consider the changes regarding the Equality Authority to be quite corrosive of movements towards vibrant citizenship.  For that reason, one might reasonably ask why one cannot include the advancement of human rights, the promotion of equality or the establishment of social or economic policy?</p>
          <p eId="para_503">For example, I refer to the current debate as to whether one should have a market driven policy that regards society as a residuum or whether one should adopt a new version of a social economy.  The suggestion is that such issues cannot be included, while the advancement of religion and education, as well as the prevention of poverty or economic hardship are included.  One has reverted to the old notion in respect of worthy people, such as the Oxford movement, who in the old days used to travel from London to discover the poor.  They would engage in distribution, try to get them to uplift themselves and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Whether one likes it or not, a tremendous debate is under way in respect of the rights implications of our structures.  Human rights, where they are being discussed most seriously, are no longer confined to legal texts.  A genuine attempt is being made to move on from civil and political rights into economic, social and cultural rights.  This movement is taking place and includes people throughout the world who are struggling both to be recognised as human beings and for the right to live, to construct their way of life, to their own culture and so forth.  This pertains to the human rights side of the issue.  Within the developed countries, one has rights of bodies such as, for example, Travellers, children, special communities and so forth.  All these rights are being expressed by the non-governmental organisations and rights bodies as rights with responsibilities.  They are about participation, the democratic distribution of power and the manner in which one gives consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">On the other side, in respect of equality, there has been a great debate that has gone far past the poverty debate.  The question on equality asks what constitutes the equal participation of citizens in society in respect of education, health, transport and the rights of different people of different ages.  One then moves on to try to discuss forms of social and economic organisation and so on, as bodies may well do.  I refer, for example, to bodies that specifically discuss giving rights to elderly people and so forth.  Consequently, I do not understand how one can assert that the prevention or relief of poverty or economic hardship is permissible when it is much less than the matters to which I refer.  This is being concerned for the victims, the inequalities and frustrations of human rights having happened and so forth.  For that reason, I ask the Minister of State at least to consider amendment No. 14.  I cannot see how the Bill would be damaged by the inclusion of the wording suggested by Deputy Wall in this amendment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_506">When the heads of this Bill were drafted originally, the advancement of human rights, social inclusion and social justice were included in the general scheme of the Bill as charitable purposes.  However, these references were removed later and this is an issue that is of particular concern to the charity sector.  There are concerns that some charities, whose main focus is the prevention of the violation of human rights, may be excluded.  Deputy Higgins has explained the issue very well and those who are promoting human rights through the operation of charities should be protected in any way possible.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this amendment.  While Members do not wish to push this issue to a vote, they may be so obliged on the basis the Minister of State is not prepared to do something in this regard.  Great concern exists in this regard and those who deal with human rights do so for the good because no one else is available to represent such people and to fight for their causes.  Deputy Higgins has outlined this point very well and I support him.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this matter to ascertain whether the amendments under discussion can be taken on board.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" eId="spk_230" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_507">I thank Members for their contributions.  I am conscious of this issue and note it has taken up much time and debate on earlier Stages.  I am aware the definition of charitable purpose as outlined in section 3(8) has been the subject of much debate on previous Stages of the Bill and that of particular interest in that context has been the reference to human rights within that definition.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The Charities Bill has been consciously framed in order not to have a negative impact on any organisation that enjoys charitable status with the Revenue Commissioners at present.  The Bill endeavours to protect the status of organisations that at present are regarded as charities by ensuring the categories of charitable purposes in section 3 of the Bill reflect those that have developed in common law over many years and have been used by Revenue when considering eligibility for charitable tax exemptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">While the Bill does not seek to narrow such charitable purposes, neither does it seek to expand the range of charitable purposes.  The advancement of human rights or social justice is not a charitable purpose at present.  Revenue does not grant charitable tax exemptions to human rights organisations <i>per se</i>.  I understand that where it has granted exemptions to organisations that might be regarded by some as being human rights organisations, it has done so in the context of purposes relating to education or poverty, for example.  Where Revenue has made such determinations, the proposal to automatically deem such organisations as charities ensures that such charitable status is fully protected.  Consequently, organisations that already have charitable tax exemptions have nothing to fear from the new legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">I should point out that the Revenue Commissioners operate a separate tax exemption scheme for human rights bodies, but only for those that have consultative status with the United Nations.  I understand the only organisation that receives such recognition in Ireland is Amnesty International and its position will not be affected by the Bill.  I have specific concerns about the terminology proposed in the Opposition amendments.  I do not accept in Deputy Wall's amendment No. 14 that an organisation that is involved solely in the advancement of economic policy should be regarded as charitable in nature.  Regarding Deputy Ring's amendment No. 21, my advice is that social inclusion is already fully comprehended under section 3(8)(<i>k</i>) and that civic participation would be included within civic responsibility in section 3(8)(<i>c</i>).  In those circumstances I regret I cannot accept amendments Nos. 14 and 21.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">In the spirit of making progress and the best possible legislation, if the Minister had said to me he would examine the issue and would have included the advancement of human rights and the promotion of equality, I would have considered withdrawing the amendment on the grounds of the social or economic policy that is being applied.  The net effect of the non-acceptance of my amendment on human rights and equality means, in effect, as the Minister described it, which is no disrespect to him, that the Revenue Commissioners serve as a kind of <i>eminence grise</i> behind the legislative process.  It is not for them to prescribe what shall be the legitimate and endowed activities of any body in regard to human rights.  I am well aware of the extent of their willingness to define, for example, in regard to taxation benefit what is a work of artistic value.  They are entitled to express the remit of their own scheme but they are not entitled to define any activity.  People have provided work in music, arts and culture that they have not recognised.  That is their business to some extent and it expresses the narrow range of their remit but they are not entitled to put a boundary to the consideration and advancement of human rights nor of equality.  I do not intend to waste time by repeating my arguments.  I am pressing the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">This issue has received a lot of debate and discussion and for that reason it would not be fair to say we will re-examine the matter.  It is worth bearing in mind that this is new legislation and it will be reviewed in five years time.  It is important to remember that the charities legislation is intended to regulate existing charities.  The provision we have already passed allows any organisation that has current charitable status to retain it.  A key point is that there is no risk to existing charities.  It was not the intention to narrow the range of charitable purposes but neither are we seeking to expand them.  As a consequence of the "deemed" amendment, existing charities will retain their charitable status.  In that regard I regret the amendments cannot be accepted.</p>

            <p eId="para_645">My Department works closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the State agencies under its aegis, in promoting Ireland's economic interests overseas.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I attach the highest priority to using our network of embassies to further the Government's economic objectives, including attracting inward foreign investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">Our embassy in Washington and consulates in the United States work closely with the IDA in facilitating high level contacts and providing information on the extensive supports available to companies interested in investing in Ireland.  The IDA and the Irish Consulate in New York share a premises in Ireland House with other State agencies, thereby ensuring close collaboration in their efforts to attract foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">Every opportunity is used, including high-level visits and bilateral meetings, to raise and advance Ireland's economic interests in the United States.  In my recent visit I addressed business leaders at a luncheon in New York, where I met clients of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  I also met individual Irish companies which do business in the United States, and senior figures in the financial services sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">In all my contacts, I underlined the benefits of investing and doing business in Ireland.  I also drew attention to the increase in Irish investment in the United States and the development of the mutually beneficial economic relationship which this implies.  My key message was that Ireland is, and remains, an attractive location for high-end, skill-intensive investment.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
            <p eId="para_649">The Minister will know that approximately 152,000 people are employed directly in foreign companies that invest here and that approximately 300,000 are indirectly so employed.  Does he know what percentage of jobs created by foreign direct investment comes from the United States?  He may not have the exact figure today but my understanding is that approximately 40% of all jobs created by foreign corporations are in US-based companies.  Perhaps the Minister might let me have the figure later.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">There is much euphoria in Ireland as a result of the American presidential election.  Is the Minister concerned that the new US President may make a policy change as he has intimated, most particularly at the Democratic Convention in Colorado?  President-elect Obama stated that he may look at the concept of double-taxing companies that are based abroad.  I have concerns that the new US Administration may seek to put an additional charge on companies that invest abroad and that this might have major implications for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">It is very important that the Minister give me his view and that he outline what steps, if any, he might take to try to ensure that this very important economic sector does not come under threat.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_652">American investment in Ireland is very significant and over 100,000 jobs have been created by American companies.  The figures are available in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and can be supplied to the Deputy.  The key point is that it has been a significant factor, not merely in terms of quantity of investment but in the types of industries that have come in such as life sciences, technologies or internationally traded services.  The degree of expertise that has come with that and the mindsets acquired in how to organise human resources and more have been greatly beneficial to us.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">As Minister, I work with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to continue to seek ways of encouraging that investment, consolidating existing investments and winning new investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">Regarding President-elect Obama's position on taxation and the suggestion that the new administration may seek to disincentivise companies moving overseas in terms of deferral tax, subsidiaries and other means, we must take this step by step.  We must also be aware that such a policy change would require legislative input and we would obviously engage in making our position known to Congress and to public representatives there.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">The reason many multinationals go overseas is to win market share in big trading blocs.  American multinationals come to Europe to win market share in Europe.  They are in Asia to win market share in China and India.  There is, therefore, an interdependency.  The system is now a global one and is not that easily disassembled.  There is a journey to go yet on this matter and we must be cautious about overreacting.  We must certainly be mindful of the situation and will take steps to respond if necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_656">I am satisfied that the Minister is mindful and am glad to know that he will put a block in the first hurdle of President Obama's new policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">Former President Clinton also intimated a similar policy when he came to office in the early 1990s.  Is the Minister familiar with the steps we took, if any, at the time, or how far such a policy evolved during that period?</p>

The Minister might also supply me with figures at a later time in respect of the investment that Irish companies might have in the United States.  Perhaps he might also give a similar total figure for the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_662">I was very keen to get that figure when I was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in order to tell Enterprise Ireland to do some homework regarding how many jobs Irish companies create in the US.  The figure now is approximately 80,000 jobs.  It is by no means a one-way street.  I had the unusual circumstance about a year and a half ago of a US Senator lobbying me to see if a particular company might locate in his jurisdiction.  That was an unusual kind of event because it was normally the other way round.</p>

As I said earlier, it can be argued that if companies become global economic powers in their respective fields this is ultimately beneficial to the American economy.  That is ultimately what will inform the policy response in the United States.</p>

        <b>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</b>
        asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
            his views on the proposals for a new institution at United Nations level to deal with international monetary transfers and trade which would report through the Economic and Social Committee to the Secretary General of the UN.    
        [38564/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_244" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_667">The current global economic crisis presents us with major challenges which require a global response.  We are working with our EU partners to contribute to a comprehensive and genuine reform of the global financial system, on the principles of transparency, banking stability, integrity and improved economic governance.  In doing so, it is important to maintain a spirit of co-operation and openness.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">Following discussions with President Sarkozy, the European Commission President, José Manuel Barroso, and US President George Bush, a number of international meetings was agreed.  The US will host the first of these in Washington DC on 15 November, with the participation of the G20.  The EU will be represented by the Presidency and by President Barroso.  The European Central Bank will also be present.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">As part of the process, the workings of the existing global institutions, in particular, the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and the World Bank, will be examined.  Given the inevitable diversity of views, it is probably too early to take definitive positions on any issue at this time.  However, we will continue to work with our partners in the European Union to define a Common Position and to safeguard the leading role the EU has so far developed.  The French Presidency has convened a summit in Brussels this Friday with a view to developing a common EU position.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">On 20 October, the President of the United Nations General Assembly proposed the establishment of a task force to consider how the United Nations could contribute to addressing the global economic crisis.  The first meeting of this task force is scheduled to take place later in November, under the chairmanship of Professor Joseph Stiglitz.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_245">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_671">It is very interesting that the reference to the task force under Professor Stiglitz is at the end of the answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">Before I ask a supplementary question, and lest any other impression be created, I will say that many people around the world have welcomed the election of a US President who believes in multi-lateralism, the role of diplomacy and a greater commitment to the international institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">My question concerns a third institution that was originally drafted, voted on and agreed in 1946, at the same time as the World Bank and the IMF.  The reason I asked this question is that I do not believe that the Minister must make a choice and I put this to him.  If he accepts that the current financial problems are global in nature and predatory hedge funds and virtual financial instruments created havoc and destruction in the United States before spreading globally, he will agree the appropriate place to start is at the level of the United Nations.  The UN arrived at a similar point in 1946.  Is it the Government's intention to return to that point?</p>
            <p eId="para_674">On the meetings to which the Minister refers, the thinking of President Sarkozy is such as not to dislodge the disease that caused the current international currency crisis.  An approach generated through the G8 and G20 or even through the former informing the latter amounts to more of the same and does not deal with the virtual cancer caused by predatory funds dislodging investment from the real economy.  For these reasons, the appropriate position for the Government is to approach the issues through the United Nations and try to recover a moment rather similar to that of the Bretton Woods institutions.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_246" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_675">I am not entirely convinced by the Deputy's argument.  It is much to early to rush into a definitive position on the best international mechanism to deal with the present circumstances.  My understanding of the historical background of this issue is that the relationship between the International Monetary Fund and United Nations was governed by a broad framework agreement entered into in November 1947.  There has been a relationship between these two organisations in so far as the IMF and World Bank are specialised agencies in which the UN Secretary General is involved although they remain autonomous.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">While new mechanisms are clearly required, we must be careful not to have a knee-jerk response to the current problem.  In the first instance, we must analyse more deeply what has gone wrong.  It is only through such analysis that one develops an appropriate international regulatory response.  We must avoid duplication and overlap and, above all, ensure coherence in whatever emerges in what is potentially a new order in terms of the organisation and regulation of global financial systems.  This is an issue for debate.  Reverting to a position in which this matter comes entirely within the UN General Assembly, as the Deputy appears to propose, raises questions regarding the effectiveness of any such system.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_247">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_677">My appeal is not so much addressed to the General Assembly.  The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade emerged as an alternative to what had been agreed already, namely, the International Trade Organisation.  It had been envisaged that the new body would report to the Secretary General of the United Nations through the UN Economic and Social Commission.  I favour this mechanism on the basis that I am concerned, in the context of the international response, that the source of the fire sweeping through the international institutions is not being identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">I specifically referred to hedge funds which, by purchasing in a particular manner, can depress the price of shares before purchasing these same shares and, through mergers and acquisitions, destroy companies, jobs and so forth.  This is the forest fire which has swept across from the United States.  While the Minister need not agree with my analysis, the appropriate starting point for addressing the problem is the UN Economic and Social Commission.  The adjustments arising from the Sarkozy suggestions and made through the G8 effectively amount to more of the same.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_248" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_679">It is not a correct analysis of the Sarkozy position to state it does not amount to more than the making of adjustments.  The French President would not agree with that perspective.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_681">As I stated, these are still early days and I am not convinced by the Deputy's argument on what is the most effective international institution to address the issue.  Without doubt, the existing institutions require fundamental reform as they are outdated in terms of membership, composition and so forth.  The United Nations also requires significant reform to deal with modern global realities.  I hope the G20 summit commencing on 15 November will mark the beginning of a substantive reform of global financial systems.  The United Nations Secretary General will attend the meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">Human behaviour governs much of what is taking place.  While I may be facing into the prevailing wind on this issue, in my view we must analyse the problem, even if we believe we know what are all the issues.</p>

        <b>Deputy Billy Timmins</b>
        asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
            the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo; the steps Ireland can take to assist in the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.    
        [38568/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_253" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_686">The resurgence of fighting in the North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo is a matter of grave concern, both in terms of its implications for the humanitarian situation and for the stability of the wider Great Lakes region.  It has seriously undermined the Goma and Nairobi peace agreements and placed the progress made over the past year in the Great Lakes peace process in grave jeopardy.  The position, notwithstanding a fragile ceasefire, remains volatile.  I am particularly concerned by reports of widespread attacks on civilians by all sides in the conflict and the plight of the estimated 1.5 million people now displaced in the Democratic Republic of Congo, more than 1 million of whom are in North Kivu.  News of clashes yesterday is also disturbing.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">MONUC, the UN peacekeeping force which, at 17,000 strong, is the UN's largest peacekeeping operation, is mandated to use all means necessary to protect the civilian population.  Since 2001, three Irish Defence Forces officers have been deployed with the mission as military liaison officers.  MONUC is now seriously over-stretched and UN officials have called for extra troops and air assets.  The UN Security Council is fully seized of the matter and has been discussing appropriate responses as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has been heavily engaged in discussions in an effort to stabilise the situation.  Secretary General Ban's appointment of the former Nigerian President, Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, an experienced mediator in regional disputes, as his special envoy to broker a political settlement is a particularly welcome development.  The African Union, led by its current chairman, President Kikwete of Tanzania, has also been to the forefront of efforts to restore calm.  It is not as yet clear if there will be agreement to hold talks involving the Governments of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, as urged by the Secretary General.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to the Democratic Republic of Congo and has played a key role in supporting peace efforts to date.  Ireland fully supports the excellent work of the EU's special representative to the Great Lakes, Roeland van de Geer.  Last week, the EU Commissioner for Development, Louis Michel, visited Kinshasa and Kigali to urge the Presidents of both countries to find a diplomatic solution to the current crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">I also commend the efforts of my British and French counterparts, David Miliband and Bernard Kouchner, who have been engaged in vigorous diplomatic efforts over the past week, met with Presidents Kabila and Kagame during a visit to the Great Lakes last weekend and briefed colleagues in Marseilles on Monday.  At present, it does not appear there is likely to be an ESDP mission, with the focus instead being on support for the United Nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">Ireland is a significant humanitarian donor to the DRC.  Already in 2008, Ireland has committed more than €11 million in humanitarian aid funding and our support to the country since 2006 totals more than €31 million.  In response to the worsening crisis, the Government has allocated up to €1 million in extra funding for humanitarian relief in North Kivu.  In addition, Irish Aid has allocated more than €8 million in funding to Rwanda since 2006.  The European Union has announced an additional €4 million in humanitarian aid for North Kivu.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">The crisis in DRC will be high on the agenda when I meet with my EU colleagues at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 November.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_254">
            <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
            <p eId="para_693">The Fine Gael Party supports any humanitarian or other measures and assistance the European Union or Government can provide.  The Minister indicated that MONUC, which has 17,000 troops and costs €1 billion, is the largest UN peacekeeping operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">I listened to Deputy Michael D. Higgins comments on the failure of the current financial model and the role of the United Nations.  Does the Minister agree the current problems in the Democratic Republic of Congo are a classic example of the failure of United Nations peacekeeping?  MONUC is a strong, established peacekeeping force which has fallen into disrepute and lost the confidence of local people.  Approximately 1 million people have been displaced.  It is made up of a number of nationalities.  The force has been subjected to investigation.  For the first time, an internal disciplinary investigation unit was set up to deal, <i>inter alia</i>, with the sexual exploitation of the local population.  I implore the Minister to use his influence at the GAERC meeting to examine the concept of the EU providing peacekeeping support for the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  We can talk about the African Union using its influence and I notice the British and French diplomats stated, “You better stop the war, or else...”.  What is meant by “or else...”?  No one likes to see the use of force, but we must have a meaningful peacekeeping presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and regrettably, the force there at present does not supply it.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_255" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_695">The force was established in 1999 and there are 17,000 troops from the 20 different countries involved.  It is clearly the largest and most expensive UN peacekeeping mission, with a budget exceeding $1 billion, so this is no mean attempt to deal with the problems.  It is mandated to use all necessary means to protect civilians from physical attack.  It is clearly signalling to the international community that it is overstretched and it has had to reinforce its presence in North Kivu province, cutting back on vital troop presences in other provinces.  It fired on CNDP rebels last week in an attempt to halt their advance towards Goma.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">From an equipment viewpoint, logistics supports and so on, again there are clear indications it needs additional support.  With France holding the EU Presidency, the French Foreign Minister, Mr. Bernard Kouchner, articulated at Monday's meeting the key question in terms of the nature of the response and the obligation to protect citizens in particular situations such as this.  He also sent out a clear message that there will be accountability for unacceptable activities by governments as well as armed leaders and so forth, as regards horrendous attacks on civilians.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">We will work with both the EU and UN to support regional engagement.  The engagement of the regional leaders is the key to stabilisation and ultimately the resolution and the restoration of the Nairobi peace process.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_256">
            <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
            <p eId="para_698">I realise the EU does not have an infinite well of human resources.  However, will the Minister acknowledge that Pakistan, with 3,500 troops, cannot secure its own border; India, with 4,300 troops, is in a nuclear stand-off with Pakistan; South Africa, which faces difficulties with refugees coming in from Zimbabwe, is providing 1,000 troops?  The EU should have a role.  When it was established it had, as a primary goal, the promotion of peace, internally and externally.  There is an onus on the EU to supply the security contingent to assist the force that is there at present.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_257" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_699">That is a very reasonable proposition and it has neither been ruled in or out.  It will require the agreement of all the member states as regards participation, particularly in the context of the battle groups for rapid deployment under a UN mandate.  Again, no decision has been taken and it is probably an issue that will surface at the GAERC meeting.  We have an open mind with regard to EU engagement along the lines to which I have just referred.  Again, one has to be very careful.  There is a need to assess the situation to ensure that logistically and from a perspective of feasibility, it would add value to the situation.  The Deputy has made a legitimate point.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_701">Ireland, together with its EU partners, is committed to a negotiated and comprehensive settlement in the Middle East, with a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at its core.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">Ireland strongly supports the Annapolis process, launched under US auspices in November 2007, aimed at reaching agreement between Israel and the Palestinians by the end of this year.  While it is clear now that this deadline will not be met, it is understood that some progress has been made in the discussions, which have been led by out-going Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.  The priority now must be to ensure that this progress is carefully preserved for immediate resumption of talks once a new administration is in place in Washington, and after the upcoming elections in Israel.</p>
            <p eId="para_703">As Deputies will be aware, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni — who succeeded Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as leader of the Kadima Party on 17 September — has been unsuccessful in her efforts to construct a coalition and, on 26 October, she requested President Peres to dissolve the Knesset.  It now appears highly likely that a general election will take place early in the new year, perhaps around mid-February.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">The Government remains seriously concerned about the humanitarian and security situation in Gaza, which has effectively been isolated since the Hamas takeover in June 2007.  We have consistently called for an end to the isolation of the people of Gaza, in particular through the re-opening of crossing points for the movement of people and goods.  Despite a ceasefire between Israeli forces and Hamas, in place since 19 June 2008, Israel has continued to maintain the closure of all border crossings for the movement of people, with limited exceptions.  Rafah international crossing point, the only border crossing via a country other than Israel, also remains closed since June 2007, with very limited openings.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">The Government agrees with those who state that the effective isolation of Gaza constitutes collective punishment and is illegal under international humanitarian law.  While Israel argues that essential supplies are being allowed into Gaza, there is no doubt that the population of 1.5 million has been facing unsustainable conditions of daily life.  Ireland will continue to work with EU partners to ensure that our concerns about these matters are conveyed to the Israeli Government at every appropriate opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_706">I deeply regret yesterday's violent incidents which saw the deaths of six Palestinians and the firing by Hamas of numerous rockets.  I hope these will not derail the ceasefire, and I fully support the efforts being made by Egypt to have it extended beyond the official expiry date of 18 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">More generally, I welcome the improved security situation in the West Bank, and hope that it will result in the urgent lifting of restrictions on access and movement for ordinary Palestinians there, facilitating greater economic activity and growth.  However, the continued construction of Israeli settlements remains of serious concern.  We have called for decisive action by the Israeli Government to freeze all settlement construction and dismantle outposts, in line with their commitments under the roadmap for peace in the Middle East.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">I support and commend efforts being made by Egypt, on behalf of the Arab League, to advance reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.  Success in these discussions is greatly in the interests of the Palestinian people, and can only help to underpin efforts to secure a lasting peace.</p>

            <p eId="para_710">I welcome the Minister's reiteration of the principle of collective punishment, as per his description of what is taking place in Gaza.  To save time I shall put some quick questions.  If the Government recognises that what is taking place constitutes collective punishment, what measures are being taken to ensure compliance with the human rights conditionalities attached to the EU-Israel agreement?  Is it not the case that relationships have been deepened without any cognisance being taken of compliance or breach of compliance with the human rights conditionalities?</p>
            <p eId="para_711">With regard to the Minister's reference to the Rafah crossing point, is it not the case that the EU as part of its own negotiations in relation to facilitating the crossing, undertook certain procedures which are missing on the ground?  Effectively the Rafah crossing is closed.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">With regard to the Minister's reference to the takeover of Gaza by Hamas, is it not the case that the international community urged Palestinians to conduct elections, which led to the election of Hamas?  It was singularly unhelpful to have proscribed Hamas in advance.  Therefore, constructing proposals for peace in the West Bank or dealing with the situation generally and specifically with Abbas to the exclusion of Hamas is not likely to bring progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_713">I take the overall points made by the Deputy.  With regard to the EU-Israel agreement, Ireland was one of the strong advocates for a linkage between it and political developments and commitment to a two-state solution.  This was not entirely appreciated by the Israeli Government, as was articulated to me by Foreign Minister Livni, when I met her.  I was asked why Ireland was so strong among EU states in taking a position on this.  A number of other states joined us in that.  It is an ongoing issue in the EU.  Some member states, in essence, want to separate a policy of a strong trade and economic agreement with Israel from the political process and human rights issues within the Middle East.  We have a clear position on that, insisting that there has to be linkage.  Almost all the EU states regularly criticise the ongoing settlement within Palestine and so on, which in our view is compounding the difficulties of ultimately reaching a solution.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_714">In the context of the EU-Mediterranean agreement, why allow for a deepening of the relationship without any evidence of compliance on the human rights' side?  Why not, for example, stipulate a six-month period in order to monitor compliance and then, at the end of the six months, decide where we stand on the agreement?</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_262" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_715">I empathise with the Deputy's views, but we make our stance, and continue to do so, within EU meetings and that is where we articulate our position.  On the Hamas question, there cannot be an overall political settlement which does not include Gaza.  It is, therefore, logical that Hamas must be involved at some point.  However, the EU is not ready to negotiate with Hamas until it recognises Israel's legitimate right to exist and renounces the use of violence as a political tactic.  There are responsibilities on all sides.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">We believe the key enabler in this area is the Egyptian process of developing reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas.  We support the Egyptian initiative in this regard.  That initiative is an important prelude to any overall settlement.</p>

         asked the

            the practical difference the Accra agenda for action will have on Irish aid policies and day to day operations in Ireland’s development aid programme countries.    
        [38570/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_263" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_718">My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, Deputy Peter Power, led the Irish delegation to the Accra high level forum on aid effectiveness in Accra, Ghana in September and was able to make a meaningful contribution to the discussions on the Accra agenda for action.  The high level forum has been effective in drawing renewed attention to the importance of improving aid delivery and giving value for money, especially at a time of a world economic downturn.  As Ireland has been a strong advocate of the principles of aid effectiveness, agreed by both donors and developing countries in the Paris declaration of 2005, the Accra agenda for action will not make a significant difference to the way we currently work.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">The context for Accra was a stocktaking of progress on the targets and benchmarks for better delivery of aid agreed in the Paris declaration.  These include improved harmonisation of donor interventions; alignment with partner countries' policies; better division of labour among donors; improved transparency and predictability of funding; untying of aid; and mutual accountability for results.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">The Accra agenda for action highlights three areas where further progress needs to be made by both partner countries and donors.  These are strengthening country ownership over development, building more effective and inclusive partnerships and delivering and accounting for better results on the ground.  Ireland is recognised as having made significant progress in all these areas.  Our commitment to delivering our aid in ways that build capacity in partner countries, that support their national development policies, strategies and plans and that strengthen their national systems for delivery and accountability is explicit in the White Paper on Irish aid.  Our aid is 100% untied and our country programme documents provide indicative funding amounts to our partners for up to five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">The recent monitoring survey on the Paris declaration undertaken by the development assistance committee of the OECD in preparation for Accra indicated that we are performing above the EU average on most of the indicators agreed in the declaration.  We will continue to strengthen our performance over the coming years.</p>

            <p eId="para_722">This is an issue that arises again and again.  It arose again today when Concern attended the sub-committee on overseas development.  With regard to Accra, today's discussion was concerned with the harmonisation of donor activity and cutting down the duplication of bureaucracy.  Concern used the examples of Vietnam and Tanzania, where, for example, officials in the health care system spend more time on administration and dealing with donors than on the health care system.  The GNP of development countries is being reduced, just as ours is.  Therefore, we must have far more efficiency within the Irish aid budget as well as in budgets generally throughout the world.  What ongoing efforts does Irish Aid make to ensure there is more efficiency and no unnecessary duplication within our aid budget?</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_265" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_723">We are in tune with and support the Accra agenda.  The Deputy's point is well made.  For some time there was a lack of co-ordination between donor countries and we put too much stress on recipient countries in terms of their governmental capacity to absorb and spend aid.  Now, different countries and donors take a lead in respect of countries in certain areas, for example, in Uganda in terms of education.  Ireland has supported the Government of Uganda strongly on the education agenda, to such an extent that Uganda now provides education for an extra 5 million children who started school over the past decade as a result of the introduction of free primary education.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">In Uganda, Ireland has contributed to building better schools, training teachers, revising the curriculum, providing books, training school managers and so on. Our work there is a good illustration of how we dovetail with a national governmental agenda in terms of genuine sustainable reform and improvement of the existing governmental system <i>vis-à-vis </i>education.  This is the approach we are consistently endeavouring to pursue with governments.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_266">
            <from>Deputy John Deasy</from>
            <p eId="para_725">That is probably a good illustration.  I was in north-western Uganda with the sub-committee a few months ago, as was Deputy Michael Higgins.  We would probably agree the money is being well spent and distributed properly.  Recently, some members of the sub-committee went to Malawi, which is a very poor country.  As Malawi is a programme country, it is proper that we fund and give money to it, but how can the Minister be sure of where to focus aid?  Vietnam, for example, is a donor-laden country.  Should we not focus on the poorest of the poor countries, like Cambodia, as opposed to a country like Vietnam that is not in the same bracket as Malawi and Cambodia?</p>

We review the situation regularly and search for better value for money, better outcomes and optimal effectiveness in our aid programme.  I take on board the points made by the Deputy and will relate them to Irish Aid and the Minister of State.</p>

            his medium-term policy perspective with regard to supporting central and eastern European countries as they balance their priorities between Russia and the European Union.    
        [38398/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_270" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_730">Since 2004, considerable efforts have been made through the EU's European neighbourhood policy, ENP, to offer our neighbours to the east a privileged relationship.  This relationship is intended to build on a common commitment to democracy and human rights, the rule of law, good governance, market economy principles and sustainable development.  Progress has been made in these areas, although different countries progress at their own pace.  It is important to emphasise that the ENP remains distinct from EU membership.  The EU nonetheless has a strong interest in ensuring peaceful and democratic development in the region, and most of the countries there wish to have closer relations with the EU.  They have also had long relationships with Russia.  The EU recognises this and at the same time believes that the countries' foreign relations are primarily a matter for themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">For its part, Ireland contributes between €8 million and €9 million annually to projects and programmes aimed at poverty alleviation, good governance, democratisation and the reform process in a number of countries in the region.  I am greatly interested in developments in eastern Europe and the Caucasus and intend to visit the latter region later this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">The recent European Council decided that proposals for a future "eastern partnership" of the ENP should be submitted by the Commission in November.  This is likely to see a build-up of relations over the medium term, with further work being done in such areas as regulatory convergence, free trade agreements, enhanced people to people contacts, political co-operation and extended EU support for sectoral reforms in the countries covered.  Some of these points are covered in the new EU-Ukraine association agreement, currently under negotiation, which is likely to serve as a model for advancing relations with other eastern European countries.  This is the approach the EU will follow in the region in the period ahead.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_733">The Minister mentioned the criteria for the European neighbourhood policy, but does he agree it might be worth reviewing these, particularly the priority given, for example, to transitions to market economy?  Some of the former territories dominated by what was the Soviet Union and in the neighbourhood of Russia have seen disastrous abuses in the transition involved to the market economy from previously socialised assets.  Taking Ossetia as an example, how does he envisage the balance of autonomous regions being achieved by the European Union among regions which formerly fell within the Russian sphere of influence?  Ossetia, along with several other regions, enjoyed autonomous designation in Georgia under the USSR.  Am I correct that the EU's definition of sovereignty considers the outer boundary of a state and ignores such forms of autonomy as might have existed?  Perhaps the Minister will agree that recognising forms of autonomy is important not only along the borders of Russia but also in respect of Africa, Asia and, possibly, China-Tibet relations.</p>

            <p eId="para_736">The Deputy can describe these events however he likes but they did not give rise to a fully transparent market.  Much of the asset privatisation which took place following the fall of the Soviet empire was unacceptable.  The process gave rise to some difficult questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">Fundamentally, the EU's engagement with our eastern partners is informed by a genuine commitment to human rights, systems of governance and the development of democratic parliamentary systems.  That will continue to be the case as we seek to act as a force for good.  We must be mindful of history, however.  Recent events in Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia reveal the complexity inherent in ethnic minorities within geographical boundaries and suggest that, while boundaries are important, perhaps the critical issue is how minorities are treated by particular jurisdictions in terms of parity of esteem and genuine respect.  Failure to act appropriately in that regard will ultimately result in crises.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">I met recently with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Mr. Sergey Lavrov, who outlined one version of the historical narrative of South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Georgia, and I recognise the existence of alternative narratives.  It is clear from the map, however, that the situation in terms of ethnic minorities is complex.</p>

            <p eId="para_751">Certain issues arise in respect of Kosovo but, as I have argued previously, there are differences.  The exercise of self-determination does not normally allow for changes to frontiers outside of decolonisation but there are grounds to conclude that exemptions are permitted in the case of fundamental abuses of human rights such as the mass killings and ethnic cleansing in Kosovo during the 1990s.  From a practical perspective, the restoration of Serbian rule was unimaginable.  The comparison is, therefore, not direct, although the Russians have questioned the level of consistency on the part of the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_753">I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to the vital work being undertaken by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, in support of Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.  UNRWA provides basic services to more than 4.6 million Palestinians and operates essential programmes in areas such as education and health care, relief and social services, micro-finance and the improvement of infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">Palestinian refugees represent a particularly vulnerable and marginalised group and for this reason remain a central focus of Irish Aid's programme of assistance to Palestine.  In this regard, I am pleased to confirm that Ireland fully intends to honour the commitment we announced in January 2007 of providing over €11 million in support of UNRWA over the three year period between 2007 and 2009.  Funding at this level will enable Ireland to become a member of UNRWA's advisory commission, which is composed of major donors and the Governments of the refugee host countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">In 2007 and 2008, a total of €7.6 million was provided in core support to UNRWA, of which €2 million was earmarked for UNRWA activities in Lebanon.  It is intended that a further €3.8 million will be provided to UNRWA in 2009.  In addition to core support, a sum of €500,000 was provided to UNRWA in late 2007 to support the education sector in Gaza.  This was in recognition of the particularly difficult circumstances with which refugee children in Gaza are confronted on a daily basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">Our funding for UNRWA is a key element in Ireland's overall funding to the Palestinian people.  Our funding has increased significantly in recent years, from €4.4 million in 2005 to €7.5 million last year, representing an increase of 70%.  Thus far in 2008, €4.9 million has been allocated, and further disbursements are planned before the year's end.</p>

            <p eId="para_757">I commend the Minister on maintaining funding for UNRWA at €11.4 million.  Fine Gael would be supportive of preventing this figure from being reduced as a result of the contracting economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_759">Does the Minister agree that UNRWA's efforts among Palestinian refugees are required because of the ongoing unlawful aggression by the Israeli State against Palestinians?  Israel's expansionist policies continue today, with the result that ever larger numbers of Palestinians are becoming refugees.  Palestinians must pay the human cost of Israel's policies while we fork out financially for the good work being done by UNRWA.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">Does the Minister agree the plight of Palestinian refugees will not be resolved until Israel feels the consequences of the occupation?  Can the Minister clarify that the economic sanctions provided for in the EU-Mediterranean association agreements be implemented as a minium?  This is why these sanctions were included, for where human rights were being abused and the territorial integrity of countries was not being respected.</p>

            <p eId="para_761">Until there is a political settlement, the refugee problem will persist.  I have had discussions with negotiators on both sides.  There is acknowledgement that the refugee question is fundamental to any ultimate political resolution and the two state solution.  As long as we do not have political resolution, we will need to provide comprehensive support via UNWRA to Palestinian refugees across the Middle East.  It is correct to say that the settlement policy is compounding the peace process and is undermining moderate opinion within the Palestinian movement, which is seeking to devise a way forward in terms of creating systems of governance and rule of law.  There have been some successes in the West Bank, Jenin and elsewhere in terms of the performance of the Palestinian Authority.  Prime Minister Fayyad, in particular, has had a significant impact and this has been widely acknowledged.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">The perspective of the Union for the Mediterranean is to try to develop stronger and more regular dialogue between the protagonists and between Arab countries and Israel so that eventually a better atmosphere, conducive to resolution, will be created.  We have met the principals of both sides.</p>

            <p eId="para_763">A former Irish Army colleague of Deputy Timmins, John Ging, plays a crucial role in UNWRA.  While it is very important, ideally UNWRA should not be necessary if the Palestinian situation had been solved.  The Irishman who does such good work there says that he is facing continual blocks on the most essential medical aid, essential aid for child nutrition and plastic bags.  The Israeli authorities suggest that these commodities are being used by those involved in subversive activities.  Would the Minister agree that what is happening in Gaza, and the situation Mr. Ging and UNWRA are forced to work in, is little less than a siege?</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_291" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_764">I agree.  I have met with Mr. Ging and he has articulated those points to me.  The most basic supplies necessary for education are denied.  I raised those points with the Israeli Foreign Minister at the time, Ms Livni, who undertook to investigate this to ensure it would not happen.  Others in UNWRA made the point that ultimately the policy in Gaza is fuelling fundamentalism more than anything else.  From our experience of conflict on this island, we know there are ways and means of creating conditions that lead people to agreement and reconciliation.  It is my contention that the policies being pursued are counter-productive in terms of the security of the peoples of the region.</p>

        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
            if he will confirm that the overseas development aid budget as a percentage portion of GNP will not be subject to cutbacks in the lifetime of this Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_292" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_766">The programme for Government contains a commitment to the expansion of the overseas aid programme.  We have set a target of spending 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, on official development assistance, ODA, by 2012.  It is estimated that Ireland's spending on ODA for 2008 will reach 0.54% of GNP.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">In 2009, the total allocation for ODA amounts to €891 million.  The largest element of this funding — €754 million — falls under Vote 29, international co-operation, which is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs through Irish Aid.  A further estimated €137 million will be spent by other Departments and through Ireland's contribution to the EU development co-operation budget.  It is estimated that the allocation of €891 million in 2009 will represent 0.56% of GNP and is a clear indication of our commitment to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on official development assistance by 2012.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Deasy</from>
            <p eId="para_768">I will not dwell on this matter, which has been addressed two or three times already.  We support the Government in its commitment to 0.7% of GNP and the continuation of that with regard to the sum going to aid generally.  Concern appeared at the meeting of the sub-committee on overseas development today and had a wish list of three topics.  Top of the list was that other European countries were not signing up to the 0.7% target as Ireland has done.  In some cases, aid budgets around Europe are shrinking.  Concern asked that Ireland take a lead in the EU to maintain that target and ensure that there is no further reduction in the aid budget of member states.  That was the main priority.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_294" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_769">I share the concern of the sub-committee and Deputy Deasy.  We will push strongly for the maintenance of the commitment to 2015 in an EU context and to 2012 in our context.  Nonetheless, pressures are coming on and it is important to maintain momentum.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">In the context of the UN General Assembly, Prime Minister Brown took a significant initiative in terms of instigating a summit of the UN on the millennium development goals.  That was a useful opportunity to put pressure on countries to rededicate themselves to realise the objectives of those goals, which are not being realised at the speed they should be if we are to get to the ultimate timelines originally suggested.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_295">
            <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_771">The Eurobarometer report of less than two years ago showed that 80% of the citizens polled did not know what the world millennium development goals were, which is a cause of great concern.  The Commission's publication of three years ago examined what was aid and what was not.  In the Irish case, some of the money allocated ended up as aid but in the case of many member states money had been deflected to other heads.  It was not real aid.  It is not a matter of the proportion of GDP but also what was covered.  This is a matter of real concern.  I should be reluctant to mention countries but Italy, for example, would not bear a forensic examination of what was allocated in the name of aid but was not.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_296" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_772">I take the Deputy's point, which refers to what Deputy Deasy said.  I am sure Deputy Higgins agrees that there is a role for Ireland to probe the issue more at EU level.  We will certainly do so.</p>

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_773">I am glad that the percentage of GDP is heading in the right direction.  Is the Minister confident that the money set aside is spent effectively and efficiently in promoting awareness?  That is the budget that Irish Aid holds.  One of the criticisms levelled at aid organisations was that they spent too much on administration and self-promoting propaganda.  Most organisations have addressed that and most of the money from organisations goes to tackling the source.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">Last year, a sum of €250,000, which could have been spent on saving lives, rebuilding communities and addressing humanitarian issues, was spent on circulating the summary of the White Paper on Irish Aid.  Only recently, €40,000 was spent on the annual report of Irish Aid.  Very few people will read this and it could have been put on a website more cheaply, with the money going directly to the source for which it was intended.  Does the Minister agree with the point I am making?  In this era there should be more efficient and effective spending of the money directed towards Irish Aid.</p>

            <p eId="para_775">The budget for Irish Aid is substantial, at over €800 million.  One can argue a point in terms of an annual report or the White Paper, but we need to disseminate a message in this respect across the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_777">We are all birds of passage here.  What will sustain this country's ongoing and long-term commitment to Africa and to the poorest of the poor is the generation of sufficient awareness of what we are doing domestically to inform subsequent public policy to ensure our commitment in that respect remains at the core as one of our primary objectives.  I saw the annual report and I thought it was a good one compared to some other documents we get.  Its pictures told a thousand stories.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">One of the greatest things I have witnessed since I took up this position is the great awareness among young people of our commitment to Irish Aid.  I visited a school last week where 15 young boys are going to Ghana to meet with those in a partner school there.</p>

            <p eId="para_780">They will do it any way.  They are raising funds.  Many schools are engaged in the WorldWise programme, which is administered by Irish Aid.  That represents the future.  If we can inspire our young people in that manner, it will be money well spent, provided we do it well and effectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_783">Yes, in the sense of the world.  I am pessimistic about achieving them.  The summit that was convened in September was important to shake up and refocus people on attaining those goals.  I pay contribute to the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, in that respect.  He led well on that issue and continues to do so.  He is a good example of an international leader who brings a global perspective to the domestic agenda.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, did likewise in his capacity when Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Finance and also when he attended the summit and launched our own taskforce on hunger.  It had a significant launch and demonstrates a particular commitment we can make to the overall attainment of the millennium development goals.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_785">The relationship between Ireland and the United States is deep, close and enduring.  Successive presidents and their administrations, and Ireland's many friends on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle, have made an enormous contribution to bringing peace and economic prosperity to this island.  These efforts have been greatly assisted by the distinguished individuals who have served as the President's Special Envoy on Northern Ireland, including the current esteemed incumbent Paula Dobriansky.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">Following yesterday's election I congratulate President-elect Barack Obama on his victory.  I look forward to working with the new President and his Administration in the years ahead to underpin and deepen further the economic, cultural and social relations between the United States and Ireland.  President-elect Barack Obama and Senator John McCain have both underlined during the campaign their continuing commitment to maintaining and developing relations between our two countries. Likewise, I will continue to work closely with the bi-partisan Friends of Ireland in Congress, chaired by Congressman Richard Neal.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">This close co-operation is underpinned by the network of relations with members of Congress and their staff maintained by the embassy in Washington.  The ambassador and his colleagues attach the highest priority to their work in this area and, following yesterday's US elections, will be active in ensuring that Ireland's interests continue to be effectively advanced with the new Administration and Congress.  In this regard, the level of staffing in our missions in the United States and our honorary consul system is kept under ongoing review.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">Aware of the need to constantly update the relationship and recognising the changing circumstances on both sides of the Atlantic, our ambassador in Washington has been asked by the Taoiseach to lead a strategic review of Ireland-US relations and to report on this by the end of the year.  The review is intended to facilitate the further development of this important relationship and to explore how our already close ties might be further enhanced into the future.  Considerable work on the review has already taken place and our ambassador in Washington has invited organisations and individuals across the United States to contribute their views.</p>

I listened to the US Ambassador's interview on "Morning Ireland" this morning and he made an interesting comment.  He said what somebody said on a campaign trail and what he or she did on being elected were two different things.  I am not sure this will be the case with President-elect Obama.  There is a danger he might follow through on what said on the campaign trail.  That is a concept that is quite alien to the Fianna Fáil.</p>

            <p eId="para_792">America is facing a $400 or $500 billion deficit this year.  It has a choice between increasing personal taxation or pursing what President-elect Obama talked about, namely, ending tax breaks for US companies that invest and create jobs overseas.  I have nothing but regard for Ambassador Collins, as the Minister will be aware.  I worked with him many years ago on legislation in Washington.  However, I am not sure that we have the capabilities to prevent the passing of tax legislation that would injure our vital economic interests in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">The Minister, in his response to Deputy Timmins, mentioned the word "over-reaction".  There is no over-reaction here.  There is a stark realisation that we have become uncompetitive and anything that affects US companies doing business here will have a drastic impact on our economy.  I am glad the Minister said that there will be a strategic review by the ambassador.  That needs to happen.  We need to review our capability on Capitol Hill in particular and the way we lobby in Congress.</p>

            <p eId="para_794">I wish to make it clear that I take seriously the campaign platforms of both President-elect Obama and the defeated candidate Senator John McCain.  We have analysed them, we are mindful of them and will not ignore them.  There are up to 474 US companies in Ireland employing approximately 95,000 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">I do not wish to digress but there has been a significant assault on the public service generally in recent times.  We have 29 staff in the US.  If one considers the extent of American investment in Ireland and the number of Irish companies that wish to trade and engage with the US, that represents an extraordinary performance by those staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">The Deputy's question raises the issue of deployment and securing value for money.  We will work with our contacts on Capitol Hill.  If there are other ways of adding to that effort at parliamentary level or otherwise, we are open to suggestions.  We are keen to do all we can in that respect.  The changes that will be required will also involve legislative changes.  There would be an element of congress involved in this.  We have established contacts and we will continue to do that.  Ultimately, I argue that what will determine American's fundamental self-interest will be the key issue here.  It will be the making of intelligent arguments, which corporate America will make in terms of what is the best interest of America of US multinationals.  They need a presence in markets across the globe.  They also need to access the brains of the world in other locations and so on.  They need to see how that adds to their global profitability.</p>

            <p eId="para_801">The Minister has 1,500 or 1,600 staff in the Department of Foreign Affairs and he should reappraise how they are allocated.  In view of the connections and the volume of trade between the two countries, the staff in the US should be strengthened.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">I acknowledge this point is not directly related, but with the new regime we should push to deal with the difficulty of the undocumented Irish.  There is a window of opportunity to do that, particularly based on the percentage and breakdown of the vote for President-elect Obama.  He got a great number of votes from members of the Hispanic community.  Perhaps more compassion would be shown on this issue and we could benefit from that.</p>

            <p eId="para_803">On the economic side, IDA Ireland has significant bases in the US, but in relative terms, compared to some of our competitors it has nothing exorbitant in terms of numbers.  Enterprise Ireland has a team in the US, as has the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Tourism Ireland, Bord Bia, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  There is a broad spread of such personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">I am undertaking the review to which the Deputy alluded.  We are reviewing how our resources are spread with a view to getting better value from them, with a very strong economic dimension in focus in terms of the changing world, where we should be and how to best use our human resources in that regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_811">I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 119, 127, 143, 145 and 149 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">I have already set out the very difficult situation in the Gaza Strip in my earlier reply to a priority question.  The Government agrees with those who state that the effective isolation of Gaza constitutes collective punishment and is illegal under international humanitarian law.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">There is also a political dimension to the problems in Gaza and, in this regard, the Government strongly supports efforts being made by Egypt, on behalf of the Arab League, to work with all Palestinian factions to bring about reconciliation.  I understand that a meeting is to take place in Cairo on 9 November between the different factions.  Egypt is also making efforts to broker a deal which would secure the release by Hamas of the captured Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, in return for the release of prisoners by Israel.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">Positive developments in these efforts would no doubt significantly contribute to an end to all violence in and from the occupied territories and facilitate a lifting of restrictions on the movement of Palestinians, both in Gaza and in the West Bank.  The EU will give every possible support to the process.  It has already stated that it is ready to resume the border assistance mission at the Rafah crossing-point in the event of agreement between Israel, the Palestinians and Egypt.  In the meantime, I would urge Hamas to ensure the humane treatment of Gilad Shalit, and to permit access by the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The Government will continue to work with our partners to strengthen the political role of the European Union in the promotion of a negotiated two-state solution.  The agreement at the EU-Israel Association Council on 16 June to upgrade relations with Israel was placed firmly in this context.  Discussions with Israel on the precise elements of the upgrading are only just beginning and will continue in the months ahead.  They are likely to include intensified political and human rights discussions.  In particular, it is hoped to establish in the near future an EU-Israel sub-committee on human rights, which would complement the work of existing bodies such as the Association Council, the Association Committee and the EU-Israel Sub-Committee on Political Dialogue and Co-operation, in monitoring implementation of the EU-Israel Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">The Government believes that the peace process must remain at the heart of the European Union's relations with Israel and the Palestinians.  Ireland strongly hopes that the Interim Association Agreement between the EU and Palestine Liberation Organisation, which entered into force on 1 July 1997, can be implemented as soon as possible.  Its objective is to create a free-trade area between the European Union and the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and to establish a comprehensive framework for political, trade, economic and financial co-operation.  Together with our European Union partners, we have urged Israel to facilitate its implementation and to join a trilateral dialogue with the EU and the Palestinian Authority.  We would very much hope to see moves towards negotiation of a full association agreement as soon as conditions permit.  We already enjoy excellent bilateral relations with the Palestinian Authority and look forward to these developing in the period ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_817">I compliment Sir John Holmes on the very stark presentation he gave to the Security Council.  I believe we all support what he said.  In areas of conflict we often talk about confidence-building measures.  In the Middle East the only solution is the two-state solution, the return of the refugees, a return to the pre-1967 borders and the demolition of the settlements that have been created since March 2001.  That settlement must be pushed because there will never be peace until agreement is reached on those matters.  It is not possible to build up to it.  In this case we must start at the top and work back.</p>

            <p eId="para_818">Is it not the case that deepening the agreement and facilitating its extension without having insisted on a monitoring mechanism to report within a defined period of time on breaches of human rights conventions represented a capitulation to continuing Israeli aggression in Gaza?</p>

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_819">On 1 September the EU decided that meetings with Russia about a new partnership agreement would be postponed, which I welcome.  Should the same approach not be implemented if the Minister believes, as he has said, that there is collective punishment in Gaza at the moment?  The EU-Israel Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement should be suspended as a means of making progress and forcing Israel to respond.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_322" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_820">I have already made my points about Ireland having a strong position within the European Union in tying any trade agreement between Israel and the EU firmly in the political context and particularly linking it to the creation of a two-state solution and the peace settlement.  There have been talks under the Annapolis process between the leaders of the Palestinian Authority and the outgoing Israeli Prime Minister.  Those talks offered hope if one talked to both sides, although others in the region were far more sceptical about the outcome.  Nonetheless, there is a process in place and there is commitment on both sides to reaching agreement.  Where that remains the position there is merit in arguments advanced by other states that there is a need to continue the dialogue and create a framework that ultimately would be facilitative of the outcome we all desire and to which Deputy Timmins alluded in terms of a political settlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">Given the result of yesterday's US presidential election, one of the key issues for the European Union in its relationship with the US is to ensure the Middle East becomes an immediate and key priority of the new Administration.  There is always a danger that with other priorities it could get relegated and it might only become a priority in the second or third year of the presidency.  It is imperative that the Middle East becomes an immediate priority of the new Administration and that it is attended to.  With that type of commitment allied to a stronger EU engagement we could push the process to a position where it might be possible to get the settlement we all desire.</p>

However, once people are any distance at all from the exchange — sometimes even half a mile — the strength of the signal is such that they cannot get broadband.  Is it the Minister's intention that these people will simply never get it and, if so, what has he planned for them?  What are we to tell people in these areas nominally serviced by broadband but with no real option of getting it?; (5) Deputy Seymour Crawford — the urgent need to review the concerns raised by Protestant fee-paying schools in response to the announcements made by Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, following the 2009 budget; (6) Deputy Mary Upton — the closure of 60 beds at Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, Dublin 6w; (7) Deputy Fergus O'Dowd — the misdiagnosis of X-rays at hospitals in the north east; and (8) Deputy Arthur Morgan — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain to the House why women in the north east are being denied treatment for possible breast cancer diagnoses, which arise from GP referrals being placed in a pile on a desk in Beaumont Hospital cancer unit because no system is in place within the unit to arrange appointments for those women who have been referred to the unit.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_827">In page 11, to delete lines 21 and 22 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_828">"(4) It shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that a gift for the advancement of religion is of public benefit.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_829">(5) The Authority shall not make a determination that a gift for the advancement of religion is not of public benefit without the consent of the Attorney General.".</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I acknowledge that the automatic presumption of public benefit for religious gifts has been of concern for some Members throughout the debate on the Bill.  The current wording of the Bill maintains the legal <i>status quo</i> as it restates a similar provision in the Charities Act 1961.  However, there were some concerns that this provision might be abused by unscrupulous organisations that might present themselves to the new authority as being religious in nature while their real motivation might not be so respectable.  There was also debate in the House during the previous Stage on religious cults.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">On foot of legal advice and in consultation with other Departments, it has been decided to make the presumption of public benefit for religious organisations a rebuttable one.  This means that the charities regulatory authority will in any case where concerns might arise have the right to request further information and clarification when a body applies for registration on the basis of advancements of religion, or, in other words, carry out a public benefit test.  The legal advice to me was that it is not appropriate for the authority alone to make the determination that a religious organisation does not have a public benefit.  Therefore, the consent of a higher authority, the Attorney General, who has a constitutional role as protector of the public interest, should be required.  The further legal advice was that the decision made with the consent of the Attorney General should not be appealable to the charity appeals tribunal and the amendment reflects the legal advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">From discussions on previous amendments, Deputies will be aware that I am introducing a provision whereby any organisation that currently enjoys a charitable tax exemption will be regarded as registered for the purposes of the Bill.  Thus, this amendment will not affect existing legitimate religious charities, as it is not the Bill's purpose to impact negatively on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The Government amendment will enable the authority to pursue any concerns about a religious organisation, including those believed to be involved in the types of activity referred to in Deputy Wall's amendment No. 17.  While that amendment is well-intentioned, it is not necessary in light of the broader scope provided for the authority under the Government amendment.  I commend amendments Nos. 16 and 18 to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_326">
          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_834">In addressing amendment No. 17 to this issue, my colleague, Deputy Wall, was concerned about the original text on page 11, lines 23 and subsequent.  He was particularly concerned about the loose language used in determining whether a gift is of public benefit.  Subsection 3(5) states: "A charitable gift for the purpose of the advancement of religion shall have effect, and the terms upon which it is given shall be construed, in accordance with the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets of the religion concerned."  This is a serious matter and one of the fundamental issues I mentioned in my early comments on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Subsection 3(5) means that, if one can get inside the definition of a religion, it automatically follows that one can draw up ordinances.  I do not intend to waste time, but some of the bodies describing themselves as religions are oppressive, dangerous and in breach of human rights.  The suggestion that they would be able to define their own structures is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">It was to this matter that Deputy Wall addressed his amendment, the function of which was to include the provision "provided that for the purposes of this section, "religion" shall not include any organisation or cult which in the opinion of the Authority is primarily economic in nature or employs oppressive psychological manipulation of its adherents".  None of the Deputies in the Chamber or those listening to us on radio would have a difficulty in identifying a qualifying body.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">One must make a choice between the wording of Deputy Wall, on whose behalf I will move his amendment, and that of the Minister of State in amendments Nos. 16 and 18.  My difficulty lies with the proposed clause (4) in amendment No. 16, which states: "It shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that a gift for the advancement of religion is of public benefit."  However, we will still be left with the definitional question.  I appreciate that drafting in this regard is complex.  We all respect the importance of religion and autonomy in describing practice and inviting people to accept principles of transcendence is a fundamental right of religion and religious diversity.  I have no difficulty in this regard, but Deputy Wall has noted the fact that a body qualifying as a cult in terms of psychological manipulation and oppression can secure attachment of the economic assets and income of adherents and members.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The value of accepting amendment No. 17 over amendments Nos. 16 and 18 lies in the fact that the former clearly leaves the issue of religion intact while explicitly stating the exclusionary condition, which is important.  I cannot accept amendment No. 16.  I have made my case for amendment No. 17.  While I realise that amendments Nos. 16 and 18 were an attempt by the Minister of State to address the issue raised on Second and Committee Stages, I will press amendment No. 17.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_839">I agree with Deputy Higgins.  It has proven difficult for the Minister of State to draft wording to address this issue properly.  As Deputy Higgins stated, no one wants an organisation that supports a cult over human rights and uses charitable funding other than in the public interest to be a registered charity.  While the Minister of State and the Department have tried to draft wording to address this issue, I am concerned that their amendments will not solve the problem.  I support Deputy Higgins.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_840">I agree with my colleagues in that we are all trying to address the same issue.  While I will not dwell on it or the slight difference in opinions, I will make some specific points.  The wording to which Deputy Higgins referred is derived from the Charities Act.  The Government amendments are my efforts to deal with a specific problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">It is important to bear in mind that we must strike a balance between supporting current charities without making the legislation overly cumbersome.  Given that the majority of religious activities are charitable in nature, we must be careful not to place them under unnecessary burdens while protecting people from cults and so forth.  We have seen to this in the rebuttable presumption of public benefit.  It is open to the authority to challenge a religion on these grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The issue is of concern to this side of the House as much as it is to my colleagues on the opposite side.  Without going through the amendments' contents, the wording is a balance to ensure that life for existing religions is not made too difficult.  We will press the two amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1011">Deputies will be aware that securitisation is a flagship industry that raises Ireland's profile among the international financial services industries globally.  In recent years several major financial institutions have located in Ireland on the basis that Dublin is seen as an EU market leader in the securitisation area.  Since Committee Stage it has been brought to my Department's attention by the Department of Finance that the current draft of the Bill could be interpreted in such a way as to oblige the type of charitable trust that is central to the way in which securitisation operates in Ireland to register with the new charities regulatory authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">I understand a particular concern is that in such circumstances, a legal risk might be created with regard to these trusts and this risk could act as a very significant impediment to conventional securitisation activities.  I am advised that securitisation represents an important funding mechanism for the domestic banking sector.  If the effect of the Bill was to reduce the scope for using securitisation as a funding mechanism in Ireland, the domestic banks could find themselves at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis </i>their foreign competitors.  The ultimate result could be higher funding costs that are spread on to Irish customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">The danger to the existing business is particularly important as it could have detrimental effects, not just on the 1,000 or so persons employed directly in securitisation in Ireland, but in employment in other parts of the international financial services industry here, as well as the wider economy.  These effects would be higher costs for borrowing by businesses or persons taking out mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">It was not the intention of the Bill to capture such activities or place the Irish financial services industry at any disadvantage to its competitors overseas, which might have the potential to lead to job losses in this country.  Securitisation does not involve fund-raising from the public and the entities themselves are largely inactive for the duration of their existence.  Members will be aware that in the current uncertain financial environment in particular, it is essential that established funding mechanisms continue to be fully available to financial institutions and no legal uncertainty is created regarding their usage.  I accordingly propose this amendment.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_1016">Securitisation involves an institution, such as a bank, selling non-liquid pools of assets such as mortgages or loans so as to create space on its balance sheet for new loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">In a traditional securitisation transaction, an institution sells the assets to another company called a special purpose vehicle, SPV, which has been set up specifically to facilitate the transaction and which is legally independent from the originator.  The money received from the sale enables the originator to make fresh loans, buy new assets or whatever.  The funds to purchase the assets are raised by selling bonds or securities to investors such as pension funds, insurance companies etc.  The income stream from the mortgages and loans is used to pay interest on the bonds and eventually to redeem them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Securitisation allows financial institutions to raise finance at a rate generally cheaper than traditional borrowing.  It allows them to convert assets that generate long-term income into cash that could be used for further activity, such as the making of new loans.  It also can remove assets from the balance sheet, thus improving returns on debt or equity and reducing their capital requirements from a financial regulation perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">I understand that the use of charitable trusts in securitisation is based on commercial law considerations.  For the securitisation process to work, the SPV must be independent.  The directors of the SPV have a contract to perform a certain task, such as issue the bonds and pay money to the originator company, but the SPV cannot be a subsidiary or in any way affiliated to the originator company.  One way used by many financial institutions to achieve this is to make the SPV wholly-owned by a charitable trust, the stated aims of which are to do nothing other than to own the SPV and to distribute any profits that might arise to the charity.  The choice of charities to benefit from the trust is made by the SPV trustees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">Members will understand this is a complex financial mechanism that uses a charity base.  It was not the intention of the charities legislation to address this financial institution and while the issue arose inadvertently from the drafting of the legislation, the consequences to the financial services industry are quite significant.  I understand that approximately 1,000 direct jobs are affected by this.</p>

My Department has reflected on this matter in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  We are satisfied the existing penalties on summary conviction are adequate.  However, in the case of conviction on indictment, I propose to increase the maximum term of imprisonment from five years to ten years, which is broadly equivalent to the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  Although the ethos of the Bill remains a supportive one, it is important that it includes an adequate deterrent to discourage abuse of charities by unscrupulous individuals, particularly in respect of serious fraud, money laundering or terrorism.</p>

The Minister of State and I both know that no judge will want to send someone to jail for 12 months when it might be more effective to pay a fine.  I propose the fine amount should be increased from €5,000 to €10,000, as judges will not be inclined to send people to jail.  However, such individuals would be hurt in their pockets.  In the event of a serious offence, judges will implement the law well and will deal with those who must be dealt with.  I ask the Minister of State to consider this proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_1025">The Minister of State should indicate to Members what he would categorise as an offence that would merit either of these penalties.  Does this pertain to the concern that many organisations, which may be cloaking themselves as charities, only provide minimal amounts of the sums they collect to the actual charity involved?  Is this the type of offence that is envisaged?  I refer to cases in which perhaps 5% of the sums collected go towards a charity and in which sharp practice might be implied.  Is this the type of situation to which such offences will be applied?</p>

          <p eId="para_1026">One must realise the charities industry is very substantial.  As a nation, we give a great deal of money to charities, as does the State.  In particular, we are ensuring there is an appropriate penalty for serious fraud or embezzlement.  It does not simply pertain to issues such as the percentage given in or whatever but to how a charity might be structured or run fraudulently or corruptly.  This is the reason the more serious penalty is appropriate.  Moreover, it mirrors the fines and penalties as laid out in the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">Deputy Ring made an interesting point in respect of the summary penalties of a fine of €5,000, as well as up to 12 months imprisonment.  While I will not rule his proposal in or out, I will examine how it sits in comparison to similar items of legislation, as we did for the increased indictment penalty.  If I deem the figure to be inappropriate, I will take the opportunity to amend the provision in the Seanad.  However, I will examine it in the context of other legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1043">I tabled this amendment to avoid confusion.  Charities are in favour of the regulator and welcome regulation, which has been sought for many years.  People are pleased this Bill has at last been introduced.  The Minister previously stated the Bill will be reviewed within five years.  It is important to do so in case Members do not get the legislation right as this is the first time such legislation has been introduced in Ireland.  It has been welcomed by all charitable organisations throughout the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">As for the regulator, charities should be able to do their job.  They should be able to raise the necessary funding that they should not be obliged to raise, were the State doing its job.  The regulator's role is to regulate and ensure that everything is above board.  It must ensure that charities produce annual accounts at the end of the year and are doing what they are meant to do.  However, the regulator should not interfere with the administration and management of charities.  While I do not object to the regulator providing advice to them, it should not be telling them how to run their businesses on a day-to-day basis.  The charities should run their own affairs.  The regulator's job is to intervene if a problem arises in how a charity is being run or if the law is being broken.  It is not to interfere with them on a day-to-day basis, which is the reason I tabled this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1045">I accept the comments made by Deputy Ring that the regulator should not be dealing with the charities on a day by day basis.  However, at the outset, the charities expressed some concern that this process would be cumbersome.  Consequently, much of what is being done in respect of the establishment and enactment of this legislation is to facilitate charities.  There will be a bedding-in period and assistance will be offered to those charities in that context.  The list of general functions outlined in the Bill is comprehensive and appropriate.  I do not believe the acceptance of the amendment would improve the Bill.  In fact, it places too strong an emphasis on the enforcement role over the supportive role and leaves out certain key functions of the authority.  For those reasons, I do not propose to accept Deputy Ring's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The Government's amendment to section 13(1) is a technical amendment.  It is considered that the role of the authority in regard to the management of the property of charitable organisations is already adequately provided for under section 13(1)(<i>c</i>).</p>

          <p eId="para_1048">I appeal to the Minister to be wary of putting too many regulators in place.  People are concerned about the appointment of regulators with no powers and who are not answerable to the House.  That is the one thing that concerns me.  I had great difficulty convincing my party that we need another regulator because we are opposed to having too many regulators.  I urge the Minister even at this stage to use an existing regulator rather than appointing a new regulator for this purpose.  I would prefer if the Department took on the role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">If charities find themselves in difficulty, I urge the Minister to ensure the regulator does not overstep his or her role.  That is not the purpose of the regulator.  His or her purpose is to regulate charities and ensure they do the job they were set up to do.  I tabled the amendment because it is not the job of the regulator to try to run the business of charities on a day to day basis.  I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Minister will give me a commitment that the regulator's job is to regulate charities to ensure they collect money from honest, decent people and that the money goes to charity.  The regulator should not tell charities how to do their business and that is the concern charities have.</p>

I remind the Deputy that a five-year review of the legislation is built into it.  The emphasis of the legislation and the set up of the charities regulatory authority is intended to be easy for charities to use.  That is evident in the specific provisions we have made throughout the legislation.  We are not trying to be overly prescriptive.  We are conscious that many of the charities involve a small number of people and we do not want the regulation to be a burden on them that detracts from their primary purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_1064">I recently had a poignant example of what Deputy Wall intended in submitting the amendment on behalf of the Labour Party when the house of an elderly neighbour caught fire.  A local community response was instigated and a number or residents went around from door to door to collect money to replace cookers and beds affected by smoke damage and to find an alternative house for the neighbour to rent.  One could describe that as an act of neighbourliness or an act of charity.  Under the proposed legislation, it would be described as an act of charity because money was collected for a specific purpose within a specific period that arose from a moment of need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">If the amendment is not accepted, a situation could arise under the requirements of the charities legislation that would prevent those neighbours who took that positive step from acting in the way they did.  I worked in the voluntary sector for a number of years and I am aware that regulation sometimes inhibits organic, positive community actions.  The amendment tabled by Deputy Wall provides for localised flexibility that would allow communities to take positive action in their areas to help people out on a one-off basis.  I urge the Minister to support the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1066">I support the amendment.  People in this country are very decent and honourable and they look out for their neighbours.  I have seen that in my constituency when serious tragedies occurred in the past.  Collections were made when, for one reason or another, the State was unable to do the job it was required to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">I agree with the thrust of the amendment.  On Committee Stage we made a strong case and we were told that one-off collections would not be affected by the legislation.  I hope that will be the case.  That is important because one never knows when a problem will arise.  I accept there may be concerns that one-off situations may run on and that they should be regulated, but in almost all cases when people collect money in order to do a good deed for their neighbour such problems do not arise.  I am familiar with many such cases, for example, when a person had to go abroad for hospital treatment or, as Deputy Ciarán Lynch outlined, when someone's home burned down and he or she did not have house insurance and the State was not able to pick up the tab.  Something has to be done in those circumstances.  I support the Labour Party amendment.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_1068">I gave the amendment much consideration because a number of people raised the issue.  The potential impact of the legislation on collections in aid of local or international tragedies has already been discussed on Committee Stage.  The Bill does not change the current situation on spontaneous collections.  What has applied up to now in regard to such collections will continue to apply.  As it stands, spontaneous collections made within a workplace, an office or private club do not require a collection permit.  However, I suggest that public cash collections have the potential to give unscrupulous people licence to defraud the public.  People are entitled to know that their generous contribution to a spontaneous collection is properly accounted for, as is the case with a normal public collection that has a permit.  The key point is that after the enactment, when whatever is collected has been handed over to a charity, the public will be in a much better position than it is currently to verify that the contribution goes towards the charitable purpose intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">If accepted, the amendment would give rise to important questions such as how such a collection could be monitored and by whom and the very fact that a collection would be exempt and could be outside the remit of the Garda.  If a collection is not monitored, how can we be sure it does not generate more than €50,000 or know how much is raised?  In summary, the proposed amendment would overly complicate matters and as the Bill does not affect the current position in regard to such conditions, I do not propose to accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1096">While I accept the Deputy's point, I reiterate strongly that the emphasis of the Bill is not to make life difficult for charities but to facilitate them every step of the way.  This should be evident from the amendment we made this morning, if nothing else, which deemed existing charities registered with the Revenue Commissioners to be transferred automatically to the new authority.  One should not consider the requirement to provide additional information as awkward and a cause of trouble for charities.  Rather, it is better that the regulatory authority seek additional information and give a charity that might have been remiss in submitting documentation an opportunity to comply rather than reject its application.  The legislation is to facilitate such charities.  While the legislation is substantial, it is not in any way intended to make the work of the charities more complicated.</p>

          <p eId="para_1101">Government amendments Nos. 35, 39 and 40 are required for the removal of any doubt that only charitable organisations shall be entered onto the register of charities.  Under the existing wording of the Bill, a possible interpretation could be taken that, once an organisation applies in the correct manner, it could be registered irrespective of whether it was charitable or not.  These amendments remove any potential for non-charities to be entered onto the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">Amendment No. 35 clarifies that an organisation may only be entered onto the register when certain conditions have been satisfied.  Amendment No. 39 provides that the charity will only stand registered when the authority has performed its statutory functions under this subsection.  Amendment No. 40 provides explicitly that applications from non-charities must be refused.  It also requires the authority to notify applicants as to whether their application has been successful and of the right of appeal against a refusal to register by the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">Deputy Wall's amendment, No. 36, proposes to impose a set deadline on the authority making a determination to the charitable status of an organisation.  It is too restrictive.  The authority would be potentially subject to applications from across the EEA and beyond.  While the authority would be required to expedite its business in a professional manner, there may be valid reasons an application might not proceed within the two months, for example, where additional information is requested and must be obtained from a charity based outside the jurisdiction.  I expect most applications will be considered within a two-month period but the priority is that the authority be allowed adequate time to make the right decision and not be forced to make a premature one because of a statutory time limit.  Therefore, I cannot accept amendment No. 36.</p>

          <p eId="para_1105">I am concerned about the two month timeframe.  There must be rules and regulations and charities should not be permitted to approach politicians stating the regulator has not dealt with their applications and that it is seeking further information.  I feel strongly about this.  The regulator's job is to regulate and assist charities, not to be a hindrance to them or prevent them from doing their job.  I hope what the Minister of State proposes will work and that he will reassure me in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1141">These amendments were drawn up following discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Company Registrations Office.  I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, and officials from both bodies for their engagement in bringing this matter to a conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">I am very aware of the importance in the sector of minimising the potential of dual reporting requirements for companies to the new charities regulatory authority.  This legislation was consciously framed to avoid placing excessive, additional administrative burden on charities while ensuring that the new authority shall have adequate information to enable it to perform its statutory role.  These amendments will collectively minimise as far as possible the potential for incorporated charities having to file the same document with two separate regulatory bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">In framing these amendments we have deliberately avoided interfering with company law which is wider and more complex than this Bill.  However, the complexity of company law and the various exemptions that apply to certain categories of company means that it is theoretically possible that a very small number of incorporated charities may have to provide certain documentation to both bodies for a limited time.  If such a scenario should emerge it has been agreed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that any such anomalies would be fully addressed in the short term.  All companies are required to prepare accounts under company law although some companies do not have to file the accounts with the CRO.  An auditor's certificate is sometimes sufficient for certain categories of company.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">Under these amendments the Companies Registrations Office will forward the company law annual return and any accounts information attached thereto that it receives from incorporated charities to the new authority, thus removing any potential additional burden for such charities.  Any such charities that are exempt from attaching audited accounts to their annual return to the CRO will be required to attach these to their annual report to the authority, as will other non-incorporated charities.  The new authority will, as of necessity, be particularly interested in the charitable activities of registered organisations which is not a subject of statutory interest to the register of companies.  Therefore, all charities, irrespective of their legal structure, will be required to submit an annual report on their charitable activities to the new authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">I am committed to prior consultation on the nature of these annual reports.  I wish to be helpful and am hopeful that they can be structured in such a way as to ensure that small charities, in particular, are not over-burdened in this context.  I reiterate that we will have prior consultation on the preparation of those reports.</p>

          <p eId="para_1146">I welcome the Minister of State's last comments.  This issue was raised again on Committee Stage and we were very strong about it, particularly in the case of small charities.  The less paperwork there is, the easier it is for such charities to operate.  What we want is accountability and it is with that the Bill is concerned.  We do not need over-regulation but we must have accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">I am pleased that other Departments and the Minister of State are concerned about this and that these charities will not be required to register with two or three different agencies.  The smaller charities do not have the manpower or the resources to do so and the bigger charities do not want all that paperwork either.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">I take the Minister at his word.  It is important and I have heard him speak clearly on this today.  He said that paperwork will be at a minimum and that is what we want.  We had a long discussion on the matter on Committee Stage and we do not want to have over-regulation.  That is what is going on in this country and people are sick and tired of regulation.  There must be a certain amount of it but in this country we are over-regulated.  We want accountability.</p>

Obviously, there are different kinds of charitable organisations.  Some deal with millions of euro every year while others deal with tens and twenties of euro.  The requirement to furnish annual reports is an easy task for a charitable organisation that has a bureaucracy in place.  It is not so for voluntary organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">What is required here is a simple measurable means by which an organisation is virtually directed as to what information is needed when it furnishes its annual report.  I am sure the Minister of State will take this point on board.  In referring to an earlier amendment, the Minister of State said that it might be difficult for an organisation to go through the registration process because it does not facilitate enough information.  It would be wise if the Minister took on board that, when looking for annual reports, depending on the size of an organisation, there might be a presciptive direction given to organisations.  We look for articles of association, trading and simple bank accounts.</p>

          <p eId="para_1220">A serious issue must arise before a decision is taken to remove an organisation from the register.  I am concerned about the recommitted amendments.  While I am not a legal person, I hope they are in order and do not make it easy for the regulator or someone else to remove a charity from the register.  This must only be done where serious offences or breaches in the law have taken place.  Organisations should not be removed from the register on a technicality or because a Minister, Government or someone else does not like it.  I seek reassurance from the Minister of State in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1221">Charitable organisations should only be struck off the register for profound and identifiable reasons.  If a charity which is struck off has a board of directors, will some form of tracking be used to ensure the organisation does not submit a new application to be included in the register under a different name?  While I take on board Deputy Ring's concern to ensure organisations are not removed from the register on the basis of prejudice, if a rogue group operating on the pretext of being a charity is removed from the register, how will we ensure it is not included on the register again under a different guise?</p>

          <p eId="para_1222">On a general point, I reiterate that the purpose of the legislation is to support charities.  However, the Government also acknowledges that the legislation regulates an area that has not previously been regulated.  We have all referred to bogus and rogue operations which may or may not be charitable.  If the legislation is to be effective in this regard, it must include provisions to deal with such bodies.  Without dwelling on the issue in detail, removal from the register is not the only sanction available in the legislation.  If less important issues arise with regard to charities, section 67 makes intermediate sanctions available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">On a previous point about allowing the authority a longer period to access information, the purpose of virtually all the provisions of the legislation is to assist the authority in dealing with charities in an equitable and fair manner, as opposed to striking them out or making life difficult for them.  Nevertheless, the authority must have available to it the sanction of striking off a charity in the event that it is engaging in criminal activity or a criminal conviction is secured.  However, striking out charities will not be the norm and intermediate steps are available for other breaches.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1279">In page 32, to delete lines 47 to 50 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1280">"(2) A body (other than a registered charitable organisation) that, in any notice, advertisement, promotional literature or any other published material, describes itself or its activities in such terms as would cause members of the public to reasonably believe that it is a charitable organisation shall, subject to <i>subsection (6)</i>, be guilty of an offence.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">Section 42 makes it an offence for charitable organisations which are not registered to hold themselves out as a charity.  Concerns were raised on Committee Stage as to whether this section was adequate to address practices such as door to door collection of second-hand clothes and bric-a-brac which are a concern to many people.  The Department has received numerous complaints from members of the public concerning such collections, with which Deputies will be familiar.  While it will be within the remit of the regulatory authority to make members of the public aware of how to determine the veracity of organisations which may ostensibly appear to be charities, this power, by itself, was not sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">The current provisions state that referring to an organisation when it is not a charity is an offence.  In practice, however, such organisations are careful not to refer to themselves as charities.  Nevertheless, they may convey a false impression through the language used in their promotional literature.  Therefore, having consulted the Office of the Attorney General, I propose amendment No. 57 to make it an offence to cause members of the public to reasonably believe that an organisation is a charity, irrespective of the terminology used by the organisation in leaflets, etc.  This amendment strengthens the existing provision and greatly limits the scope for non-charitable organisations to suggest to members of the public that they are charitable in nature.  This will, in turn, help members of the public to distinguish between genuine charitable collections which are not profit-based and non-charitable collections and make informed decisions about which collections they choose to support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">Deputies Wall and Ring have suggested alternative approaches in amendments Nos. 58 to 60, inclusive.  However, the formula I have developed in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General addresses this issue more satisfactorily.  Accordingly, I propose amendment No. 57.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_411">
          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1284">I am pleased the Minister of State has gone a long way on the issue of clothing collections.  RTE will this week broadcast a programme on these types of collection.  It is a scandal that people, in their generosity, place clothes outside their homes in the belief that they will be collected by a charity whereas the recipients, businesses in eastern Europe, are making millions of euro from the practice.  I am pleased the amendment will make it an offence for organisations which are not deemed to be charities to give an impression that they are charities in material delivered to homes.  I hope this law will be enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">I have never encountered such annoyance and aggravation as I have on this issue.  People have washed and cleaned clothes in the belief that they were destined to a charity only to find they are destined for thugs and criminals who are making a great deal of money out of what is big business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">I am disappointed the Minister of State did not deal specifically with mass cards.  When people buy mass cards signed by a priest in shops or from individuals, they do so believing they are supporting the church.  Instead, it is not clear where the money goes.  The religious orders have found that in many cases the signatures on mass cards purport to be those of priests who are dead.  This practice is wrong and needs to be stopped.  The Minister of State or his officials will probably argue the matter is one for the church.  They have informed me, for example, that it is difficult to deal with the issue in legislation.  It should be addressed because it is wrong that people are paying good money in the belief that they are supporting a charity or the church when, in some cases, we do not know where the money is going.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">I hope the Minister of State will discuss this issue with the Attorney General before resubmitting these amendments to the Seanad.  Perhaps it will be possible to draft legislation with the assistance and support of the church, which is also annoyed about the practice.  When people pay for a mass card, they hope a mass will be said.  In some cases, we do not know who signed the card, whether the priest named on it is alive or whether the mass will ever be said.  People are generous and decent and want to support the church and charities but this issue annoys them.  I am disappointed the Minister of State was unable to address the issue.  However, I support the amendment on clothes which I hope will deal with the cowboys, of whom we have many.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_412">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1288">I shall respond to the two amendments as well and begin by welcoming the Minister's amendment which is long overdue.  There are two types of robbery for which people are committed.  One gets robbed blindly, unknown to oneself, and one is robbed in the course of doing something only to discover one is doing something else one never intended.  In the latter situation, there is a particular violation where people believe they are being charitable and find they are being conned.  It is quite upsetting because essentially it is a robbery of a person's goodwill, quite apart from the possession he or she will have lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">Ireland's reputation for giving is one of the things of which we can be very proud.  In the midst of the last great depression experienced in this country in 1985 when the Live Aid concerts took place, Ireland was the highest <i>per capita</i> donor to that programme.  I was living abroad at the time, like many of my generation all over the world in different countries, watching the Live Aid concerts.  It made us feel very proud how much money Ireland had given to the Live Aid project.  This is something that is innate in us.  Even as we enter another depression, we can be sure that level of charity and goodwill will continue.  I welcome specifically both the intent and outcome of the Minister’s amendment to this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">As regards Deputy Ring's amendment, that is a unique Irish action, the granting and usage of mass cards.  Ironically, it is something the Catholic Church regulates quite extensively.  One cannot get a card signed in every church and not every priest can sign a card.  I believe papal permission must be granted before a priest may engage in this and only certain religious orders have it.  The Catholic Church has been very mindful of the whole practice of having mass cards signed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">It has been reported that "signed" mass cards are now available in petrol stations.  One can get €20 of petrol and a signed mass card going out the door.  Surely that is something the Minister should be looking at.  I question the practice of buying mass cards in such a fashion, because in the event, people are knowingly complying with a very deceptive practice.  There is a particular context in which mass cards operate, as a charity, however, because much of the money collected goes to India and other overseas missions.  It is for particular religious orders which provide a strong charitable service in the local communities and missions abroad.  Obviously, Deputy Ring's amendment will not be passed, but I ask the Minister of State to give this further consideration when it moves onto the next stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanBarrett" eId="spk_413">
          <from>Deputy Seán Barrett</from>
          <p eId="para_1292">I support the Minister's amendment in relation to these activities involving the collection of clothes etc.  We are very fortunate to have people in our community who give their time voluntarily working in cancer support shops and other places without reward and who collect clothes from households and so on.  Anybody who is doing things that damage such charities needs to be put off the road — and I mean put off the road.  I hope the penalties involved in this will be sufficient to make certain that it becomes less attractive for people to break the law as a result of the passing of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">We have spent a great deal of money over the years trying to deal with the Traveller problem, getting children off the street.  In the middle of winter in the 1970s and 1980s one saw unfortunate little children sitting beside their mothers on the street.  We spent a fortune and got to the stage where that does not happen in that community, by and large, any more.  However, it has been replaced, unfortunately, by some ethnic groups which are involved in these scams.  What annoys me most is that in some instances, not alone do they have children delivering notices about a collection the following Friday, but they have their unfortunate wives sitting on cold streets with babies collecting money without any sign or light of the male members of the family.  These women are dropped at different locations early in the morning and picked up in the afternoon.  The same people are involved in these scams and I am very pleased the Minister is at long last doing something about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">It should be a message that this society, through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, deals with people who do not qualify for benefits, where there is a need to support children and feed them.  That system is still in place despite our difficulties and that is why the health authorities, through the HSE, have officers to help people in need of assistance.  One sees young children being used to deliver these leaflets and their younger siblings sitting beside the mothers in the middle of winter, freezing cold, and not a sign of the fathers in all of this.  They are the people organising the scams in particular, so I am very pleased to see this amendment.  It will do so much to encourage more volunteers into these genuine charitable shops such as those of the Irish Cancer Society, Oxfam, UNICEF and many others.  We are only too pleased to support these organisations which do tremendous work on a voluntary basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">I am very sorry the Minister of State has not supported my colleague, Deputy Ring's amendment.  This is another situation that needs to be sorted out and here is an opportunity to do this.  We will not get an item of legislation again that can deal with this issue.  The fact that Deputy Ring tabled the amendment — I have been lobbied as well — shows there is great concern in the community about this issue.  It is not going to cost anybody any money.  This is only going to ensure that genuine people who pay their money to have masses said whether for an anniversary, the death of a close relative, a friend or whatever are guaranteed the money they pass over will ensure the masses are said.  This reflects the Roman Catholic community.  I appreciate that is the only community which is involved in this, but it is important.  I am a member of the Roman Catholic community and like to see a mass card being handed to a relative in an hour of need.  It is great comfort to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">To think that people have got to the stage of selling these in shops and garages and handing them out with €15 of petrol is horrifying.  It is totally disrespectful to the whole concept of a mass being said for a deceased person.  I suggest to the Minister of State that there is an easier way to solve this problem.  One should not be allowed to purchase a mass card from anybody other than a priest who would sign it in ink, or from a church or an office attached it.  If I go into Clarendon Street church, for example, there is an office there and I know that if I purchase a mass card the community there will say the mass.  This is equally true of the Holy Ghost fathers, for example.  An amendment can be framed which will solve this problem.  It will not make it inconvenient for people to purchase a mass card.  It is not too difficult to either go to a church where there is an office or else the mass card should be signed in ink by a priest.  If it is stamped in an office attached to a church, that is for convenience, but one knows the mass will be said.  God help us all, however, if we go as far as the selling of mass cards as a commercial operation.  I appeal to the Minister of State, even at this late stage, if he has to go back to the Seanad with the legislation, to consider drafting an amendment such as the one put forward by Deputy Ring.  I have put forward my ideas, which I believe are workable.  We should deal with the issue once and for all now that we have the opportunity through this legislation.  It would be a shame to lose this opportunity.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" eId="spk_414" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_1297">I thank the Members opposite for their comments.  Deputy Lynch mentioned this long-awaited amendment.  Amendment No. 57 was a long-awaited amendment because it was difficult to deal with the issue and there was much discussion, backwards and forwards, with regard to how to police something that is unregulated.  I acknowledge there was a long wait.  We consulted extensively on the matter and got much legal advice.  It did not prove easy to come up with this formula.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">The issue of bogus collections is something that exercised Members both here and on Committee Stage.  The issue is that those doing these collections are not charities and are not saying they are charities and they would not, therefore, fall under the remit of the legislation.  The approach we took is that they need not say they are a charity, but if they give the impression they are a charity through their literature and the style of what they are doing, they can be found guilty of an offence.  This approach allows this amendment and I am glad it is being accepted on all sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">With regard to the issue of mass cards, it did not prove possible, having regard to the legal advice to the Department, to include specific provisions with regard to the sale of mass cards in shops.  If the Deputy wants me to have another look at the issue and to refer it again to the legal expertise in advance of taking it to the Seanad, I will do that.  However, I have been given legal advice on the issue and do not expect significant change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">I wish to make a further point.  We need to make a distinction between selling mass cards and what is happening on the other side.  The sale of the card is a normal transaction, but if it gives the impression that it is for a charitable cause, it may fall under the same part of the legislation as door to door collection.  Therefore, if the mass card sale is designed in such a way that the funds being paid go to a charity, it may also fall under the same provisions as for door to door collections.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">In terms of the Deputy's specific request, I will not promise we will make a change, because we have had extensive consultation.  However, I will ask the legal people to have a look at it one more time before it goes to the Seanad.  I will do that for the sake of completeness and bearing in mind the contributions made here.  I assure the House, if it was an easy thing to do and if we had found an appropriate form of words that would satisfy all legal advice, the provision would be included.  I am as anxious as anybody else the issue should be addressed, but unfortunately, it was not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">Deputy Ring asked whether we had been in contact with the church.  The Department has been in contact with the church on the issue.  It is doing a public awareness campaign, led by Bishop Colm O'Reilly, encouraging the public not to support the buying of mass cards in petrol stations and whatever.  Unfortunately, we cannot accept the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_415">
          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1303">I welcome the promise that the Minister of State will return to the Attorney General to see if there is any way to cover the issue.  Deputy Barrett covered the issue well and got to the nub of the matter.  The church has a role to play.  We need to take the Del Boys out of the sale of mass cards.  I agree with the Minister.  We are not complaining about the shops, but about people paying for a mass that is not being said.  The church has a role to play and it must be stronger about saying to congregations that they should only buy cards that are signed by priests they know.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">Deputy Barrett got to the nub of the matter.  Mass cards should only be signed on the day people pay for it and should be signed by a priest they know.  We should stop the Del Boy situation where people sell signed mass cards to shops that then sell them on to customers and nobody knows whether the masses are ever said.  That is an abuse of the church.  I am glad the Department was in contact with the bishops and am delighted Bishop O'Reilly and the church will come out strongly on this.  It is not right that people pay money under false pretences.  The situation is similar to that with the collection of clothes.  I am glad the Minister of State intends to get further advice on the issue.  I welcome that and hope he brings forward the necessary amendment to deal with this when he brings the legislation to the Seanad.</p>

Concerns have been raised on Committee Stage that future changes in auditing levels would have to be done by way of amendment to the legislation.

          <p eId="para_1430">I am pleased to move this amendment, which will permit trustees and persons personally connected with trustees to receive remuneration in respect of non-trustee services provided to a charity.  At present, charity trustees are not permitted to receive any remuneration from the charity.  Given the voluntary nature of charitable activities, the principle of trustees not being paid for trustee-related services should be retained to ensure public confidence in charities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">I can see merit in trustees being remunerated for non-trustee services subject to adequate controls being put in place.  It can be difficult for charities to source particular expertise due to limited resources or an inability to meet commercial rates that apply to certain professions.  Many trustees may have particular skills that they would be prepared to provide to the charity, perhaps for a fee below the market rate, were this to be permissible in law.  In this way, a trustee could provide professional or other services unrelated to the trustee role to the charity.  In single trustee trusts, an additional control is that the approval of the authority would be required in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">The amendment provides that, having due regard to guidance from the charities regulatory authority, with the consent of the board of the trustees, once it is in the best interests of the trust, a charity would be empowered to pay remuneration to a person who is either a trustee of the charity or is personally connected with the trustee.  Under this amendment, remuneration shall not be paid for trustee services.</p>

To be fair to professional people, they have been very generous with their time and office staff.  I see it with charities in my county, some people never charge for work when it is for charity.  Many people will not charge for this work but there may be complicated work they must do, which may take up time and the time of staff, and it is only right that such payment is not against the law.

It is not that trustees should be paid for trustee service work, it is for other activities and, in the main, the charities are the beneficiaries because they receive a service at a reduced rate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1439">Charity trustees are potentially personally liable for any losses accruing to the charity as a consequence of the performance of their duties.  This leaves voluntary charitable trustees exposed to an unreasonable personal risk.  I am conscious of the difficulties that charities can have in attracting trustees and I imagine that a situation where a trustee is personally liable for losses incurred by a charity as a consequence of a genuine error does not serve to encourage people to take on the role of trustee.  I wish to remove that obstacle and thus I move this amendment, which will allow charitable trustees, with the agreement of the charity, to arrange for the purchase of indemnity assurance out of the charity funds where they are satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the charity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1440">The provisions relating to the purchase of indemnity assurance contain safeguards to prevent abuse of power.  The trustee must always act in good faith and in the best interests of the charity.  This amendment will be broadly welcomed by charities and trustees.

          <p eId="para_1453">The Bill brings non-cash collections within the scope of the collection permit system for the first time.  Until now, the system had only applied to cash collections given that the legislation was introduced in 1962.  When combined with a number of other changes to the permit regime proposed here, this amendment will provide fairer access to the permit system irrespective of the method of fund-raising involved.  The wording proposed to be relieved left the chief superintendent with no option other than to refuse an application for a non-cash collection on a date or location where notification about another non-cash collection had already been received.  This was considered unreasonable as there might be no practical reason why both collections could not be accommodated within the district.  In the context of the other Government amendments being brought forward, a more flexible approach to the issuing of permits will emerge.</p>

          <p eId="para_1454">The Minister is saying that people will need permits in order to collect.  This is the most important aspect of the Bill.  People want to know that a collector, whether cash or non-cash, has a permit.  If gardaí approach someone who does not have a permit, he or she must be taken off the streets straight away.  If a collector is stopped by someone who asks to see the permit, the collector should not be allowed to collect cash or non-cash without a permit.  I welcome that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1468">The intent of this amendment relates to an earlier amendment in the name of Deputy Wall on which I spoke.  We need a traceability mechanism to deal with rogue practice in any organisation.  Such practice is not prevalent to any great extent in the charity sector but there is concern about it in some areas.  We see it used every day of the week.  Walking down a main street, one is almost doorstepped by a cash collector.  It is not a case of being asked if one would like to donate; one cannot walk from one end of Patrick Street in Cork to the other or down O'Connell Street in Dublin without being hit upon by a number of such collectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1469">The intent of Deputy Wall's amendment is not only to ensure the regulation of the permits granted but to encourage a code of practice to ensure appropriate collection methods and address what could be construed as strong doorstepping and presentational skills in the collection of money for charities on the street.</p>

          <p eId="para_1470">I agree with Deputy Ciarán Lynch.  He is correct in what he said.  I have said many times in this debate that Irish people are generous.  One aspect that upsets me and also elderly people is the abuse by some people who collect money on behalf of charities or for some other purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1471">Something must be done to stop these people.  One cannot go shopping on a Saturday or walk down a main street without people trying to give one something and exerting pressure on one to donate money.  There are very good charities such as those in the social services sector, St. Vincent de Paul and other such charities that have an annual collection.  They organise a collection on a Sunday morning and their members collect outside the churches.  People have a choice.  If they want to go into mass and if they want to subscribe, they can, and if they do not, they can walk away.  However, certain people collecting for charities on the streets are not very respectful of elderly people.  They put pressure on them to try to make them subscribe to their charity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1472">I am glad that at last this legislation will deal with this issue.  I will speak on this point at the end of this debate.  Many people are collecting for charities, but the charity for which they collect is themselves.  No charity ever sees some of the money they collect.  The people concerned will soon be frightened about making such collections.  If this legislation is passed through this House and the Seanad, it would be money well spent if the Department advertised its enactment to bring it to the attention of the general public.  Advertisements should be placed in local newspapers advising people that it has been passed by the Oireachtas, what it is about and urging them to ask individuals collecting for charities if they are registered, have a permit and for whom they are collecting.  It would be a worthwhile exercise.</p>

Those who sell a product such as a daffodil on Daffodil Day must have a sealed collection box and the collectors may have to give people back change.  This requirement causes a difficulty in this instance for those collecting for the Irish Cancer Society.</p>

It is an impractical requirement for some charities, particularly the Irish Cancer Society.  Daffodil Day is one of the great days of the year when people from all walks of life support that charity.  If the collection boxes are sealed, the collectors will not be able to give people change.

If the Minister of State were to reconsider the matter at a later stage in the Seanad, I would be quite happy to withdraw the amendment.  However, I know it is a frequently occurring practice.  Before the next Stage the Minister of State should ask the Garda whether it has been brought to its attention that permits that have been granted might not be fully availed of.

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1537">86.—(1) It is an offence for a charity to conduct public fundraising without holding a valid permit.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1538">(2) The form and operation of the permit system shall be determined by the consultative panel provided for in <i>section 34 (1)</i>.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1539">This amendment relates to people known as "chuggers".  I am not very happy with these people who force elderly people and others to sign up to things without knowing what they are signing up to.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to get the permit system in place.  The behaviour of these "chuggers" or charity muggers is not acceptable.  Earlier this year I was on holidays in a town in the south and I saw them in action.  The way elderly people are being pulled and dragged is just not right.  Until the money goes out of their accounts they do not realise what they have signed up for.  This is not a good way for charities to do business.  It is wrong because they target the most vulnerable in society.  They target people who are unable to say "no" and who want to support a charity but when they sign up to this non-cash scheme they do not realise what they have signed up to.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540">I want these people to be regulated and required to have a permit that they can produce on the streets.  I wish we could abandon this kind of collection altogether, but that is probably not possible.  I want to see these charity muggers controlled and regulated.  I want stronger regulation on how they operate.  Deputy Lynch and I spoke earlier about charity collectors putting boxes up to people's noses.  If somebody puts €5 into a box and it does not go to a charity it is not too bad.  However, if a person signs up to something for 12 months it is different.  In some cases people do not understand how standing orders work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1541">I will give an example of a similar issue that has nothing to do with charity and on which I hope legislation will be introduced.  I refer to mobile phone companies and I call them robbers.  The mobile phone companies are stealing money out of all our pockets.  I refer to messages that arrive and if one opens the message one must pay €2.50.  The mobile phone companies will claim they are only in a deal with another organisation.  However, it is the mobile phone company that is taking the money from people's accounts.  It is the same situation here and I want the Minister of State to address it.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_1542">It is already an offence under section 3 of the Street and House To House Collections Act 1962 to collect without a valid permit.  Therefore the first part of amendment No. 98 is not necessary.  I cannot accept an amendment to provide that the form and operation of the permit system shall be determined by a consultative panel.  The permit system is determined by primary legislation in the Street and House To House Collections Act 1962 as amended by this Bill.  It would be inappropriate for a consultative panel to be given such a role when the system is already set out in statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1543">I cannot accept amendment No. 99 in the name of Deputy Wall.  Section 86 provides a reserve power for the Minister to regulate the manner and conduct of fundraising.  My Department has worked in close partnership with the sector in the past two years to develop non-statutory codes of good practice for charitable fundraising.  The principles for these codes of good practice were published this year and discussions are taking place with the sector on the implementation and monitoring of the codes.  It is intended that the reserve powers in section 86 for the Minister to introduce statutory regulation would only be invoked if the non-statutory codes of practice prove ineffective.  It would be totally counterproductive to the process to force the Minister to introduce statutory codes of practice which would be the effect of amendment No. 99.  Therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1544">My amendment represents the way forward.  If the superintendent or the Garda or a panel were there and an existing charity had a collection on a day, a second charity would need to apply to the superintendent for its permit.  He would make the decision whether these two charities should work on the one day.  I hope something can be done.  For me this is the one issue relating to charity that is creating a problem.  If someone puts €5 into a box and it does not go to a charity that is not too bad even though people are defrauded of their €5 and might feel bad about it.  However, it is not right for an elderly person, for instance, to be tied into a contract by these people.  We need to tighten up on these charity muggers and how they operate.  I am opposed to them.  Other people will disagree with me, but I do not mind.  When charities sell tickets, we all know what is happening, but I am not happy about this way of doing things.  If I had my way and was Minister I would introduce the necessary legislation to ensure charity muggers would not operate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1545">I do not disagree with the points the Deputy has made.  When we go through the various amendments and have discussed them we also need to be conscious of the effect it will have on genuine charities.  One of the things the Deputy has stressed all along was that we should not over-regulate. We want a balance.  We have been in discussions with the sector to establish a non-statutory code of good practice, but this requires the buy-in of the entire sector.  The legislation provides reserve powers to the Minister if the code does not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1546">We are working in partnership with the charities without being overly prescriptive or creating too many difficulties.  While the preferred option is a voluntary code of good practice, I assure the House that the Minister will have reserved powers if the code does not prove effective.</p>

          <p eId="para_1560">In discussions with my legal advisers, it was recognised that the new authority will have a considerable and varied workload, including the functions of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, as well as having a broad regulatory role in the sector.  A wide range of professional expertise will be required from members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1561">While there is provision for the authority to delegate certain functions to committees, it would be of practical assistance to the authority to increase the maximum membership, allowing for greater potential for delegation of functions to committees.  The intention of Deputy Wall's amendment No. 102 is to ensure the involvement of grass roots charity workers in the sector's regulation.  However, I do not wish to be too specific about the status of the person from the sector, thereby allowing for flexibility in selecting the most suitable candidate.  For example, a former charity employee might have relevant experience and opinions.  There is also the danger that one representative of the charities might become not just the minimum requirement, but also the maximum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1562">It is intended that the authority will have a broad range of skills and expertise necessary to carry out its full range of functions.  The provision in the Bill for the appointment of members with knowledge of the management of charitable organisations is sufficient.  Therefore, I will not accept amendment No. 102.</p>

          <p eId="para_1563">It is important that charities be represented on the authority.  We do not want it filled with political appointees only interested in drawing expenses.  The legislation is new, but people have been crying out for regulation for years.  We want people interested and involved in the sector.  We also want people from outside the sector to give the authority necessary advice.  For too long, authorities have been filled with Ministers' supporters and friends, people with nothing to offer to a committee.  I call on the Minister of State to place people of good standing in the authority, who can support the legislation and charities and who will be able to make genuine contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1564">While the legislation will be reviewed in five years, I ask that the Minister of State address any unforeseen problems quickly, even if it involves introducing another Bill.  This legislation has not been tested, but it is necessary and has been welcomed by charities.  I hope that those who work with and understand the problems experienced by charities will be fairly represented on the board.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranLynch" eId="spk_504">
          <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1565">It is interesting to note that the Minister of State has suggested an increase in the board's membership from nine to a potential 15, nearly double the initial figure.  Three matters must be considered.  When the figure was originally nine, the members were to be drawn from persons, each of whom "hold or formerly held judicial office in the Superior Courts" or "are barristers or solicitors of not less than 10 years standing".  While these would be welcome members of an authority, one expects a regulatory body to comprise some trades people.  Given the potential addition of six new chairs at the table, there is scope for the inclusion of members of charitable organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1566">There is a great deal of merit in Deputy Wall's suggestion that the additional people be full-time workers in charity organisations.  Charities are quasi-voluntary organisations by their nature with, for example, voluntary boards of management.  However, they try to employ at least one full-time staff member to take on day-to-day responsibilities.  It is critical that the charitable sector be represented on the board.  It would make for a better configuration.  With respect to the Judiciary, barristers and solicitors operate in a particular spectrum, consider issues in a judicial manner and take legal interpretations of Acts and practices.  However, charitable practitioners possess a more rounded day-to-day flexibility and insight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1567">Given the Minister of State's proposal to increase the authority's membership from nine to 15, will he revert to the House with a representative selection process to draw people from the charitable sector after the Bill has passed through the Seanad?  Given that his amendment has overshadowed Deputy Wall's, I am prepared to withdraw the latter.  Considering the wider scope allowed, there should be a seat at the table for charity organisations.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_1568">I disagree with the amendment, not Deputy Ciarán Lynch, because it is overly prescriptive.  I agree with the Deputy's suggestion that someone involved in charities be involved in the board, but the amendment calls for a full-time employee.  I do not want the Bill to be so restrictive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1569">Amendment No. 102 refers specifically to "One of the 9", but a greater figure may be appropriate.  Being too restrictive is my primary reason for not accepting the amendment.  We have not yet sought board members.  This issue cannot be viewed in isolation.  Deputies questioned the appointment to the board of people with legal qualifications.  The Bill states that the Minister shall in appointing the members of the authority ensure that among those members are persons who have knowledge of and expertise in the law relating to charities, the keeping of accounts by and funding of charitable organisations and the management of charitable organisations.  To be fair, this indicates that people from a charitable background will be included.  The proposed amendment is too restrictive and excludes former charity workers and part-time workers involved with smaller charities.  I do not believe we should be this restrictive or that we should restrict ourselves to appointing only one person.  On those grounds, I am unable to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1574">Also, I thank the Ceann Comhairle, Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Acting Chairmen who have presided so efficiently over the passage of the Bill and, specifically, the Attorney General and his officials who have provided tremendous support at all times, as have the staff of the Bills Office in Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575">I believe we have had a constructive debate on all Stages and although there have been differing views on particular issues, we all had one objective, namely, to put in place an appropriate regulatory framework to enhance public confidence and to protect charities.  I believe the issues raised during the debate have resulted in amendments that have improved the Bill.  While we often divide on issues we have, through the overall package of measures introduced to regulate and provide public confidence in this sector without overburdening it, achieved the right balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1576">I hope the provision that those who are registered with Revenue will transfer across to the authority provides some comfort to those charities concerned from day one about issues of compliance.  Also important is the commitment to review this legislation in five years.  We may not have got everything right but we have moved a long way towards doing so.  I hope this will be beneficial legislation that addresses many of the issues raised in this House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1577">I thank the Minister and his staff for their many long and courteous briefing sessions on this complex legislation.  I also thank Áine Kilroy for her assistance.  The legislation was first introduced in the House last December and Committee Stage was dealt with in January.  We encountered many problems with this complicated legislation in terms of obtaining legal advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1578">I welcome the legislation, as do the charitable organisations.  I hope it works.  We do not want to over-regulate charities, who do a valuable job, but to make it easier for them to do their job.  The general public welcomes this legislation which will regulate charities in terms of permits and their accountability to the regulator.  We have a number of regulators in this State and do not necessarily require another one.  Perhaps the Minister of State will take another look at this issue which I had great difficulty earlier trying to get agreement on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1579">I hope this legislation works and deals with issues such as those relating to mass cards and clothing collections, which is a big issue for people.  The people of Ireland are generous; they are good at supporting charities and their own.  However, they hate to be ripped off by unscrupulous people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1580">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his courtesy during the debate.  I enjoyed participating in the passage of this new legislation.  I hope that if a problem arises with it, it will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1581">I welcome the legislation.  As in the case of other legislation, this Bill was slipping through the House under the radar, the manner in which most charity is done.  I believe this is informative and important legislation.  As stated by Deputy Ring earlier, it is necessary that the content of this legislation be publicised and promoted.  We, as Irish people, have a strong tradition of voluntarily donating money to people collecting on the street or of setting up standing orders for payments to charities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1582">As I said earlier to the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, the biggest donation by Irish people was to the Live Aid concert during the last recession.  I do not know whether another Live Aid concert is planned and whether the same will happen again but we are in recession again.  Even in times of recession, Irish people give to charity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1583">The legislation will be sent this evening from this House to the Seanad and will be reviewed in five years time.  The Minister, his officials, Deputy Ring and, in particular, my party colleague, Deputy Wall, have done good work in respect of this legislation.  The objective and desire, in respect of legislation which passes through this House, is that it will work well.  A non-partisan view was taken in regard to this particular legislation which is to the betterment of society.  I believe the House has done good work in this regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1586">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion on unemployment and the budget.  I thank Fine Gael for tabling such a relevant motion at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1587">Three weeks have elapsed since the coalition Government brought forward the earliest and probably the worst budget in the history of the State.  The first two weeks of these three brought more than 40,000 people to the gates of the Dáil.  Some 20,000 senior citizens braved the elements on two successive days to protest against the effective theft of the medical card from those over 70.  Approximately 10,000 third level students quickly followed their elders to the barricades to protest against the attempt to reintroduce third level fees by the back door by way of stealth taxes.  Some 12,000 parents, teachers and representatives of school management boards gathered together to protect the children of the nation against a range of insidious cutbacks in the classroom.  Only a hasty U-turn by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, avoided the wrath of the disabled community this week.  Next week, it may well be the farmers who will test the mettle of the rudderless coalition Government, whose members must now hang together or hang separately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1588">Virtually no sector of the community has escaped unscathed from the ill thought out budget and the most vulnerable and least well off seem to have suffered the brunt of the cutbacks, despite all that has been said to the contrary.  The ultimate cutback, however, has resulted in unemployment.  Workers have lost their jobs and have had their incomes wiped out and careers ruined.  In many cases, their families suddenly became impoverished.  For the unemployed, it is not a question of a soft or hard landing for the economy, of an international economic downturn or even of the country slipping into recession, as it has; rather, unemployment has been a traumatic, life-shattering experience for each of the nearly 100,000 workers who lost his or her job in the past 12 months.  It will be such for another 100,000 who, according to the ESRI report, are to lose their jobs in the next 12 months.  The wave of unemployment threatens to engulf spouses, children, friends, neighbours and the entire community.  An intricate web of educational, cultural and sports experiences are shattered by unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1589">The bail-out of the banks and financial institutions with an openended financial guarantee of taxpayers' money is the proud boast of this Government.  However, when it comes to bailing out the tens of thousands of people who are becoming unemployed, the Government has no proud boast, creative ideas, sense of urgency or, worst of all, compassion.  Spending on social welfare will increase in 2009 in line with the lengthening dole queues.  The new unemployed will be allowed to slip into the limbo land of welfare and settle into long-term unemployment or emigration, as happened in previous decades and as recently as the 1980s.  The humanity of the unemployed is greatly diminished in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1590">There is no new provision for upskilling and no new range of FÁS courses is being put in place, nor is there any self-employment incentive or creative vision to channel the new unemployed into areas of development, training and education and towards new opportunities.  The only action taken in the budget that impacts on the unemployed is a negative one.  The budget doubles the length of time needed for the unemployed to qualify for the jobseeker's allowance from one to two years and thus makes it more difficult to access.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591">This is a Government bereft of ideas which is only intent on its own survival.  The politics of self-preservation is the flip side of the politics of boom and greed and leads to lethargy and neglect of the people.  At the EU summit of Heads of State held the day after the budget, the dazed Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance appeared not even to have been aware that the other EU states were fighting unemployment and tackling the credit crunch through member state and EU initiatives.  For example, the European Investment Bank announced at the summit that it was making €30 billion available for small and medium-sized enterprises through low-interest loans to promote borrowing and through the circulation of money for investment in projects and enterprises, thus maintaining growth and protecting employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1592">Small and medium enterprises are the backbone of all economies in terms of employment.  It is time this Government came out of its bunker and began to offer leadership, direction and hope to the thousands of people its failed policies have driven into unemployment.  If it cannot or is not willing to do so, it should step aside sooner rather than later.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_515">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1593">The loss of almost 2,000 jobs a month in little over a year indicates the worst performance by any Irish Government in modern history.  During this morning's Order of Business, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, seemed clearly at a loss to understand the appalling crash in the labour market and totally bereft of ideas as to how the Government should respond.  That is why I welcome the general thrust of the Fine Gael motion before us, which seeks to build on my party's Private Members' motion on the unemployment crisis, considered a few weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1594">Every day in our constituencies, we hear of people being put on short time or being let go.  Young workers, in particular, are shocked at the poor levels of support and re-training that are currently available.  In my constituency, Dublin North-East, evidence of the recession is clearly visible in the monthly live register figures published by the CSO in respect of Coolock and Kilbarrack employment offices.  At the former office, for example, the number of unemployed rose by 35% between October 2007 and September 2008.  At Kilbarrack employment office, the number of unemployed soared by over 40% in just over a year.  A cursory glance around the country indicates shocking and alarming increases in the rate of unemployment.  Nevertheless, in the recent budget, the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance proposed no national or regional initiatives of any kind to address the awful decline into unemployment.  Even worse, the Government maliciously attacked the available social welfare supports for the newly unemployed.  My colleague mentioned the serious restrictions the Minister for Social Welfare introduced in respect of the jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit and the health and safety benefit.  She has doubled qualifying periods and shortened the periods to which the benefits apply to 12 months and nine months.  She introduced a miserable €6.50 increase for those in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance over the longer term.  The tactic of the Government is to abolish all types of jobseeker and illness benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1595">Clearly, the looming unemployment crisis requires a combination of macro and micro approaches.  On the macro side, the Labour Party is the only party so far to outline a credible programme to sustain jobs and refloat the economy.  Our strategy for stabilisation and growth was an excellent first attempt to create a national recovery programme.  Labour's proposals include restimulation of the construction industry through a school building programme and national insulation scheme, a new affordable housing scheme, active and dynamic labour market programmes, targeted investments in education and high-tech start-ups and a medium-term fiscal framework for the public sector.  However, the Taoiseach, allegedly an admirer of Seán Lemass, has failed to grasp the need for strong national economic leadership, as he demonstrated again this morning.  The Government, and sometimes our Fine Gael colleagues, at times confuse the needs associated with fiscal and budgetary difficulties with the much greater needs of the economy and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1596">Several elements of the motion refer to the need for FÁS to respond more actively to the tightening jobs market.  I strongly support the idea of greatly expanding the back-to-education allowance, whereby FÁS and the third-level institutes and seven universities would be required to utilise spare capacity to re-educate and further educate workers who become unemployed in the recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_1597">At a recent session of the Committee of Public Accounts, at which FÁS's CEO Rody Molloy was responding to criticisms by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the running of the organisation in recent years, I asked Mr. Molloy to put FÁS on red alert to address rising unemployment levels and, in particular, to take action regarding apprentices.  Day in, day out, many apprentices lose their sponsors as small companies make cutbacks, yet we have created no programme to address this.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach will remember that former Governments of which he was a member, when faced with economic circumstances of the kind we face today, asked the semi-State companies and larger ones, such as Ryanair and Tesco, to employ apprentices actively and have them secure their FETAC qualifications.  I ask the present Government to consider this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1598">My colleagues, Deputies Quinn and Howlin, and other members of the Government in the mid-1980s invented the community employment schemes.  Tens of thousands of citizens have participated in the schemes, retrained and obtained their first jobs as a consequence.  Some of the conditions for community employment schemes have always been too restrictive.  The Government should reconsider this area, particularly as part of a national recovery programme, which it should consider introducing after Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1599">One key gain from national partnership is the national network of partnership and Leader companies and also the county and city development boards.  It is now time to re-energise these bodies and give them a well resourced mandate to promote employment and local enterprise.  A first step would be to abolish the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and merge Pobal and FÁS into a new training, employment and support agency.  One of the biggest acts of vandalism by the Minister of that Department, Deputy Ó Cuív, was his abolition of the social economy programme.  This was a deliberate, PD, neo-conservative ideological assault on social enterprise.  Worldwide experience across Europe and the USA, from the John Lewis Partnership in the United Kingdom with 80,000 workers who own their own company, to the Publix supermarkets in the US with 140,000 workers, indicate that the track record of social and worker-owned enterprise is deeply impressive.  Yet the mandarins in Deputy Ó Cuív's Department ignored all this and turned social enterprise into a bureaucratic community hall-minding fiasco.  The only solution for that Department is to return the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, to his Celtic twilight dreamland and let us get on with providing jobs for real people all across this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1600">I commend the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_516">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1601">I wish to share my time with Deputies Nolan, White, O'Connor, Byrne and O'Rourke.</p>
          <p eId="para_1602">As Minister for Social and Family Affairs, I am naturally very concerned about the number of people who are unemployed, those 250,000 individuals who are on the live register today and the impact this experience has on them and on their families.  On the one hand, my role is to ensure that we have sufficient finance to support these families, the dependent spouses and children.  However, the main aim is to get these people back to work, to be able to support them with education and training and to provide employment opportunities for them.  The Government is working well to do this and Ministers work in co-operation with each other.  We have constant contact through the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and there is also contact between relevant Ministers to ensure that we can meet the needs of unemployed individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1603">We do this in a number of ways.  The people involved are of different ages, backgrounds and nationalities and have different work experiences.  We must therefore be able to target and match their experience with the work available and we must see what new responses we can produce.  Within my own Department we are working successfully in a couple of defined ways.  One is through our co-operation with FÁS and the second is by our activation programme, much of which is concerned with getting people back into education and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1604">The link between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and FÁS is absolutely crucial.  I have already met with FÁS representatives because I believe there are opportunities to facilitate more people with job interviews and support in order to help them get into training.  When people are called for interview by FÁS this leads to success.  Between January and August this year more than 40,000 people were referred by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to FÁS for interview.  These were people who had already spent three months on the live register.  It was a difficult time for them because within that time they had not found full or satisfactory employment.  The numbers called in the eight months this year was an increase on the numbers of last year which shows good productivity.  Of those called, 50% have left the live register, which is a success story.  Some were placed in jobs, some in training, some were interviewed and left the live register and some did not show up for interview but left the live register anyway.  There are many lessons to learn from that.  By increasing the number of people we contact to come for interview we hope to help support others to leave the live register.</p>
          <p eId="para_1605">The type of training on offer is critical and that is why FÁS offers modular flexible programmes to help people up-skill.  The fact that those programmes are certified means that the people on them are getting a valuable training and education.  In recent times FÁS is trying to respond to the needs of the individual.  Apprentices have been discussed in this House and there is an issue about apprentices who have not been able to finish their training.  However, FÁS is actively working to ensure that the particular needs of this group are being met.  When apprentices are properly skilled and trained they will have some hope of returning to the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1606">FÁS has also adapted the types of new courses it offers.  The training centre in Loughlinstown, for example, works very well with computer and high-tech companies in Cherrywood to meet their needs.  In this way people find that they are no longer merely responding to the needs of their employers but become very flexible and adaptable.  FÁS also offers programmes on the installation of new sustainable technologies and on environmental activity and trains to a very high level and this is the type of activity we wish to see continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1607">Those people who were called for interview but were not offered employment and who are back on the live register, will be called again in three months.  That is the type of co-operation there is between my Department and FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1608">The second major programme is the back to education allowance.  One of the most positive significant figures issued today by the Central Statistics Office is the 24% increase in the number of people accessing the back to education allowance.  I am really pleased about this because it shows that the focus that we put on it in the last few months is proving to be successful.  We held a seminar for facilitators all over the country to update them on the range of opportunities available.  Our facilitators are working on a local basis, with FÁS, the VEC and other education providers to see what is available for young people, focusing in particular on the 18 to 25 year old age group.  This is a way of supporting people by providing the equivalent of the social welfare allowance, the €500 cost of education allowance, in order that they can access the opportunities there for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1609">My Department is supporting people with welfare payments, with a budget of €19.6 billion next year and an increase included in that of €1.25 billion extra in order to deal with those who are unemployed.  More important, by supporting people through education and training in getting back to work, the Government shows it is serious about supporting those who are unemployed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MJNolan" eId="spk_517">
          <from>Deputy M. J. Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_1610">We are all too painfully aware of the international downturn and the effect it is having on our economy.  That is also reflected in the figures published today in respect of unemployment levels.  I am particularly concerned about the large number of male employees who have lost their jobs and continue to do so.  I wish the Minister every success in her programme for next year, which probably must continue into the following year.  This tries to help the group she identified, the 18 to 25 year age group who have found themselves without jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1611">We must acknowledge the economic challenges that currently face the Government.  It is to be welcomed that measures have been taken such as bringing forward the budget by six weeks and increasing the budget for Departments and areas within Departments in order to assist those who have found themselves on the unemployment register.</p>
          <p eId="para_1612">There will be much focus on the role of FÁS from now on in a way there has not been in the past number of years when we saw significant growth.  The agency will find itself the focus of much attention because of the downturn in the economy.  Continued provision of a range of training opportunities available to those who lose their jobs in the construction sector is one area that must be tackled.  I was pleased to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, bring attention to this and include such measures as the offering of a range of specific skills to workers and individual career paths to be developed for redundant workers.  In addition, attention must be given to retraining and up-skilling those workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1613">There are still many opportunities out there for workers who find themselves unemployed.  The provision of retraining opportunites for construction workers in respect of energy efficiency is one area on which I was glad to hear the Minister of State focus.  As night follows day we will see an improvement in the world economy and, one hopes, in the Irish economy within the short term.  If at that stage we have a re-skilled and up-skilled work force available to take the opportunities this will benefit not only the workers and their families but also the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1614">I wish to refer to one area, namely, community enterprise schemes.  These have been a great help to individuals who have been on long-term unemployment benefit or assistance and who are doing significant good work in assisting communities, particularly rural communities, in carrying out work which local authorities were not in a position to do.  I am glad that the budget for this has been increased and that this work will continue.  With rising unemployment levels we should use the opportunity. We should not allow unemployed people walk the streets, particularly young unemployed people.  In the 1980s young people who did not emigrate fell into an unhealthy routine of walking the streets, whereas those who took advantage of the education system were in a position to find good employment opportunities when the upturn took place.  I encourage the Minister to continue with this approach.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryWhite" eId="spk_518">
          <from>Deputy Mary Alexandra White</from>
          <p eId="para_1615">The Government is firmly focused on the challenges facing the economy and society in terms of finding new opportunities for those unfortunate people who have lost their jobs recently and those who may look into the abyss in the next few months.  There is no sharper reminder of how the recession is biting than the appalling live register figures published today which show that 11,700 people had to sign on in the past month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1616">Let us, however, focus on positive developments.  Last month's budget shows the resolve of the Government to facilitate opportunities to re-enter the workforce.  Additional funding of €11 million was allocated for community employment and job initiative schemes, all of which are of considerable benefit in towns and villages throughout the country; funding for FÁS services for people with disabilities was increased and €208 million was allocated for the national training fund for 2009.  These measures will help those seeking to start or continue apprenticeships or take part in other forms of training such as reskilling.  This is particularly important, not only for those who seek to return to the workforce but also to address the consequences of economic contraction and restructuring.</p>
          <p eId="para_1617">This time last year the ESRI, in its economic forecast for the final quarter, stated that "if labour cannot readily flow between sectors, the forecast for unemployment next year might be overly optimistic."  This statement has been borne out by trends this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1618">One area of employment opportunity which could create a significant employment is that of green collar jobs.  There are many opportunities to find enterprise and employment in this new era in which environmental protection is being incorporated into public policy and we face up to the task of addressing climate change and peak oil.  Energy efficiency requirements under new building regulations present opportunities for roofers, carpenters, electricians and plumbers.  The renewable energy sector is also growing, while agriculture offers opportunities through the diversion of land from food production to energy production or forestry.  Countless other opportunities are available, including in the areas of water services investment and waste management.</p>
          <p eId="para_1619">As the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently reminded us, the green technology sector is worth €284 billion worldwide and is now larger than the chemicals or car manufacturing industries in Europe.  Deputies should hone in on this fact during the debate as we must grasp the potential of the sector through identification, planning, education and job training.  To this end, I am trying to have what is known as a Solitaire school established in Carlow in my constituency.  Ireland is the only country in Europe which does not have one of these schools, which provide training for renewable energy installers, whether in installing solar or solar voltaic panels or geothermal heat pumps, and confers European qualifications.  A Solitaire school would attract students to courses in the Carlow Institute of Technology and VEC schools in the county.  It is important to take an initiative in this regard to ensure we do not lag behind other countries in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1620">The budgetary increase of 9% in 2009 for county enterprise development is a positive measure.  The county enterprise boards play an important role in supporting micro-enterprises at crucial phases and in stimulating economic activity at local level.  This increase is complemented by the considerable funding announced this week for LEADER partnerships throughout the country, including in my constituency where the Carlow and Kilkenny LEADER programmes received €8.9 million and €11.5 million, respectively.  This funding will go a long way towards developing employment and stimulating economic growth in rural areas, particularly among our 250,000 small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621">The months and years ahead will be tough and retraining and restructuring will be vital to our survival.  If we put in place the resources and schemes to do this now, we will have a more secure economy and labour force in the medium and long term.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_1622">I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important and timely debate.  While I am sometimes reluctant to discuss my constituency in great detail, I was reminded during the contribution of the previous speaker that Deputies should not be afraid to talk about the area from which they come.  My colleagues will be aware that I am from Tallaght.  Deputy Leo Varadkar told me earlier that he expected me to refer to Tallaght during this debate.  I am not afraid to refer to Tallaght and the wider Dublin South-West area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1623">I, like every other Deputy, must face the challenge of job creation.  Throughout my career, whether as a community worker, councillor on South Dublin County Council and Dublin County Council or Dáil Deputy, I have never been afraid to discuss the positive contribution that can be made to Dublin South-West and the job creation challenges facing the area.  Recent figures indicating that 5,303 people are unemployed in Tallaght, of whom 3,710 are males and 1,593 females, highlight the problem facing the area.  I was a founder member and chairman of the Get Tallaght Working group in 1984 at a time when we had to focus on job creation needs.  I am glad that in the intervening period, particularly since the opening in 1990 of The Square, it has been possible to meet the area's employment needs.  Tallaght, the third largest population centre in Ireland, has become a positive, progressive place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1624">While I sympathise with Deputies who make the case for their respective regions, Tallaght and the surrounding districts in Dublin South-West have a credible case to make.  I will continue to approach Ministers on behalf of my constituents.  Without wishing to get the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, into trouble, he has always been supportive of my work.</p>

          <p eId="para_1634">I could lose my job but I am a democrat.  It is important to support those who need employment and assistance.  We must continue to ensure the system operates in a sympathetic manner when people need services or assistance, while also ensuring it is not left open to being abused.  It is always necessary to tweak the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1635">Reference was made to FÁS, which has a first class facility in the Cookstown industrial estate in Tallaght.  While it does a superb job, it must do more to assist those who are unemployed and face challenges.  As the Minister noted, such people need special help.</p>
          <p eId="para_1636">We need to take a different approach to community employment schemes, which have evolved considerably over a long period.  I was contacted during the week by a person of 45 years of age who was told it would not be possible to extend participation on a community employment scheme until the person reaches 55 years.  The new difficulties we have must be given special consideration and I hope common sense will prevail in our approach to these issues.  Looking at television all day, Barack Obama reminds us that it is a time to change and evolve and respond to the needs of people.  He said something very interesting this morning, which I will continue to bring to all my work.  He said, "I will listen to you, especially where we disagree".  As far as these policies are concerned, that is important.</p>

          <p eId="para_1637">I will continue with what Deputy O'Connor said about Barack Obama.  Those of us who have been inspired by the civil rights movement in America, Booker T. Washington going to the White House and President Truman desegregating the army are aware that it is a fantastic time for the world when an African-American can become President of the United States.  It is a moment of change, as Deputy O'Connor said, but a moment of challenge as well.  New challenges are arising, but that problem seems to be solved in America at least at this stage.  They have new challenges but the challenge we are facing today, and debating, is unemployment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_1641">The issue we are discussing tonight is very serious.  Over the past decade we have seen incredible growth in the economy.  In the past 11 years, coinciding with Fianna Fáil being in Government, some 640,000 new jobs were created.  However, right now we find ourselves in the middle of an unprecedented global economic crisis.  One hears people describing it as possibly the worst since the great depression, or even worse than it.  Unfortunately, today, we see an increase in the numbers signing on the live register.  My constituency, area and family are not strangers to that phenomenon.  It is affecting families across the country.  Although the Irish rate is still lower than the EU average, there is no denying that unemployment is on the rise.  It poses challenges for us as legislators and for the Government.  It is essential that the Government acts quickly, as indeed it has.  It is doing what it can to get our unemployment rate down, the economy back in track and people back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1642">Moving the budget forward helped the Government address the problem.  If the budget had not taken place when it did, there would still be an enormous degree of uncertainty and speculation over what might or might not happen and that would not be helpful, given the challenges we face.  One of the most important steps we need to take is to invest in the skills of our people.  We must ensure Irish workers have the skills and training they need.  The budget allocated €1 billion to FÁS.  The only problem I have with FÁS, which is doing great work, is the emphasis it places on construction skills.  My fear is that with the rate of house building we had, which presumably will not happen again, there is a certain cohort of workers who simply will not work in construction any more.  This is because we will not be building houses in the numbers we have been over the last few years.  These people will need to be reskilled in different areas, if not in totally different sectors, and not just construction.  Deputy White mentioned green collar jobs and I agree with her in that regard.  However, a certain cohort of such workers will never work again in construction.  They will only attain the success they deserve by retraining or reskilling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1643">Some €208 million will be spent this year on training unemployed people.  This means that workers who recently lost their jobs should and can be taught the skills to enable them find work and begin new careers.  Under the disability heading, some €78 million is earmarked in the budget towards providing employment and training opportunities and programmes for the disabled.  We have to monitor all of these programmes as well to ensure they are doing what they set out to do.  I spoke yesterday to the chief executive officer of my local VEC and he mentioned a number of programmes he thought were wasteful.  He said they were not achieving the objectives intended for them and were just giving people somewhere to go on a daily basis.  That is not what Government funding is about.  Whether it is for the unemployed or the disabled, we must ensure that the programmes we have in place do what they were meant to do — improve the opportunities available to the people on those courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1644">Every type of business has been hurt by the global credit crunch.  The construction industry has been hit particularly hard.  FÁS is helping people find new jobs and to reskill.  We need people to work in new growing industries.  Environmental jobs were mentioned as well.  The national skills strategy was released in 2007.  The goal was to encourage workers of all ages to continue their education and included the concept of fourth level education as well, which is very important.  It is important to continue our commitment to the strategy.  We need to ensure workers remain competitive and skilled.  Investing in the workforce, as the Government is doing, will help ensure the economy will improve as quickly as possible.  Training and education will prepare workers for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1645">Again, I agree with Deputy O'Connor that the work being done by Ministers of State, Deputies Kelleher and McGuinness, and the other Ministers of State under the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, is fantastic.  They are deeply committed to the economy and workers, as is the entire Fianna Fáil Party, the other Government parties and indeed all the parties around the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1649">We all agree that unemployment brings misery, sadness and unhappiness to so many families.  We know that because we realise that for a long period doing constituency clinic work we were spoiled.  People were not concerned about getting a job, but rather how they would progress to the next job opportunity, as they attempted to up-skill.  It is a great sadness for such people, their families and children.  I can only imagine how people must feel at this time of the year as we draw towards the Christmas if they are unemployed.  For that sake alone, I strongly hope that employment will pick up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1650">There has been much talk about what the Government has not done, but I believe it has done a good deal about unemployment.  I heard Deputy Broughan, when I was in my office, talk about the fact that there were so many apprentices whose courses were not completed.  FÁS has taken specific measures to deal with redundant apprentices.  I have been reading about that and also the Léargas scheme, where a very strong effort is being made to place redundant apprentices in positions where they can continue their training and have job opportunities.  Armed with their training and skills certification, they can literally travel the world and get a job, although obviously one would wish they might get a job at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1651">I am also very keen on the whole Skillnets programme and I have officiated at the launch of such initiatives around the country.  They are wonderful.  A very good one is under way at the moment, catering for management and future leader levels.  The participants shape the course to suit themselves.  They give feedback as regards what they want in the course and how they are getting on and it is a very worthwhile endeavour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1652">Regarding FÁS, the Tánaiste was right, as was the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, when they said that whatever irregularities there were must be attended to and erased.  However, some people are reluctant to say a good word about FÁS.  I have nothing but the height of praise for it.  I worked for two and a half years with Deputy Ruairí Quinn, a great man to have as a boss.  He and I worked closely together on that whole FÁS programme.  At that time FÁS relinquished the tag of social employment and started the community employment projects.  There is not a village in this land that has not been changed and touched by FÁS.  It has changed the face of Ireland.  People have been trained on it, done such worthwhile community work and gone on to job opportunities.  It is actually on-the-job training, which is brilliant, and it has developed so many other skills within the repertoire of what it can offer people.  I hope that whatever small cloud hangs over FÁS will not linger and that, unfettered, it will be able to press on with whatever programme of work it has ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1653">I put on record my admiration for an agency that has much to do in this small country — to provide employment chances, advanced and apprentice training, one step up and community employment programmes, etc.  The range of courses and facilities on offer is significant and I hope that under the tutelage of the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, whatever cloud hangs over the agency will soon be lifted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1654">I would also like to say a good word about the Minister of State, who is here.  I have found him approachable and adaptable and, as a Cork woman, the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, will know this, too, of course.  He is interesting to listen to and keen to meet people, learn what he can from them and help them to go forward in whatever scheme they want to join.  I wish I had more time to speak.  I hope the measures being put in place for the unemployed will be effective.</p>

          <p eId="para_1657">There is so much loving going on here tonight that I should look for a bucket.  Following on the figures released today, this debate has much more relevance.  The figures show the situation is very serious.  In the past month alone, following seasonal adjustment, the figures have increased by over 15,000.  That is a substantial jump in one month.  The unemployment figure now is at a seriously high 260,000 and this calls into question the unemployment figure mentioned in the budget for next year.  That figure is way off.</p>
          <p eId="para_1658">We have big problems and must face them.  I am afraid we will be back here next year facing a possible 10% or 12% unemployment rate, or even higher if we are unlucky.  We must get serious about the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1659">There is a lack of realism in the House, especially on the Government benches, about the seriousness of the situation.  We accept that jobs were created over the past ten years.  The Minister of State will recall that I complained last week about the Minister's speech and about the praise he lavished on the work done over the years.  I agree work was done, but that is over and we must now deal with the current position and consider how we can get through the difficulties we face.  We cannot just keep talking about all the jobs created in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1660">The Minister of State stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1661">The Government has attached the highest priority to assisting these people.  We will continue to direct the necessary resources to the employment and training support services, which will provide a helping hand and assist these people in securing other employment as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1662">What is the difference between that and previous statements?  I see no new focus in this, and nor is there any new focus demonstrated in anything that was said last night or tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1663">The Minister of State also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1664">The Government has already taken decisive action to respond to the challenges we are now facing.  We have shown leadership and sent out a strong message that Ireland is responding to the global economic crisis in a proactive and prudent manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1665">I must have missed something, because I have been around here for the past couple of months but have not seen this happen.  Nor has anyone else.  We cannot create an illusion around ourselves.  We must realise that things must change and that we must do things differently.  It is useless to just talk about changes and to claim we have reacted.  We have not reacted and no change has been made.  If we had reacted, unemployment would be decreasing rather than increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1666">The Government's amendment to the motion suggests the Government has taken early action to address the deterioration in economic and fiscal prospects by introducing the 2009 budget early.  It has not done this.  Instead, it has brought total confusion and disarray, it lacks confidence and has failed to bring stability to the situation.  We all thought bringing forward the budget was a good idea because it would bring stability and let people know what was going to happen over the next year.  However, that has not happened.  The budget is dead.  It has fallen apart at the seams and there is a view we will have to wait until April or May for the next budget to address the problems.  That is the reality.  Those people with money who might be in a position to create jobs will hold back, as will people who want to buy houses, because they do not know what will come next.  The Government has failed to bring stability and confidence to the situation and this will have serious consequences for employment in the months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1667">The Government amendment states the Dáil supports the Government in stabilising the financial services sector so that Irish enterprises, small, medium and large, have improved access to funds.  The Government praises itself for this, but this has not happened.  The Minister of State said last night that he was concerned the banks might target the productive areas of the economy.  He is right about that.  It is clear he did not write the Government amendment because he is right and should be concerned.  Banks are not making money available to small businesses, or any businesses and this is a reason jobs are being lost.  Companies and small and medium businesses in all areas that we thought were secure and would last forever are now losing jobs.  Each day we hear stories such as that 70 jobs are going in one area and another, ten will go the following week and the business will be gone in six months.  Daily, we get telephone calls from businesses that cannot get money to keep them in business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1668">Banks write to businesses now to warn them their overdraft is, for example, €25,000.  They warn that the following week this will be cut to €12,500 and a month later it will be withdrawn.  This is no way to treat businesses.  How can they cope with this situation?  The Government has a duty to work with the Financial Regulator and the banks to address the situation, particularly in view of the fact that so much has been done for the banks in terms of the guarantee.  I understand the guarantee was given to protect the economy, but the banks have been helped by it.  We should have a <i>quid pro quo</i> and get something back from the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1669">The Government amendment mentions the county and city enterprise boards and the work done in that area.  The Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, spoke about an extra €3 million, which only amounts to approximately €100,000 per county.  The enterprise boards do excellent work and should be better funded.  The majority of them have been cash strapped since the middle of this year.  Therefore, providing them with an extra few euro for next year will not make a significant impact.  We will have already lost six months by then.</p>
          <p eId="para_1670">I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, to take another look at this and find more money for enterprise boards, because they create jobs.  Significant numbers of applications have been submitted to the boards by people who want to start businesses.  They cannot get money from the banks so must get it some place else.  If the Government cannot convince the banks to make the money available, it must bring in its own scheme for funding loans for small and new businesses.  I acknowledge the Government mentioned providing tax deferral to new companies, but it should also consider tax deferrals for existing businesses in order to save jobs because these businesses are under pressure.  Despite the pressure under which businesses operate, the Minister brought forward the date for paying tax, sucking cash out of the system rather than pumping it back in to give the businesses the opportunity to survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1671">The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, patted himself on the back yesterday for having segregated Enterprise Ireland and enterprise boards, thereby doing away with the confusion that existed about them.  There is confusion.  The members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment spent the summer visiting enterprise boards and chambers of commerce in the greater Dublin area and learned there is confusion about which companies belong to the various areas.  I am aware Deputy Kelleher and Deputy McGuinness have a big interest in this area, but they must get real about the situation and the confusion and try and deal with it.  The rules relating to the enterprise boards must be changed.  Currently the rules are too tight with regard to whom the boards can give assistance and grants.  Circumstances are different now and we must make changes to go forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_1672">The Government has suggested that FÁS will receive extra money for training, etc.  I welcome this because the Fine Gael motion is concerned with providing money for training so as to provide opportunities for people.  It is intended that €9 million will be made available to help apprentices to secure the job experience they need to complete their training.  However, nothing is said about how this will be done.  FÁS set up a working group in April 2007 to sort out the apprentice problem, but despite being repeatedly asked to explain what is to be done, it has not come up with a solution.  Last night again, the Minister of State mentioned the problem would be dealt with, but no plan has been put forward for doing this.  What is the plan and can we see it and help with it?  I have said previously that this side of the House is willing to work with ideas, not block them or cause confusion, but if we are not provided with information, we cannot do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1673">Many of those who made speeches last night spoke about what the Government intends to do and the language used gave no guarantees or targets.  I am unhappy with that kind of approach.  The Government approach should be to say what it will do and should set and meet targets if it is to spend extra money in the training and employment area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1674">My hobby horse is the need for new labour or skills activation schemes.  We accept the CE schemes do a great job for some sectors.  They do excellent work, but we should try to tweak these schemes and improve the work they do.  However, many people who have lost their jobs in the past year do not qualify for any of the existing schemes.  They are highly skilled and we must find a way to match them with jobs through some kind of labour activation scheme.  This must be possible and we must consider how it can be done.  This suggestion was made in a speech, but no definite proposal was made.  Fine Gael has suggested this repeatedly but has not been given any satisfaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1675">How difficult is it to match skilled people with jobs?  Deputy Enright mentioned last night that the cost to the State of an unemployed person is approximately €350 a week, if not €400.  Surely, we should be able to find some useful work for that person that would give them a little extra to add to that €350, sufficient to encourage them to do that work.  All of society would gain from this.  This is what we must do.  We must use our imagination, talk the ideas through and see if we can come up with a better solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1676">Many speakers last night spoke about the significant number of people under the age of 25 who are out of work.  We must direct some schemes at this problem.  I urge the Minister of State to look at the New Deal scheme that operates in Britain, which works well.  It is a focused scheme and is directed specifically at this age group.  It gets them into a job by providing a grant or subsidy to employers to take them on.  We must do something similar.  We need a specific scheme for the under 25 group and specific labour activation schemes for other categories.  We must have four or five schemes that will match people and their skills with jobs.  We must get people working.  It is not good for people used to working to be left sitting at home.  We have a duty to get them back into employment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1677">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and thank Deputy Varadkar for proposing it.  Even though this issue is becoming increasingly important, the most obvious feature of the Government's response is a lack of imagination.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is working to the same plans it devised ten years ago.  It has no sense of urgency in regard to what is happening.  Like others in the Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, is not being realistic about the current economic climate.  Imaginative ideas are badly needed to support younger members of the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1678">Over the past several years my home county of Wexford has relied heavily on the construction industry.  I do not doubt that other counties had a similar relationship of dependence but County Wexford has lacked the advantage of having a senior Minister who would encourage investment and industrial development in the county.  I have regularly warned this House about our dependence on the construction industry.  Small business people in Wexford have worked hard to achieve their current positions in life.  The soft furnishing and engineering companies which employ 100 or 200 people did not receive a penny from the Government, the IDA or Enterprise Ireland.  These companies are now feeling the pinch.  Deputy English rightly criticised the failure of banks to offer credit to small companies.  Over the past year, credit availability has tightened significantly with the result that companies are forced to close.</p>
          <p eId="para_1679">Young people who are in the middle of their apprenticeships with carpentry, electrical and plumbing companies are being let go.  What is to happen to these people?  I have contacted FÁS, the Minister and the Minister of State on a number of occasions to raise this issue only to be told that nothing can be done.  That is a further example of the Government's false commitment to young people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_1680">Ireland was the first of the eurozone countries to enter recession and unemployment is rising more quickly here than any other country.  We are witnessing the worst slide in the public finances of any eurozone country since the beginning of Economic and Monetary Union.  The boom and bust pattern designed by this and previous Governments has severely damaged Ireland's economic resilience and its ability to recover from downturns, yet we are forced to listen to the mantras about the worldwide situation which are trotted out by Government Members.  At least we no longer have to listen to last summer's catch phrase, "The fundamentals of the economy are sound".</p>
          <p eId="para_1681">This motion was tabled in an effort to force the Government to come to grips with the specific problems that have arisen in the area of training.  Our economy is suffering in this recession because of its slide in competitiveness.  In coming years, labour productivity and ability will be the key determinants of renewed economic growth in Ireland and increasing productivity will depend to a large extent on education and training.  A better educated and trained workforce will produce higher value goods and services and will be more likely to innovate.  The equation is: training equals productivity equals competitiveness equals recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1682">FÁS was established in January 1988 under the Labour Services Act 1987.  The board of the agency, which is appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, comprises employer and trade union representatives.  After 20 years is it not time to look at both the composition of the board and the functions it performs in regard to training?  Like any organisation in existence for 20 years, FÁS is in need of refreshing, restructuring and refocusing.  At the very least, we have to establish whether we are getting value for money from the agency.  The assertion by its CEO at a recent meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts that its services can only succeed if they are promoted and marketed effectively and that it is right that it has a substantial spend in this area misses the point and shifts the emphasis in priorities.  As far as I am concerned, the role and manner in which it carries out its work in these economic times requires little or no marketing or advertising.  During recessionary periods, individuals and businesses do not invest in the optimal levels of education and training.  The Minister for Finance could introduce an employer's tax credit to encourage investment in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1683">My constituency of Clare has experienced a 47.6% increase in unemployment over the past 12 months.  Unemployment figures have soared from 4,074 to 6,014 this year, which equates to the loss of five jobs every day of the last year.  One of the most frightening trends in the published statistics is the increase in the under 25 year old category as a percentage of the overall total.  The rate of unemployment among younger people is increasing.  This, if nothing else, should demonstrate to the Government the importance of acting on this Fine Gael Private Members' motion.  Training must be at the centre of any economic recovery plan</p>

          <p eId="para_1684">This is a very important motion.  However, Government Members do not appear to understand the groundswell that is occurring under their noses.  This morning, 252,000 people were on the live register, 100,000 of whom were working last year and did not expect to be made unemployed.  What is worse, however, is that the Government has no idea of how to address the crisis before the next 100,000 become unemployed.  It is certainly not coming up with suggestions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1685">The Government claims that it brought the budget forward in order to clearly demonstrate the principles on which a recovery would be based.  In my 30 years in this House, however, I have never seen a more disruptive budget.  It answered nothing and as every day passes different sectional interests pressure the Government into changing its mind.  Far from creating even a single job, the budget will result in further unemployment.  This is one of the misfortunes we are facing.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_1687">I have been in this House longer than most and I never saw more back tracking after a budget in my life.  All they are doing is apologising every day they are in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1688">There is the difference in the world between a pay-packet of €400 or €500 per week that is coming in through a job and the €200 that is received in social welfare payments.  They are a world apart.  There is no choice in social welfare, one is condemned to the lowest possible standard of living.  In fairness to the Minister of State, I have no reason to believe other than that Deputy Kelleher is doing his best.  The Government must get it into its head that there are people, now in their teeming thousands, who genuinely want to work.  As Deputy English stated, even a small top-up on that social welfare benefit would bring back their dignity and allow them to do useful work in the community.  Why is the Government not doing this?  The Government sat through the best of times yet it almost closed down community employment schemes.  When people had four, five or six years done they were air-brushed out of the system.  Why does the Government not examine this?  Regarding those of 45 years of age, there should be no one in FÁS or the Government saying that because someone spent so much time in a training programme the person is no longer eligible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1689">It is timely and appropriate that we are discussing this matter in the Dáil on a day when the CSO published its unemployment report and we have broken through the psychological glass ceiling with unemployment at 252,000.  As Deputy Connaughton said, 100,000 people have been made unemployed since the last election when the current Government took over with the answer to everything.  As far as unemployment is concerned, the Government has the answer to nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1690">I remember a predecessor of the Minister of State in Cork, a famous politician and leader of the Fianna Fáil party, Jack Lynch, said on radio one afternoon that any Government presiding over unemployment of 100,000 or more should not be in office.  It is now two and a half times that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1691">In Donegal, between September 2007 and September 2008 unemployment rose from 8,370 to 12,550 according to figures supplied by the CSO.  This represents an unbelievable increase of 50%.  Our industrial base has been eroded in Donegal these last ten years.  We have lost 12,000 industrial jobs.  There is a sad litany of job losses: Fruit of the Loom, which straddles the constituencies of both Deputy McHugh and I, Hospira in Donegal town, Parian China, BMR and UNIFY in Letterkenny, Dianorm, RMT, Europlast, Herdsman's in the Finn Valley and Nena Models.  The list is endless.  What will we do to address these major job losses?  Deputy O'Rourke is not in the Chamber now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1692">Very often, when we speak of job losses we say they are statistics but behind every job loss there is a sad story.  The person might be the only bread winner in the family, a widow or someone supporting an extended family.  The pain, loss of self-esteem and what accompanies the loss of a job is unspeakable sadness.  That is the tragic human story behind the loss of every job.  In the last year in Donegal there were 4,000 jobs lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1693">I implore the Minister to ensure roads and broadband infrastructure are upgraded.  I was disappointed to hear that the roll-out of broadband is postponed from 2008 to 2009 to 2010.  I was almost devastated when the capital budget for Údarás na Gaeltachta, one of the major job creating agencies in Donegal, was slashed.  This will have severe implications for jobs in the area I represent.  Something must be done for small industries, such as garages and other service providers, who are at their wits' end.  There is a shortage of capital and they are at the point of going under.  Unless something is done or there is a positive response from the Government we will have many more such job losses in the coming months.  Today we see the figure of 252,000 and shortly after Christmas and the new year that could increase to 300,000 or more.  We are about to go over the precipice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1694">There is so much more we could say.  The situation is critical in Donegal, with twice the national level of unemployment.  The Tánaiste is in the US this week and I hope she has something for the Irish economy when she comes back, particularly for Donegal and most particularly for her constituency of Donegal South-West.</p>

          <p eId="para_1697">They could be in Cork.  This is a suggestion I put forward 12 months ago and I want the Minister of State to take it seriously.  A gentleman can start 100 jobs in the area of the oil industry, involved in dredging, tug boats, dredgers, self-propelled dump barges, geographical survey vessels, oceanographic survey vessels and cargo vessels, which take 60% of world trade.  There are unemployed fishermen who lost jobs through the EU decommissioning scheme.  They are sitting in their homes but they are the deckhands, the engineers and first mates, the real workers on those boats, not the owners, who lost out on the decommissioning scheme.  We must consider a six-week training course, in either Greencastle or in County Cork, the county of the Minister of State, which would give them a licence to skipper these vessels.  I will not speak to the Minister of State in a patronising way or use this as a political opportunity.  The idea has been with the Government for the past 12 months, passed from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to BIM and to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The Minister of State as a Corkman, and I as a Donegal man, can provide jobs in the aquaculture sector and get fishermen back to work.  I ask for the indulgence of the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1698">At the macro level, if one listens to the people as a politician, for a period of six years people were saying three things.  They were saying that there is no way free money can be given away in the form of 110% mortgages.  They also said the boom would come to an end, that it could not last.  They said that there would be an end to the construction cycle for six to ten years but nobody listened to the person on the ground.  Now, going to branch meetings around my rural constituency, people are asking one question, which is known to those on this side of the House, namely, where all the money went.  Not every property developer has gone bust.  Money has been taken out of this State and invested elsewhere.  We must track it down because the people with the burden in respect of this disaster are those with mortgages.  Joe Public is carrying the can for this.  Deputy English referred to getting the economy back on track and getting it going.  In order to do so we must challenge the banks, which are giving deposit interest rates of 7%, trying to take money out of the economy.  Last week alone I heard of three people who tried to secure a car loan but the banks would not give them a loan.  That is the problem people are encountering.  We cannot bail out the banks without putting some responsibility on their shoulders to try to get the economy going again.  It is not happening.  That is the responsibility of the Members on the opposite side of the House.  We will support them with suggestions, as Deputy Varadkar is doing tonight.  We also have a responsibility in this regard.  I ask the Minister of State's indulgence on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1699">The Government has repeatedly proven its ability to manage the Irish economy, irrespective of the circumstances of the day.  Since we came to power in 1997 we have guided the State through one of the most remarkable transformations that has ever occurred in any modern economy.  We have created record levels of employment — an additional 640,000 jobs in the past decade.  We have significantly improved the standard of living for all our citizens.  We have invested in our future by investing historically high levels in our infrastructure, our education and training systems and the continued development of our workforce.  Over the past 11 years the Government has taken the necessary steps that will ensure Ireland continues to succeed in the future.  However, I acknowledge that Ireland like almost every other country is in the midst of an especially difficult time.  We are feeling the effects of the global economic storm that is currently impacting on practically every major economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1700">Earlier today the live register figures for October were published, which showed that more than 250,000 people were now on the live register.  This is very disappointing and heartbreaking for all those involved but is a sign of the difficult times we are experiencing as illustrated by the slowdown in the global and national economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1701">The Government is committed to addressing the significant problem of rising unemployment.  Over the course of this evening and yesterday we heard the efforts currently being made by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs, FÁS and other bodies to deliver the required support services to assist those who are unemployed.  Last month in budget 2009 the Government announced an additional allocation of €9.5 million to assist FÁS in responding to the increasing numbers of unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1702">We have initiated specific actions to respond to the large number of people who have lost their jobs in the construction sector, including redundant apprentices.  I am particularly conscious of the large cohort of people under 25 years of age who have lost their jobs in the construction sector.  Many of these people would have been in the apprenticeship system and that is why the Government is taking the necessary measures to ensure as many of these redundant apprentices are given the opportunity to complete their apprenticeship, which will assist them in securing employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1703">I can assure this House that the Government will continue to make strenuous efforts in seeking out job opportunities and up-skilling our unemployed to assist them in benefiting from the creation of new and forthcoming job opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1704">Apart from the role of the back to education initiative and VTOS, I would like to speak about skills.  As Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, I am strongly of the view that investment in the continued development of the skills and competencies of our workforce will provide us with the competitive advantage we require to continue to succeed in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1705">Our national skills strategy provides us with the roadmap for developing this advantage and making Ireland one of the most competitive knowledge based economies in the world.  The implementation of the ambitious vision contained in the strategy, namely the up-skilling of an additional half a million people by at least one level on the national framework of qualifications by 2020, will be challenging.  However, as the Minister of State who has responsibility for achieving this challenge, I am determined that we succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1706">I wish to reiterate that the Government has repeatedly proven itself capable of taking the necessary steps to safeguard Ireland's economy.  Our actions in recent weeks testify to our willingness to make tough decisions and to act in the national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1707">In response to the current difficulties, we have increased the measures of support available from the State to support those who have become unemployed.  We will continue to provide the unemployed with up-skilling opportunities and the continued support of a range of other schemes such as community employment schemes, the back to education allowance and the vocational training opportunities scheme to assist these people secure new employment as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1708">The Government will continue to manage the Irish economy in a manner that is sensible, responsible and appropriate to sustain our quality of life and our recent economic success in the coming years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_1709">I am delighted to speak on this important and timely motion tabled by our spokesman on enterprise, trade and employment, Deputy Varadkar.</p>
          <p eId="para_1710">I wish to make one reference to the budget. When someone makes a mistake, he or she should stop digging.  This budget is so flawed that at this stage the Government should throw it out and introduce a budget in the normal timeframe, which is early December.  There is a reason for that.  At that stage the Government has the facts in terms of the tax intake.</p>
          <p eId="para_1711">People will know the ROS system for filing tax returns and the majority of people use it.  They will not file their returns until 17 November.  People do not know the figures before then.  When dealing with a budget and the current financial situation, it is extremely important to deal in facts.  In the last budget for the current period, the Government projected a 3% increase in taxes.  However, there will be a 10% decrease in taxes.  The Government is projecting a 1% increase in taxes for 2009, but I do not believe that is correct, nor does anyone else.  How can the Government expect people to have faith in a budget when the assumptions and everything else on which it is based are completely flawed?  It fails in myriad areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1712">What should a budget do?  It should take account of the situation at hand.  It should bring in policies that ensure the vulnerable are looked after, which the Government did not do.  That has been demonstrated by the recent protests.  A budget should ensure that we restore competitiveness, which the budget has not done.  If anything, it has reduced it.  Effectively, it will add 1.5% to the rate of inflation.  It has done nothing in terms of freezing Government charges.  From a regional perspective of where I live in Limerick, the Government has imposed a €10 air travel tax deliberately on people taking flights from Shannon, which will penalise the region.  These measures depress consumer confidence.  Even simple measures apart from those in the budget should have been taken to improve competitiveness.  The price of diesel is 20% more than it should be relative to our EU partners, the price of petrol is 11% more and the price of heating oil is 13% more.  Why is this the case?  What is the Government doing about this?  It is sitting on its hands.  These are extremely important issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713">On the issue of providing greater support for business, to which Members have referred, one of the key factors affecting businesses is that people cannot get access to capital from the banks.  Any measure that is considered in terms of the banks must ensure that funding is made available to the people on the ground.  Overdraft facilities are been withdrawn on a daily basis from small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1714">Utility costs are another factor.  The ESB and Bord Gáis have today sought a 6% and 4% price increase, respectively.  The Government should ensure that does not happen.  Businesses cannot survive if they are not competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1715">In the seven years up to 2007, our competitiveness relative to our trading partners fell by 35%.  Our exports fell by 6% and the number of people employed in manufacturing fell by 27,000, a decrease of 9%.  This budget does not deal with what a budget should deal with.  It is a scattergun, "Yes Minister" budget.  The Civil Service and public service are there to implement Government policy.  This is a shambolic attempt at a budget; the Government should withdraw it and introduce a proper budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1716">I wish to deal specifically with investment in education and training.  There is nothing in the budget that deals with this issue in a practical manner.  Some 250,000 people are on the live register this evening, of whom 70% are males and there is an 82% increase in the number of males under the age of 25.  We proposed in our pre-budget document Recovery through Reform an allocation of €25 million to deal with retaining in the construction sector and proposed that €70 million be allocated to the back to education allowance initiative whereby people would not have to be in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance for more than a year.  They could go back to education and deal with the situation we have been dealt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1717">I wish to deal with my area of Limerick.  Some 9,000 people were on the live register up to the end of September.  We will not get the regional figures for the number unemployed until Friday.  I do not know why it has changed.  Previously we got them on the same day as the overall figures but now we need to wait another two days.  I spoke about this matter in the House last night, as the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, is aware.  There is a 50% increase with an additional 3,000 people joining the live register in the past year.  I asked for a task force to be set up to deal with the employment and retraining of people in Limerick.  Some 450 people have been let go from Dell in the past week, with a further 100 people let go from Flextronics and 65 from Banta.  I hope the Minister of State will take that on board.</p>

          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_1718">During my contribution yesterday I noted that Ireland was losing one job every ten minutes.  I now need to correct that statement because given today's figures, Ireland is losing a job every three minutes and I include in that Saturdays, Sundays, the evening time and holidays.  That is an extraordinary statistic.  During the time this debate has taken, 65 people have been made unemployed.  Today the seasonally adjusted figure for the live register is 260,000, which is much worse than I thought it would be and I am accused of being a prophet of doom.  At 6.7% we are getting very close to the EU average and I believe it is now a certainty that by Christmas we will overtake the EU average in terms of unemployment.  Already 16 out of the 27 EU countries have lower unemployment than we do.  It is certain that we will be ahead of the EU average quite soon.  I believe it is a certainty that we will overtake France, Italy and Germany in the next six months.  Those are countries we once considered to be high-unemployment countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1719">While international factors certainly affect this downturn, all those countries are also on planet earth and are affected by the same international criteria.  In the United States unemployment is at a five-year high, but in Ireland it is at a ten-year high.  In Germany unemployment is at a 16-year low, but in Ireland it is at a ten-year high.  There can be no question about the depths to which we have sunk compared with other countries, big and small, open and closed economies alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_1720">I see a certain parallel in the Government's attitude to the recession, which initially was described by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, as a welcome correction.  It then became a downturn and eventually a slowdown.  After many months of denial the ERSI pretty much forced the Government to abandon its denial and accept there is a recession.  Then of course we had panic.  The same has occurred with the public finances.  We were told that it was not that bad, the fundamentals of the economy were sound, we had a very low national debt  and, as we were not borrowing that much it was acceptable to borrow money for capital resources, etc.  Then suddenly the Government had to accept the real problem and now, according to the Taoiseach, it is the worst situation for 100 years, which again is panic.  That is a total exaggeration.  It is not the worst situation for 100 years.  It is probably the worst situation for 25 years but not 100 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1721">I see the same kind of attitude of denial from Government.  While unemployment is increasing in all sectors the Government claims it is not that bad and that it was much higher 11 or 12 years ago when the country was a very different place.  I expect that unemployment levels will hit 300,000 by approximately February or March and perhaps 350,000 by the end of next year.  Then, of course, a year too late, there will be panic and the Government will propose solutions that will not work at that stage.  That has been its approach to economic and social policy for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1722">The Government has made a bad situation worse.  The national wage agreement cannot now be afforded and I do not believe it will be paid.  Again there will be a panicked response in a few months' time when the Government will suddenly announce it will not pay it after all, having pretended it would pay it for several months.  That will have a knock-on effect on the cost of labour in the private sector which will also be asked to meet these increases even though it cannot do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1723">The Government has mistakenly decided to cut back the apprenticeship system even though this is one thing FÁS does well.  There is a failure to reform FÁS.  I accept that FÁS does some good work.  Any organisation that spends €1 billion must do some good work.  I make no criticism of people who participate in FÁS schemes.  However, I criticise the way that FÁS is managed.  I am not ashamed to make that criticism despite the fact that some of the Members opposite seem to go out of their way to defend FÁS and the vested interests that protect it.  This is an organisation that is subject to a Committee of Public Accounts inquiry, a Comptroller and Auditor General inquiry and a Garda fraud investigation.  We should not be ashamed, afraid or embarrassed to say there is something seriously wrong with that organisation.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_552">
          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
          <p eId="para_1724">It is not the organisation.  It is individuals in it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_553">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_1725">They are individuals in very senior management positions in that organisation who have done wrong and others who have done nothing about the fact that they have done wrong.  While I did not hear all of Deputy O'Rourke's speech, I heard part of it.  The Minister of State will be aware of matters that are not yet in the public domain just as I am aware of such matters.  Perhaps before he allows his party colleagues to make fools of themselves he should take them aside and tell them a bit more about what is going on in that organisation and what kind of investigation is now under way.  It needs to be dealt with and I hope the Minister of State deals with it.  He is one of the brighter and better Ministers and the issue falls into his area.  I hope he will deal with it because if he does not, when this party is in government we will do so and we will have no difficulty in pointing the finger at those who did not act when they should have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1726">The Government has not acted regarding the burden of regulation.  We have a verbal commitment to reduce the cost of red tape by 25% and yet have no interim figures as to what will be done this year, next year or the year after.  The cutbacks in infrastructural spending will put Ireland further behind.  In the past our economy was based on Ireland being a bridge between the United States and Europe.  In the future we will need to try to remodel Ireland to be a bridge between Europe and Asia and to try to attract the kind of investment that is now going into places like Austria, for some reason, and not into Ireland.  Despite this we have cut back the broadband infrastructure budget by 25%.  South Korea has already got broadband speeds that are 33 times faster than ours.  We cannot afford to fall further behind in such areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">The reality is that we cannot borrow, spend or cut our way out of recession.  We can only trade our way out in the medium term.  By further damaging our competitiveness and infrastructure the Government will make that much harder.</p>
          <p eId="para_1728">The Government has also increased VAT, which again is a big mistake that will have a serious impact on business in the new year.  It is allowing the cost of business to rise in terms of rates, development levies and the cost of utilities.  Those costs should all be frozen now.  It is increasing capital gains tax which will again make things more difficult.  There is the ongoing failure to recapitalise the banks, which needs to be done.  We supported the bank guarantee because it was the right thing to do.  However, we now need to take the next step and ensure that the banks are recapitalised and that the wheels of credit and the banking system work again.  There is no way we can get out of this mess without fixing the banking system.  There will be significant job losses in the coming weeks and months if we do not fix it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1729">Our motion proposes a number of very good ideas.  It is unfortunate that they are not going to be accepted.  We focused heavily on retraining and, as Deputy English mentioned, particularly identifying this new cohort of people who would not fit into a CE or JI scheme.  They are people who have never been unemployed and have been working for two to three years and paying taxes.  They now find themselves unemployed for the first time.  They could do work if there were an appropriate public works scheme in which they could participate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1730">There are many things the Government could do to make the environment good for job creation again, which is important.  Businesses will not take on new employees if the environment for doing so is not good.  The key things that can be done are to freeze the Government charges we mentioned, bring down those utility costs, invest in infrastructure — broadband in particular — cut back the red tape, reverse the VAT hike, address the realities of the pay deal being unaffordable at this stage and also consolidate labour law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1731">There is a huge body of labour law and it is very complicated.  I understand why NERA must exist and its job is to enforce the law.  However, some laws are archaic and are costing jobs.  I mentioned yesterday some of the issues concerning the requirement for double pay on Sundays and the JLCs in that sector.  They are costing jobs already and will cost more jobs.  It behoves the Minister of State to act appropriately in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732">All is not lost.  There is hope for Ireland.  We can still bring unemployment down.  We can still have good public services and we can still balance our budget, but only if the right policies are adopted.  However, it does not appear that the Government is prepared to do that.  Instead of just prosecuting the Government our motion proposes a series of ideas which it may well end up adopting in due course.  It is a shame it will not do it now and will continue to deny there is a problem and will be panicked into action in a few months' time.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1874">Prior to the introduction of budget 2009, Members on this side of the House, and I have no doubt Members on the other side, had great expectations.  We all knew tough decisions needed to be made but what we did not know was that those decisions would affect the young, the vulnerable and the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1875">The Government's budget, introduced two weeks ago, is a missed opportunity.  Many of the cuts will affect pivotal sectors, including the education sector and particularly primary and secondary education.  During the past couple of weeks, my office has been inundated with calls from parents, teachers and teachers' unions who have described as a disgrace what the Government has done to education in Ireland.  A child gets only one chance at primary education as compared to two, three or four chances to access third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1876">In opting to increase class sizes, the Government did not give adequate consideration to what it was doing.  The teacher unions showed their anger and frustration last week when they protested on the streets of Dublin against what the Government has done.  At a recent INTO meeting in my own county, I heard parents speak of their despair that their children, who are encountering serious difficulties in primary education, will no longer get the help they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1877">In my seven year political career, I have not witnessed the type of anger that was expressed by the elderly in the Westland Row church the week after the budget was announced about the withdrawal of medical cards from people over 70 years of age by the Government.  The over-70s are to be congratulated on the manner in which they ran their campaign.  While I welcome the Government's reversal of that decision, I do not believe it has gone far enough.  I have spoken to many retired people in receipt of old age pensions who have put away approximately €20,000 or €30,000 for a rainy day.  I am sure the Minister will agree these people are not among the 5% of our population who are the richest in this country.   I have no doubt that every Member's office will be inundated with calls when elderly people receive letters from the Health Service Executive stating they have to re-apply for their medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1878">I attended a lobbying session today of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA.  I spoke to farmers, their sons and other younger farmers.  What the Government has done to the agricultural industry in this budget is wholly disgraceful.  There must be incentives if we are to encourage people into agriculture.  Two of the more important incentives were the opportunity for a mother or father to retire and installation aid as a cushioned payment for a younger farmer coming in.  I come from a farming background and no younger farmer will want to come into the agricultural industry when he or she sees what the Government has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1879">Fine Gael has highlighted a number of these bad decisions over the past two to three weeks.  It is amazing when one listens to the Government's backbenchers because they are fully in agreement with the wrong decisions made by the Minister for Finance.  The Green Party has gone into hiding over the past number of days.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Mary White on my local radio station after the budget.  She was asked why she gave the Minister a standing ovation and she replied she was overwhelmed by the contents of the budget.  She is one of the people speaking out of both sides of their mouths over the past number of weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_1881">The Green Party has a role in Cabinet responsibility, as it has two senior Ministers in Deputies Gormley and Ryan.  They sat around the Cabinet table as these decisions were made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1882">Fine Gael has offered alternatives through our finance spokesperson, Deputy Richard Bruton.  Such alternatives are worth listening to and implementing.  Over the past number of years the Government was able to throw money at every problem in every corner of the country and had no difficulty doing so.  There was €10,000 here, €50,000 or €100,000 there and €200,000 somewhere else.  That money was tossed around by the Government over the past number of years without care.  There was no responsibility for spending or consideration for the future.  Such spending produced PPARS and electronic voting machines, which annoyed the public, but the public is also dissatisfied with the Government because of the decisions made in the recent budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1883">I have no doubt the Minister of State has listened to some of the concerns of his constituents.  We will feel the detrimental effects of this budget for many years.  I listened to the comments made by a backbench Deputy on one of the national radio stations and it was mentioned that the decision on class sizes would be reversed within a year or two.  However, I believe once the Government has decided to increase class sizes, it will never roll it back.  One should consider the anger felt by parents about what has happened in the education sector.  The Government has completely neglected the most important people in our society, the young people we will depend on to take up qualifications in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1884">There is no doubt that the Government went for the soft options in this budget, hitting, as I mentioned earlier, the most vulnerable.  The longer this Government continues in office, the longer it will keep its head in the sand.  Its members are drunk on power, arrogant and totally out of touch.  They are not living in reality.  Some of the senior Ministers are going around believing there is no problem and that everything is okay when it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1885">I would like the Government to listen to what the ordinary person on the ground is saying.  It could have made tougher decisions in other areas but it chose not to do so.  I was very annoyed about some of the decisions in this budget.</p>

The debate surrounding the education cuts in the budget is an exaggeration.  The Fine Gael spokesperson was not overly enthusiastic about the wages or salaries of teachers.  The party's finance spokesperson talked about adjusting to a €4 billion cutback but we only brought about a €2 billion cutback.  The party has left unanswered how it would find this €4 billion in cuts.  Would it close down the whole public and Civil Service?</p>

These require upgrading and I appeal to the Minister for Transport, through the Department of Finance, for extra funding for those two routes.  They carry significant volumes of traffic, especially during the summer months because of the tourist business from Rosslare to Killarney.  They are vital to the area's infrastructure.  I do not know the exact cost of the funding but not much would be needed to allow the upgrade.  I appeal for them to be looked after.  The entire problem has been brought about by globalisation in the world economy.  We were mad on it and globalisation was everything.  Everyone learned the globe when attending school and everyone knows where are the other parts of the world.</p>

The same thing happened in my own locality, where we had a wonderful organisation called Dairygold.  It used to turn over €1 billion per annum, killed 500,000 pigs and 100,000 cattle, as well as processing approximately 200 million gallons of milk into substantial and good brands.  All now is gone.  A chief executive came in there four or five years ago who diversified into the construction industry.  Although he was going to build empires in the towns and villages, all that remains to us is rubble.  We have loads of rubble in Mallow and Mitchelstown.  The reason I mentioned the N72 and N73 is because the rubble would be ideal to rebuild those roads.</p>

Such people will have paper shares and I do not know when they will grow again, expand and pay out dividends.  I noted the bank today referred to 2011 and possibly later.  Such people now are paupers because the small amount of capital they possess precludes them from qualifying for a non-contributory old age pension.  Many such people have contacted me and I am quite concerned by this issue.  I acknowledge the banks and all businesses must improve their capital base.  The only way they can do that is by not paying a dividend, rather than engaging in scrip issues and whatever goes with so doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1968">In respect of interest rates, I made a point in the House some weeks ago about the manner in which we had behaved.  Developers bought land from farmers at crossroads and paid small money for it.  They then developed such land by putting water or sewage pipes into it thereby increasing its value three, four or fivefold.  Moreover, they got away with 20% capital gains tax.  Had that tax been set at a higher level, we may not have had the problems we face today in respect of developers.  As I have suggested previously, we should have a much higher rate of tax for speculators than for the ordinary Joe Soap.  Although the man on the street expects an increase of 2% or 3% in his wage packet, share options was the name of the game for these people.  I invest heavily and make no secret of it.  I have suffered a lot in recent weeks and make no apology for that either.  Members will see that my returns for next year will not be better than those for last year.  I can live with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1971">I grew up in a house in which finance was discussed and this economy used to have high interest rates to discipline the economy.  During the past ten or 12 years, although Japan has set both low and zero interest rates, it still has not emerged from its difficulties.  The only way in which one can discipline an economy is to have higher levels of interest.  Low interest rates and zero interest rates were set in America four or five years ago and further back but it has not done them any good.  If one wishes to stop spending, one must make it expensive to spend and we should have done that.  I remember the 1950s and 1960s when de Valera and Seán Lemass were in power.  They used to operate credit squeezes and would increase interest rates.  The Central Bank then had much greater authority and control than is the case at present.  While one criticises the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, this might not be justified because of the Single Market and of events in Europe, which governed them to an extent.  Perhaps we are taking a wrong direction.  Although we have been boastful about reducing interest rates, it appears the financial institutions are not able to lower such interest rates as they should.</p>

          <from>Deputy Edward O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1982">I came into the House this evening to develop a point I made previously.  I made a statement in the House in respect of the state of auditing.  To back up my statement, I can cite two major companies, namely, Enron in America, which was a huge company, and Parmalat in Italy.  They went to the wall during the good times but had they been properly audited in either country, they would not have experienced difficulties.  There is a need for a tightening of auditing and the structure of appointing auditors to limited liability companies must be changed in the Oireachtas.  There must be greater input into the selection of auditors.  Perhaps there should be a selection process, similar to that which has been put in place by the Minister for directors of banks.  The latter has not been announced yet but he is about to do it.  I envisage a system in which there would be a panel of auditors from which they could be selected.  This would be the way to do it because we are losing out heavily in this regard.  I believe the banking problems in respect of the liabilities that have arisen and their foreign borrowings to fund the Irish market and perhaps other markets abroad, should have been seen by auditors.  Such matters should have been raised and such activities should have been brought to heel.  However, this was not done and that is where we are today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1983">On the Lisbon treaty, it is highly embarrassing for Ireland that it has not ratified the treaty.  We must work hard to get back into the mainstream of Europe, to become the model of Europe again and to become the favoured people in Europe.  We must get all sectors of society to support us.  I refer in particular to the farming community, which has most to lose in a scenario in which we are not in Europe.  I believe this must be done quickly.  I have campaigned for Europe more extensively than most because I campaigned for it initially in 1972.  It was obvious to me that those who opposed our accession in 1972 were still around and at some stage would get a victory, which they did in the referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1984">I do not worry about victories but what happened was a tragedy and it should not have happened.  I heard Cardinal Brady speak at today's meeting of the Sub-committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union.  He spoke about Europe and referred to Tory Island among other things.  In principle, he was in favour of supporting the Lisbon treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1985">Much has been said about school buildings in tonight's debate.  I understand that next year we will build 62 major school building projects and that we will build 100 school extensions.  In addition, small school work schemes will go ahead as well as devolved grants.  Many questions have been asked about Church of Ireland schools.  I have sympathy for the Church of Ireland as the minority religion.  Those schools qualify for a block grant of €3.8 million.  I have two minority schools in my area and I was concerned about them because they raised the issue with me.  I am grateful to the Minister for Education and Science for being helpful in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1986">It is difficult to debate an issue when things have been so favourable previously.  We had many good years.  However, all budgets are difficult.  We had a budget in 1997 that caused difficulties.  Every budget in recent years had its problems because it did not meet the requirements of every citizen.  People are fond of lobbying and creating a fuss about issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1987">I am impressed by the support of the Green Party, under the leadership of Deputy Gormley, for the Government.  He realises the importance of the economy and has put the national interest at the top of his agenda in supporting the budget.  That kind of commitment from a minority party is a sure sign of the importance of the issue at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_1988">We have to borrow €11.5 billion this year and we will borrow €13.5 billion in 2009 to keep public services afloat.  In 2009 alone that is equivalent to borrowing an extra €37 million every day of the year.  That is an indication of how serious is the matter.  We have gone from a position of substantial growth in the economy to not having any growth.  By 2011 that will mean additional borrowing of €45 billion.  That is an enormous sum on which to pay interest.  It is equivalent to approximately €10,000 for every man, woman and child in the country or more than €21,000 for every worker.  Ten per cent of day-to-day spending will be borrowed in 2009.  We must recognise that the figures are serious and accept the situation.  I hope the Opposition recognises that.  In fairness, the Opposition has been reasonably supportive but it has not answered my question on where it would make savings of €4 billion as opposed to the Government's €2 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1989">Much industry has come into this country in recent years, including from North America.  Today is an historic day in the United States with the election of Barack Obama.  I hope his commitment to this side of the Atlantic will be equal to that of previous US Presidents and that we can continue to have 100,000 jobs provided by North American industry in Ireland.  However, we must also praise our own company, Cement Roadstone, which employs 100,000 people across the world.  We have good businesses in this country and Cement Roadstone is one of our flagship industries.  It deserves praise for its commitment.  In recent days that company suffered substantially in the financial markets but for a multinational Irish company it employs a significant number of people.  We greatly admire the company and its managers who have brought such success to the organisation, with the island of Ireland acting as a flagship for us in all regions and continents around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1990">I also praise the American companies that are located in Ireland.  I hope they can all stay with us in spite of what has been said.  Dell is the one I am most concerned about because it generates significant employment in my area of Cork on the Limerick border.  I hear a lot about the company.  I believe Dell is committed to Ireland and I hope it can continue here.  The convoy of cars going from my area to Limerick city is reminiscent of the Munster final.  Dell is a major employer that has taken up the slack due to the loss of the food industry in my area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1991">The food industry is one thing that is near and dear to me.  Country of origin labelling must be addressed in an Irish context because of the huge amount of food imports that is taking from the livelihoods of farmers.  It is a major issue.  I serve on two committees of the House, namely, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Deputy Willie Penrose is Chairman of the former and Deputy Johnny Brady is Chairman of the latter.  They have done great work in the area of country of origin labelling but we are not making the kind of progress I would like.  If we do not make more progress we will have more imports.  Country of origin labelling is necessary to give choice to housewives.  It is important to know where a product comes from and to offer choice.  If we do not have that we will never have the wholesome Irish food we were used to in the past, such as the traditional Irish breakfast.</p>
          <p eId="para_1992">I am conscious of what is happening in the country in this regard.  We do not have any poultry processing such as we had in the past and there is no pig processing into a branded product.  We only have primary production.  There is no packaging or branding such as we had in the past and we are losing out heavily because of that.  Fifteen years ago or more when we were in Opposition I went on a trip to Chicago.  I was advised to take a case of Jameson whiskey and a case of Baileys with me for promotions there.  It was a St. Patrick's Day event.  Jameson was not attractive at that time.  Baileys was the in thing, and it still is.  It is one of the brand leaders in the country.  Jameson has been an outstanding success in the intervening 15 years.  It is now a brand leader that challenges the major Scottish whisky brands, which have been very successful across the world.  Jameson has been an enormous success under Irish Distillers and is an employer in my constituency, which I share with Deputy Stanton.  The company continues to expand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1993">We should not dismiss brands and say they are out of date.  We should promote them and develop them more.  That is why I refer so much to the food industry and what has happened in north Cork.  I am very passionate about what is happening there.  I am sick of it.  I cannot believe what has gone on there given the great success that emerged out of the developments from the 1930s.  There is no need for it.  My argument is that it was based on development and building.  We were going to build apartments and hotels.  We have built nothing only for all those places that are rubble.  I gave the example of Jameson.  Galtee cheese is gone; it is made abroad.  Shaws ham is packed in Scotland.  It came out of Mitchelstown.  No one knows where Calvita cheese comes from but if one looks at the bottom of the box it contains a little symbol and it states it was packed in England.  I do not know why we had to do this or why farmers in my area supported that kind of executive.  I call him Jerry Rubble now because that is what he is.  He is rubble.  I give the comparison between Jameson and why we lost our food industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_1995">I have it said now anyway.  It is on the record.  Country of origin labelling would do a lot for this country.  There is resistance in Europe to it.  What is happening is that all the foodstuff that I give out about are coming in through Rotterdam where some adjustment is made and it is sold across Europe.  What is happening is that chicken and beef come into Ireland with breadcrumbs or some such additive and until we correct that system we will have no success with Irish food.</p>
          <p eId="para_1996">Ireland is one of the most successful countries for the production of food in the world because we are surrounded by water.  It is a safe country.  I refer to the island of Ireland, North and South.  We have the ability to produce good food.  The farming community has lost heavily because it has failed to develop and protect its co-operatives.  We are seeing a downturn in agricultural prices and over-production in the milk industry in some parts of the world.  Milk is being produced in substantial quantities in America and New Zealand and much of that is coming into Europe in spite of the tariff barriers.  In the past, co-operatives were very vigilant, did great marketing for farmers and took their produce, but we have lost them.  The recession will inspire people to protect their businesses rather than enjoy the buoyancy that existed heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_1997">My constituency has done very well under Administrations over the past ten or 15 years.  There have been substantial new school developments and roads, and a new road is being built from Cork to Dublin.  There are many industrial developments in Fermoy and such places.  That town has done reasonably well and the new cattle mart has been grant aided by the Government.  It has been the flagship sales area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1998">I want to praise a few projects in my part of the country of which I am very proud.  I am very proud to have obtained Government support for them and hope I will continue to do so.  I hope that, in spite of the decline in prosperity and the difficulties that exist, we will still be able to grant aid and support deserving and necessary projects.  I have no doubt but that we will do so under the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The budget of the Minister for Finance was a Houdini job and was done very well.  It has been acclaimed and the people realise it had to be structured in the way it was.  Three major issues arose in respect of it but, ultimately, we have survived very well.  Not alone that, people accept the budget and believe what we did was right.  They are prepared to stay with us and support us in every way.</p>

          <p eId="para_2003">I believed the Deputy was doing it out of respect for the procedure of the House, but that is another matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_2004">I made the point in a debate in the House in July that inflation was the highest it had been for quite some time and that unemployment was rising rapidly.  According to a report on the day in question, electricity costs were due to rise by 20%.  I said we were facing a crash in the housing sector and a perfect storm in that everything was coming together.  Unfortunately, I have been proved correct in that everything did come together.  I stated in July that Ministers should appear before every Dáil committee to outline their plans in detail.  Unfortunately, this did not happen and the Government waited and let the summer go by as circumstances worsened.  It introduced a budget that was rushed, poorly thought out and lazy.  This is clear because, before the ink was dry, the Government had to row back on three major issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_2005">The Government made three major blunders.  It had to reverse the incorrect decision on medical cards for older people.  The original decision in this regard should never have been made.  It had to reverse its shocking decision on the disability allowance, which was also wrong and affected the most vulnerable despite the Minister for Finance telling us the budget was to protect them.  It did not protect them and the intention all along was to hit them, so to speak.  The Government had to reverse the levy imposed on those on very low pay.  This levy was a savage attack on people on the minimum wage.  These three reversals alone show the budget was poorly thought out and cobbled together.  It focused on hitting the most vulnerable and weak, which is worrying.  We have had meetings throughout the country with teachers, parents and farmers.  Government Deputies have said they are listening to these groups, feel their pain, will tweak this and that and see what happens in the Finance Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_2006">Many of the budgetary measures are self-defeating and I will mention a few, first making reference to education.  I know the area of education pretty well.  The Minister for Education and Science told us that research shows that reducing class sizes really does not matter.  I was curious about the research he quoted and asked him to identify it in a parliamentary question.  In a reply I received yesterday, he mentioned a study by Eric Hanushek.  This researcher found that effects of class size on student achievement were insignificant in 74% of the studies examined.  The Minister did not elaborate further on the study but I did some research and discovered Mr. Hanushek has had many critics.  A Policy Perspectives report, entitled "What Research Says About Small Classes and Their Effects", written in 2002 by Bruce Biddle and David Berliner, has pointed out that many of the supposed class-size studies cited in Hanushek reviews do not examine class size directly but rather a proxy measure presumed to represent it, namely, the student-teacher ratio.</p>
          <p eId="para_2007">Class size is vital.  The Minister makes the point that the quality of teaching is as important, if not more so.  I agree with him, but if he did his research properly, he would discover that most researchers state in their literature that class size is crucial in a child's early years.  They state small classes have a considerable impact that features for some considerable time.  Even if children end up in larger classes later on, they still benefit from having been in smaller classes in the first, second, third or fourth years of primary school.  Research has shown that class size affects the amount of time one spends in school and one's longevity.  Evidence shows good education improves people's health and well-being.  By increasing the class sizes of younger children, the Minister is doing an awful lot of harm that will have to be paid for in the future.  I ask him to reconsider his decision and not rely on one or two research projects.  I refer him to the student teacher achievement ratio, STAR, project in Tennessee, which was carried out over quite some time.  He should examine this and take his evidence therefrom when forming policy.  Let us have a proper debate on class size and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_2008">What has the Minister done in his budget to improve the quality of teaching in our schools?  He has got rid of the early retirement scheme.  If a teacher who is burnt out, tired and ageing wants to retire, he or she cannot do so.  The Minister now requires him or her to stay in the classroom with the small children until he or she reaches retirement age instead of facilitating him or her to leave to allow a young teacher, fresh from teacher training college, to take over.  I fail to see how this decision helps.  As I stated, the cuts have not been thought out or examined properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_2009">The free books scheme has been hit, so to speak, as has Traveller education.  How can any Minister justify this?  Language support teachers have been hit, so to speak, and some principals told me they may not be able to open their schools next January because of the substitution decision.  If a teacher rings in sick on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning, the principal may not have anyone to cover his or her class.  This is bad enough in primary schools where one can divide up the children, but at second level, where there are specialist classes, it is not so easy.  It will cause chaos in schools.  Principals are already stressed and this measure will make circumstances infinitely worse.  It is a direct attack on the education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_2010">The Minister for Education and Science has been praised for the steadfast manner in which he defended the education cuts, as if this were some kind of virtue.  This would be fine if there were positive and beneficial education cuts.  They are the opposite.  The Minister is defending education cuts which are damaging, negative and detrimental and he should not be praised by anybody for that.  I challenge people to examine the implementation and effects of these cuts.  They will cause a great amount of harm.</p>
          <p eId="para_2011">I wish to move to other issues.  The Disability Federation contacted my party and I know it has contacted other Deputies.  It is concerned about the reduction in its budget and maintains that a 1% cut in funding to disability services comes in addition to a 1% cut imposed by the Health Service Executive this year after efficiency savings were made.  We see again that people with disabilities are affected and are hit.  I already alluded to the attempt by the Government to make changes in the disability allowance.  That was rowed back under pressure.  Fine Gael was about to put forward a motion on the issue in the House and it is probable that the Government got wind of this and changed its strategy at the 11th hour.  It did the right thing there by making the change but did the wrong thing by introducing it in the first place.  I worry about the mindset of people who saw this and tried to change it.</p>
          <p eId="para_2012">There are also issues concerning the national disability strategy, the funding for it and where the funding goes.  There does not appear to be any mechanism of tracking that funding in order to make sure it ends up where it is supposed to.  That is something we must examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_2013">A number of years ago, when he was Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey piloted the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, a major part of national disability strategy, through this House.  We were promised it would be completed by 2010.  The Act dealt with education for persons with special educational needs and children with disabilities in the classroom but yet again this Government, which lauds itself for protecting the vulnerable, has decided to cut funding.  It left in place all its Ministers of State but decided to attack children with disabilities in the classroom.  As if they did not have enough to worry about, parents across the country are now worried about this.  The Act was progressive legislation at the time and I am disappointed the Government has decided to attack it and to stop funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_2014">Another relevant matter is the decision by Government to subsume the Combat Poverty agency into the Office of Social Inclusion.  I disagree fundamentally with this.  I know there have been a number of reports on the agency's future and perhaps we should do something with it.  However, perhaps it would be better if Combat Poverty were to be subsumed into the National Economic and Social Development Office where it might still put forward an independent critique of poverty in this country.  Now more than ever we need an independent voice that can research and report on the extent and effect of poverty on people.  My fear is that if Combat Poverty is taken under the Office of Social Inclusion it will disappear.  We would then no longer have an independent voice to report scientifically on poverty and that would be a retrograde step because all governments should have such a voice.  I put it to the Government that this action will get rid of that voice.</p>
          <p eId="para_2015">We must examine the attack made on the budget for youth affairs which is of particular interest to me.  The grant-in-aid for general expenses for youth organisations has been cut by 10%.  It is part-funded by the national lottery and has been cut at a time when we must support young people in the communities out of school.  If we cut that budget youth clubs and organisations and youth cafes will all be hit.  There have been reports in the past few days about the drug issue in the country and how serious it is.  The drugs initiative and young people facilities and services fund has also been cut, by 5%.  Instead of adding to these funds and investing in the future, in youth and education, we are to cut back on them, in particular on these organisations which are already run on a shoestring and can barely survive.  Any cut, even a small one, can have a considerable impact.  I ask the Government to take a look at this and bring forward a proper policy on youth issues.  It does not have one although it has a Minister of State for youth affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2016">My final point concerns decentralisation, another example of something that was cobbled together at the last minute on the back of an envelope.  In Youghal in County Cork decentralisation was ready to roll but has been stopped.  Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned agriculture and there have been many debates in the House with Deputy Creed and others on the impact of the budget on agriculture.  Young people have again been hit by the cut in installation aid and this has turned them away from agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_2017">Overall, not been much thought was given to this budget.  I hope a debate in the House will inform Ministers, officials and others and perhaps encourage them to look at issues again.  This should have been done initially, as I suggested last July.  We should have had a proper debate when we knew things were going wrong but the Government could not wait to get out of the gap last July.  It waited and waited and I am afraid the horse has bolted.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_2018">Though I do not agree with the saying, politics is often all about perception.  In budget 2009 the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, wanted to create the perception that they were in control and were in possession of the wisdom to guide Irish society and this economy through the current turmoil and position us correctly for the future.  The Minister concluded his budget speech with a call for patriotic action and asserted that we were all in this together.  As is customary, he received a standing ovation from the opposite side of this House but that ovation rather quickly turned into something else.  There is a very short distance between a pat on the back and a kick on the backside.</p>
          <p eId="para_2019">I always become suspicious when I hear somebody invoking patriotism.  It brings to mind the words of Samuel Johnson who said that patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.  We are now at the last refuge stage for a Government that has been reckless in its stewardship of the economy.  The first draft of history seems to indicate that this Government has blown the greatest opportunity the country has ever had to establish its mature economic identity around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_2020">It is the sheer hypocrisy of this budget that I find galling.  We may take some of the measures in agriculture as an example.  In disadvantaged areas 40,000 farmers will lose over €1,000 per year.  This cut is a direct attack on rural communities on the west coast and attacks farmers in my constituency in County Clare, where 6,120 will be directly affected.  The disadvantaged area payment was introduced to give farmers some respite because the land they farm is poor.  It is much harder to make a living from it.  The application of the 1% income levy on gross income for farmers and the self-employed is unfair and goes against all principles of a fair and equitable tax system.  The suspension of installation aid for young farmers and the early retirement scheme from midnight on the day budget 2009 was presented places the future of farming in jeopardy.  The farming sector is being hit disproportionately in this budget.  Hitting farmers by amounts in excess of €2,000 is simply not right.  The measures are unfair, unjust and clearly need to be revisited.  I appeal to the Minister to think again about the harshness of suspending the young farmers' installation aid scheme, the early retirement scheme and the disadvantaged area payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_2021">The throngs of pensioners who came to Dublin from the four corners of Ireland illustrated forcefully that the Government got it wrong when it removed the automatic right to a medical card for those over 70 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_2022">This budget is a missed opportunity to bring about real public service reform.  It has hit the old, the sick, the disabled and the young, the most vulnerable sectors of our society.  By hitting these groups and by omitting to bring about any serious public sector reform the Minister for Finance ignored the real underlying problem with this country's finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_2023">The 32 cuts proposed in the budget for education have a slash and burn feel about them and will have a devastating effect on every student.  The class size issue was a central part of the 2007 Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  That Ireland is consistently near the bottom of OECD leagues on this issue should be a source of shame and embarrassment to the Government.  The lack of investment in education in recent years has resulted in Ireland having the second largest class sizes in Europe.  With these cuts, Ireland will be placed bottom of the OECD league — so much for the concept of developing a knowledge-based economy.  These savage cuts will place our four and five year olds at a disadvantage in the early years of their education.  How are these children supposed to attain their full potential in overcrowded, dilapidated classrooms?  Ennis national school in County Clare is a prime example of this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_2024">I object to the fact that schools in County Clare will lose many teachers.  In Ennis, for example, St. Flannan's College, of which I am a past pupil, will lose five teachers, Coláiste Muire will lose four teachers and Ennis national school will lose five teachers, consisting of two mainstream teachers, two English support teachers and one Traveller support teacher.  Other primary schools such as Tulla national school and Tumgraney national school will not receive the vital additional teacher they dearly need.  Every school in County Clare will be affected and students will suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_2025">The €2 and €10 travel tax is ill-considered in its application.  In the context of Shannon Airport in my constituency of Clare, it undermines the principle of having a proper and balanced approach to regional development.  The tax sends out the wrong message and undermines this Government's supposed commitment to the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2026">Shannon Airport has been kicked repeatedly by the Fianna Fáil Party for the past two years.  The loss of the Shannon to Heathrow route has been followed by the proposed shedding of 280 jobs in Aer Lingus.  The Government claims it is not able to intervene in Aer Lingus affairs and cannot answer the fundamental question as to the reason it holds a 25% shareholding in the company but is unable to influence its direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_2027">With the introduction of a new travel tax, the Minister for Finance, in his wisdom, is trying to tax the airline industry out of recession.  Why is the Fianna Fáil-led Government hitting Shannon Airport hardest?  Why will a tax of only €2 apply to flights from Dublin Airport to Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and East Midlands airports while a €10 tax will apply to flights from Shannon to all these destinations?</p>
          <p eId="para_2028">In recent days, Ryanair has indicated that its €400 million investment in Shannon Airport is in jeopardy.  The company accounts for 60% of traffic in Shannon Airport, flying to 35 different routes and accommodating almost 2 million passengers, with an average fare of €10 per flight in the winter months.  At the stroke of a pen the Minister has imposed on passengers a tax which will increase the cost of flights by 100%.  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled on this matter, he acknowledged that no analysis was carried out on how a travel tax would impact on the tourism and business sectors before the measure was introduced.  He then justified its introduction on the basis that three other European Union countries have a similar tax in place.  This is a short-sighted approach because Ireland is an island nation whose economy is dependent on air travel.</p>
          <p eId="para_2029">The Minister's travel tax is anti-tourism and anti-business and will result in further job losses in my region.  The outrageous measure must not be introduced and I demand again that the Minister for Finance and the Fianna Fáil-led Government urgently scrap it as it will have a devastating effect on Shannon Airport and the mid-west.</p>
          <p eId="para_2030">As I stated, politics, unfortunately, is about perception.  This Government, with its enslavement to spin and public relations, has forgotten that ultimately politics is about people.  With this budget, it has forgotten about people, sidestepped and refused to tackle the real difficulties and, contrary to what the Minister said, failed to spread the burden.  This is not a surprise because gross mismanagement of the public finances by successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments has put us in this position in which we find ourselves.  The parties on the benches opposite will not chart a course out of it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_656">
          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_2031">The 2009 budget was conceived at a wild party held in a Fianna Fáil fuelled building boom and has been delivered prematurely in a welter of panic and confusion.  As we approach the 12th successive year of Fianna Fáil-led Government, we are experiencing a game of "back to the future".  However, one cannot blame somebody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_2032">In the cold light of a new reality, the Fianna Fáil-led Government has reached for the first available excuse by arguing that our economic problems are not its fault but a result of global economic turmoil.  The worldwide downturn is not the root cause of the disastrous deterioration in Government finances, which was well in progress before the failure of Lehman Brothers in mid-September caused global credit facilities to cease functioning, thus triggering a global banking crisis.  The banking crisis will add additional burdens to the Government's budget difficulties and make any recovery in Government finances even more difficult.  I am concerned about the equity of banks and the survival of small companies.  If the economy is to grow again, we must create jobs in small companies and businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_2033">I will make one general point about the global banking crisis.  The crisis arises directly from the fact that rewards in society have not been distributed fairly over many years.  Serious income inequalities have arisen both in the United States and Europe and particularly in this State since the 1980s, and these widening differences favoured the financial sector.  The mismanagement evident in this sector, including reckless lending practices, is a matter of grave concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_2034">The previous Taoiseach often spoke of his interest in Robert Putnam's ideas of social capital and his concern to ensure that we have an accumulation of social capital in Irish society.  Perhaps the current Taoiseach will concern himself more with the preservation of the financial assets of citizens.  In the broad sweep of history, James Burnham's forecast of the management revolution has now come to pass.  While this author and socialist commentator was wrong on many issues, he was at least close to being right in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_2035">In the past decade, a new financial executive management emerged and shareholders effectively lost control of their money.  The executive managers of the financial institutions, in their intense greed and desire for the wealth of ordinary citizens, devoured the wealth of the owners of capital and each other.  The effective power of shareholders vanished as executive management lined its own pockets.</p>
          <p eId="para_2036">The problems in the global economy, particularly inequalities in income, have implications for future policy making in every country.  Executive management must behave in a way that promotes fairness in society as a whole so as to properly serve the longer-term interests of its shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_2037">The Taoiseach will have difficulty convincing the electorate that the economic situation facing the country is the worst in the past 100 years when he has not yet convinced his Cabinet colleagues that this is the case.  Every day one sees Ministers make announcements and pronouncements on issues on television.  The reason the Taoiseach and his Cabinet have difficulty facing up to the true scale of the crisis in Government finances is that the current crisis is the direct result of years of Fianna Fáil disinterest and incompetence.  The Fianna Fáil Party has been in power for 12 years.  In the United States, a mood for change has resulted in an historic decision.  Here, too, we have a strong mood for change.  The United States has experienced eight years of President Bush but Ireland has had 12 years of a Fianna Fáil-led Government which lost its way several years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_2038">People are tired.  The Government became ever more incompetent as each year in office elapsed.  It has been in power for so long that it has become complacent, lost touch and become ineffective.  This incompetence violates the expectation of citizens for good government and diminishes their esteem of all politicians.  It is well documented by a range of Government projects which resulted in poor value for taxpayers' money.  Each new demonstration of ineptitude shows that the problem is beyond politics and is one of plain, old-fashioned, honest incompetence.  This incompetence and indifference to waste means it is time for the Government to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_2039">On a more specific issue, the parameters of the budget are based on the view that the decline in consumer spending will be limited to the final quarter of 2008 and that, as global confidence recovers, Irish consumers will recover their spending habits and Government revenues will recover strongly in 2009.  I hope the Government is right but I do not believe it will happen.  The crisis in Government finances is recognised to the extent that some crude tax increases have been introduced, and even cruder cost cutting measures, into next year's budget.  The Government has tried to portray these cuts as precise surgical procedures, carefully targeted to the lowest priorities.  What has actually been done is crude, ineffective clubbing rather than clean surgery.  Cost cutting is a short-term tactical move and just buys some time, the panacea of a quick fix at a heavy human and social cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_2040">This cost cutting exercise is in fact the evidence that proves this Administration's incompetence as a Government.  In the real world of business, effective managers try to reduce the cost of carrying out the activity, while keeping the activity going.  This approach recognises that once an activity disappears, it is considerably more difficult to start it up again.  Only as a very last resort is the business line shut down.</p>
          <p eId="para_2041">What Fine Gael has proposed the best policy to control and reduce the costs of carrying on the existing business of Government.  Reducing the cost of the public sector wage bill is by far the best option in present circumstances.  Everyone stays in work, existing services can largely be maintained, and the drop in the standard of living will be temporary.  A Fine Gael-led Government following this policy can restore the trust of the people and show that the Government and its Ministers are persons of substance, in control of the country and able to bring direction, efficiency and cost effectiveness to the State's activities.  In terms of specific policy areas I would like to see more attention being given to the indigenous manufacturing sector.  From a small acorn the large oak grows, but there is no respect in this country for the business person who is creating a small number of jobs.  There is nothing for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_2042">A key factor driving economic growth is the presence in Ireland of many global high technology companies.  More than 80% of exports from the manufacturing and service sectors are produced by these companies.  Of more importance to national economic success is the indigenous sector, both manufacturing and services.  The manufacturing sector has made little progress in the past ten years with the number of jobs falling.  Medium and large indigenous industry is of central importance in industrial policy because of its degree of integration into the economy.  There is an urgent need to review the effectiveness of the instruments and incentives used in the development of the indigenous manufacturing sector in every village and town.</p>
          <p eId="para_2043">This sector must get renewed priority so that investing in productive capacity for solidly based growth becomes more rewarding than making quick profit through speculation in property.  We need a significant expansion in local start-ups and in indigenous companies, with renewed attention to the issue of linkages with multinational companies located here.  There is an urgent need to improve their long-term competitive advantage, not just by a short-sighted attack on labour costs but by increased research and development, an emphasis on superior design and product quality innovation and marketing.</p>
          <p eId="para_2044">This has been an appalling budget from an Administration nearly 12 years in Government, with all the hallmarks of massive incompetence.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the time to make these comments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_657">
          <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_2045">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget.  I should like to empathise with Deputy Joe Carey, as regards something he said.  He mentioned his <i>alma mater</i>, St. Flannan’s College, Ennis, as having lost teachers.  He also mentioned my former secondary school, Coláiste Mhuire, as having lost teachers and I extend my sympathy to County Clare on that basis.  However, I must now don my Dublin South-Central hat in relation to education.  One of the points made was that schools in DEIS areas were not to be affected.  I understand from the number of e-mails I have been receiving from schools, teachers and parents since the budget that is simply not the case.  While technically the DEIS schools are meant to be protected, they are losing supports such as book grants, Traveller support schemes and support for physics and chemistry in the secondary schools.  Wearing my scientist hat I am appalled to think money will be pulled from physics and chemistry.  We are preaching day in, day out the importance of science and technology for the future development of the country and one of the first areas to be hit is the support for physics and chemistry.  How, in all honesty, does the Minister expect there will be interest and commitment for difficult subjects such as physics and chemistry in secondary schools if the support grants are to be pulled from them?</p>
          <p eId="para_2046">The same is true in areas such as home economics, art, choirs and orchestra, those types of additional subjects one might say that help to provide a more rounded student as against the whole academic aspect of education, which is also, of course, very desirable.  However, when money is pulled from such areas one ends up with grind schools where it is the survival of the fittest and the only thing that matters is points.  One will find people looking at the lowest common denominator, picking five or six subjects or whatever the minimum requirement is to get the points for a place in college or whatever.  That is fine for those schools who can deal with that.  It is not fine where there is leaving certificate applied and vocational, very dependent on those other subjects which create some type of more general opportunity for students who are not academically inclined and towards whom we should have the very same degree of commitment.  The support has been pulled from the leaving certificate applied and vocational courses as well.  They have been particularly successful in many of the disadvantaged areas where the drop out rates are enormous in many schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_2047">If I have time later on, I shall come back to education again, but I want in particular to look at the impact of the budget on Government supports for the arts and sport.  This is an area that has not been mentioned at all.  It has been significantly sidelined in terms of commentary, despite the fact that support has been very significantly reduced.  This can only have a detrimental impact on the many small groups, clubs and organisations that rely on funding from the Arts Council or the Irish Sports Council.  The decisions taken in this area are particularly short-sighted, similar to cuts in other areas where Departments have targeted those most in need of funding, the smaller clubs, organisations and groups that receive funding from the Arts Council and the Irish Sports Council.  They are unable to raise the finances themselves and so are absolutely dependent on this type of support.</p>
          <p eId="para_2048">Total funding for the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is down 22%, more than one fifth.  This fact highlights Fianna Fáil's true commitment to arts, sport and tourism.  Arts and sport are fine to support in the good times.  They are a great place for the vanity projects or indeed, the white elephant, if I can remind the House of the dreaded Bertie Bowl.  However, when times are tough this is the area that tops the queue for the chop and takes the first hit.  The Government has no respect for the important and vital role these sectors play in the community.  The proposed national stadium has moved from Deputy Bertie Ahern's pie in the sky Bertie Bowl, with 80,000 seats and no public transport, to a national sports campus with a 25,000-seat stadium that was committed to in the agreed programme for Government in 2007.  This project has been placed on indefinite hold.  It has a grant of just over €4 million for 2009 and based on that amount of funding it seems highly unlikely there will be any significant progress in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_2049">The former Taoiseach was famously fond of the Robert Putnam book, <i>Bowling Alone</i>, which charted the collapse of the American community.  It is a very interesting book to consult in terms of what actually happened when the small sports clubs and the bridge club, for example, fell apart.  The former Taoiseach’s colleagues who remain in Government must be aware of the role arts and sports play in a community together — and in fostering community spirit.  I spoke yesterday to a residents association which was interested in developing its own local festival, the whole purpose of which was to generate a community spirit.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_2050">I thank the office of the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this issue, which is affecting a large number of people — many of them in my constituency — who are dependent on the availability of respite care in the excellent facility in Harold's Cross.  I should point out it is not the palliative care unit that is affected, but the community respite unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2051">The service provided is vital to the health and well-being of a large number of people, especially those in need of intensive physiotherapy.  The closure of the 45 beds will have a severe impact on the people who were dependent on the service being available to them later this year.  The service is to be closed for eight to ten weeks.  Not only the people in the front line, the patients, but also the families will be affected by the closure.  What the closure means is that the respite care that would normally have been available to patients will not be available for those eight weeks.  As a result the families will have to provide constant care for their family member.</p>
            <p eId="para_2052">Unfortunately, once again it is the most vulnerable who will suffer on account of the loss of this service over the next eight weeks.  Overall, up to 56 patients or 45 beds will be affected.  Many of these patients are in constant pain as the unit affected deals particularly with patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  These are the people who will be affected by the closure.  I have had a number of phone calls since the closure was announced, from individuals affected or their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_2053">These people have pointed out that the amount of money that is to be saved on account of the closure is less than €1 million.  This is a paltry saving in the eyes of those people who will lose out due to the closure.  I understand the saving relates in particular to the cost of drugs and that the hospice can no longer provide these.  It is also the case that this community unit must devote much of its time to fund raising.  Despite its best efforts, there is a limit to the amount it can raise voluntarily.  Therefore, it is dependent on HSE funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2054">The service provided by the hospice is specific and extraordinarily effective for its patients.  The outcome of the closure is that these patients will be left in limbo for the next eight weeks, while the hospice is endeavouring to ensure that the patients are provided with alternative placements.  Unfortunately, this does not look optimistic.  If it is the case that the patients could be accommodated in some other location, what is the point of moving them and closing this facility, since it would appear the shortfall has arisen because of the cost of drugs, not the bed spaces?</p>
            <p eId="para_2055">One lady to whom I spoke today told me how she depends on this service to give her some relief from her constant pain.  Only last week her condition was exacerbated by a bad fall, making it now very difficult for her to get around.  She had been looking forward to her two weeks respite care here, where she would be given excellent attention.  All those to whom I have spoken have been highly complimentary of the service and the staff in the unit.  The lady in question was shocked by the news that the service would not be available to her, particularly since she has had a fall that has made her condition even worse.  It is unlikely she will get an alternative place before Christmas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2056">I urge the Minister to ensure that the money needed to keep this service open is found within the budget of the HSE.  If necessary, the solution should be found through cuts in some area of the HSE service that does not affect frontline services.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryWallace" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_659">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Mary Wallace)</from>
            <p eId="para_2057">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it provides us with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government's commitment to services for older people generally and, in particular, to the important area of the management of existing services and associated funding.  I should advise the Deputy that the Health Service Executive has informed me that it is unaware of any proposal to close 60 respite beds at Harold's Cross.  It is understood that the current issue concerns, primarily, the rheumatology service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">While robust financial management systems are an essential feature of any health service, they are not an end in themselves.  Our primary focus has to be on patients.  Each hospital, each local health office, managers, clinicians and others working in the health services have a responsibility to ensure that they strive to provide the best possible service to patients and other clients of our health services, but within agreed budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2059">The HSE has committed, through the national service plan 2008, to delivering services within its Vote as provided by the Oireachtas.  Significant ongoing resources are provided by the HSE for the delivery of services by a range of statutory and voluntary care providers across the country on an annual basis.  This investment in services allows for the provision of a wide range of supports for palliative care patients, including specialist inpatient beds, home care teams, palliative supports in acute hospitals and day care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2060">Earlier this year, the executive allocated an overall budget of €33 million to Our Lady's Hospice.  The hospice was advised by the HSE that there would be no additional funding provided beyond the allocation.  At a meeting in April, the hospice was further advised of the requirement to deliver services within available funding and to submit a plan to this effect.  This was submitted in May.  The hospice continued to be advised by the executive over the following months of the need to achieve a break-even position.  This is no different from any other agency funded through the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_2061">At a recent meeting the executive requested that the hospice submit a revised break-even plan as it was not achieving its targets.  Our Lady's Hospice confirmed that there were a number of options to be considered by its board of management at a meeting last Wednesday in this context.  The HSE understood that when a decision was made by the board of management with regard to the break-even plan, it would be communicated to the executive for consideration.  The hospice announced on Friday, 31 October 2008 its intention to close 34 rheumatology rehabilitation beds and 11 community rehabilitation beds for a temporary period, with effect from mid-November, with a view to meeting budget overrun.</p>
            <p eId="para_2062">Our Lady's Hospice provides specialist care for people with a range of needs, from rehabilitation to end-of-life care.  Facilities and services include an extended care unit, a palliative care unit, a community re-ablement unit and rheumatology rehabilitation.  The rheumatology rehabilitation centre is a multi-disciplinary unit for the assessment and management of rheumatic diseases.  It is the only facility of its kind in Ireland and is linked to the rheumatology department at St. Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park.  The unit provides care and treatment for people of all ages with arthritis and other bone and muscle diseases.  Over 800 patients are admitted annually.  It provides medical, nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and radiology services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2063">It should be noted that the decision to issue a press statement, or the content matter of that statement, was not agreed with the HSE in advance.  The executive is working closely with the hospice to ensure that the infusion treatment currently being provided for rheumatology patients at Harold's Cross will continue to be provided.  The HSE is continuing to work with the hospice in order to achieve a break-even position at year end.  A further meeting between the executive and the hospice has been arranged for tomorrow, Thursday, 6 November 2008.</p>

          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_660">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_2064">Nine patients in the north east had a misdiagnosis of lung cancer, thus losing valuable time for their essential medical treatment.  At least one of these patients would have had a major chance of their cancer being cured.  Others had their lives shortened by a valuable period of months.  Eight of these patients have now, sadly, died.  There is, therefore, a need for an independent inquiry into why a clear warning, given seven years ago by a consultant radiologist in Navan, that the radiologists in the hospitals concerned were under intolerable stress, that a dangerous situation existed for patients and staff and that mistakes would be made, was ignored by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_2065">The inquiry began in 2007.  I have a letter dated 9 October, correspondence from Dr. John Kiely, regarding two missed diagnoses of serious lung pathology on radiographs.  The core issue is confirmation in this letter that there were significant abnormalities on two patients' radiographs that were reported as normal.  That appalling error had fatal consequences for eight of the nine people concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">How clear was the warning in 2001 and is there any way the HSE could say it was not adequate?  The letter stated that staffing in the Louth-Meath group was inadequate and, in Mr. Towers's considered opinion, a dangerous situation had arisen for staff and patients.  He warned that mistakes would be made by the situation created by the inability or reluctance of the HSE to appoint sufficient full-time permanent radiologists in Drogheda.  He wrote that the radiologists were under intolerable stress and the radiology service in Drogheda was deficient for proper patient care.  The unwillingness to fund proper staffing for radiology was at the core of the problem, according to Mr. Towers.  The intolerable workload meant that teaching, administration and other activities have had to be discontinued.  That description of the conditions obtaining in Our Lady of Lourdes and Navan hospitals was written seven years ago this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">In 2006, when Judge Maureen Harding Clark investigated the Neary affair, the same issues arose.  Her report clearly states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2068">The work of all doctors including highly regarded consultants has to be reviewed in an effective and dispassionate manner.  Failure to engage in effective peer review and independent audit will ensure that history will repeat itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">History has repeated itself in the Dr. Neary affair and again in the report published this week.  It is a shame and a disgrace.</p>
            <p eId="para_2070">I would like the Minister for Health and Children to answer six questions.  Can she confirm that the radiology department in the Louth-Meath group is now resourced with sufficient consultant radiologists and that the misdiagnosis of X-rays is no longer significant?  Can she confirm that no concern regarding the number of radiologists employed in the group has been brought to the attention of the HSE in the recent past?  Can she confirm that no concern regarding significant misdiagnosis of X-rays in the Louth-Meath hospital group has been expressed to the HSE since the locum consultant involved in the recent review left the region?  Does the radiology department continue to depend on locums, including external radiologists employed by the HSE to report on X-rays, due to the department's workload?  Has she been informed by the consultant radiologists that they are experiencing great difficulties in coping with the current workload of the three hospitals in the group?  Is she or the HSE taking action on the repeated representations made by consultants regarding the inability of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital to cope safely with the number of patients on trolleys?  On Monday, 3 November, for example, 34 patients were on trolleys in the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">We need a root and branch reform of administrative structures in the north east.  This review is a whitewash in terms of how and why these events took place.  It sets out the medical outcome for the eight people who died but it does not address the core issue of why the warnings given seven years ago this month were ignored.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryWallace" eId="spk_661" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_2072">Yesterday the Health Service Executive published the review of chest X-rays and CT scans reported by a locum consultant radiologist at Louth-Meath hospitals group from August 2006 to August 2007.  The review commenced in May 2008 and examined 6,000 X-rays and CT scans from 5,000 patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">The review found that nine patients in Drogheda and Navan hospitals had their diagnoses of lung cancer delayed as a result of missed radiological diagnoses.  Eight of these patients are now deceased and one is receiving ongoing treatment.  The review acknowledges that the delayed diagnosis had varying impacts on these patients' care and treatment options.  Along with my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, I extend my deepest sympathies to the families of the patients who suffered delays in their diagnoses of lung cancer.  These nine patients had been identified and diagnosed prior to March 2008.  The review therefore did not find any previously undiagnosed lung cancer.  The HSE and the radiologist whose work gave rise to this review have apologised to the families of the patients who were affected by these delayed diagnoses.  The review will be forwarded to the Medical Council of Ireland and the General Medical Council in the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">While I understand that concerns were raised in 2001 in regard to radiology services in the north east, services have been enhanced in the intervening period.  The HSE has confirmed that all radiology services in the Louth-Meath group are entirely consultant delivered.  In 2001, five consultant radiologists were employed in the group.  It is acknowledged that complexity and workload have increased in recent years and ten consultant radiologists currently work in the radiology departments of the hospitals in Drogheda, Navan and Dundalk.  All the consultant radiologists have joint appointments to two of the three hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">The importance of audit in a modern health care system is fully recognised and the HSE has informed the Department that peer reviews are conducted in the hospitals concerned.  The radiologists hold separate weekly clinical radiology meetings in all three hospitals in medicine, surgery and breast radiology and regularly participate in grand rounds in Drogheda and Navan.  Electronic conferencing is fully operational in Navan and is being developed in Drogheda.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">In response to the matters described in the review, HSE north east hospital network is adding to its existing patient safety measures by beginning an additional process to enhance clinical governance in the radiology services of the hospitals.  A good system of clinical governance in health care involves quality assurance systems aimed at reducing the likelihood of errors occurring and increasing the early detection of those errors which do occur.  This will cover the five hospitals in the north east and will produce an agreed programme to improve clinical governance and, therefore, patient safety and quality of care.  This process is underway and will result in an initial action plan in December to enhance the system and ethos of effective clinical governance in radiology services in the north east.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">In regard to locum appointments, Louth-Meath hospital group's radiology department has in recent years employed no more than one or two locum consultant radiologists at any one time, out of a complement of ten consultant radiologists.  This is due in part to the high degree of cross-cover provided among consultant colleagues in the hospital group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">The group's human resources department has in place a procedure for the recruitment of permanent staff and this is also used for the recruitment of temporary and locum consultant staff.  In the case of the locum consultant radiologist involved in this review, all normal recruitment procedures were followed.  Following an interview, registration with the Medical Council was confirmed and a reference was received from previous employers.  Therefore, it is not considered that any specific issue arose in respect of this consultant's recruitment or appointment.  However, given the overall requirement to provide assurance on the level and recruitment of locums in medical practice, the HSE issued national guidance in May 2008 which requires hospitals and facilities to accept locum medical staff only from medical recruitment agencies that meet a series of stringent requirements relating to the doctors they refer to the employers.  These include ensuring that the doctor has full references and full CV, is a member of the relevant Medical Council register and has been given full occupational health clearance and police screening.  Standards in recruitment and in levels of use of locum clinicians will continue to be reviewed and monitored by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">The HSE is committed to learning from this review and to driving change.  In partnership with its clinical staff, it will do all it can to enhance patient safety at all levels.</p>

            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_2082">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting for discussion the closing of Harristown House, the only public alcohol and drug treatment centre in the country funded by the probation service.  Harristown House was established in 1998 as a residential treatment centre for offenders with alcohol and-or drug-related offences.  It was originally supposed to take referrals from the courts only but in recent years has also taken referrals from the prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">The recent report of the probation service on Harristown House painted a picture of an institution with many problems but what must not be lost sight of is that this facility is badly needed in our modern life in this State.  It has given the residents who have completed the six week course a chance to overcome their addictions with alcohol or drugs.  The centre was run on a relatively small budget and, by helping to keep people out of prison, actually saved money in the long run.  The cost of keeping someone prisoner is somewhere in the region of €100,000 whereas the cost of this facility was €460,000 last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">The recent report of the probation service noted that the manager and some members of the staff did not co-operate with the report when it was being formulated.  Part of the reason for that was because the previous reports, the Paxis and Brannigan reports, which had been largely positive were not followed through nor were their recommendations implemented.  For example, one report indicated that 65% of residents did not reoffend after the course.  These reports recommended the provision of greater supports in respect of staffing levels and facilities.  If some of the recommendations of these reports had been implemented then many of the problems outlined in the most recent report may not have arisen.</p>
            <p eId="para_2085">The people affected by this closure are an extremely vulnerable sector of our society — all are addicted to alcohol or drugs, many left school early and have literacy and other learning difficulties, some have mental health issues, behavioural problems, poor employment records and prospects and some are estranged from their families.  Therefore they are left with no possible source of support if this closure is implemented.  Some 20 jobs are at stake and these people have not had a pay rise over the past number of years.  They are not paid excessively.</p>
            <p eId="para_2086">Six residents took part in the report and told of their experiences.  They said it was a good place but that it needed better facilities and that these facilities could be used as a reward for good behaviour.  This was a cry for help from residents and they should not be forgotten.  If it is to be closed, I ask that the problems be sorted out and that it be reopened as soon as possible.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_665">
            <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
            <p eId="para_2087">I support this initiative.  The Harristown treatment centre offered addiction treatment to young men who came through the courts and it treated up to 100 people per year.  Effectively, it gave young people another chance.  The commitment of the staff was impressive and I appreciate that the report has been completed.  Although it has closed, we hope that the facility will reopen immediately.</p>

            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_2088">I thank Deputy O'Mahony for sharing time.  Not only is it important that the service is re-established as quickly as possible to avoid the need for more expensive prison places and to provide the opportunity to avail of this valuable service to young people, it is imperative that the skill set and knowledge built up over the past ten years in the staffing pool is not lost to any new service.  While discussions have focused on the lack of specific skills of the voluntary management committee, it is evident that there was no difficulty with the present structure while the probation service took an active role in the management of the facility until June 2004.  It was unfair on the voluntary committee, the staff and the management of the facility for the probation service to take a step back from such an active role.  It is now essential that the probation service step up to the mark to secure the long-term future of Harristown House and its staffing complement.  It is clear from recommendations in the report that the independent review body believes that this service needs to be re-established and reinstated as soon as possible.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryWallace" eId="spk_667" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Mary Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_2089">In dealing with this Adjournment matter the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has asked me to put his funding commitment to community-based projects at the centre of the debate.  It has been said that the planned closure of Harristown House is linked to monetary issues alone.  I, on behalf of the Minister, want to categorically reject that assertion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">The Minister's first priority is to ensure that his Department funds projects in the community that will add to the core work of the probation service and help its clients to better equip them for a life free from the crime patterns in which they have found themselves.  To that end, significant funding has been provided in the past number of years, up from approximately €16 million in 2004 to over €21.5 million last year.  This is a very significant financial commitment and represents 36% of the overall annual expenditure budget of the probation service for 2007.  That fact speaks for itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">The Minister is committed to continuing to fund such projects, thus providing more effective and efficient supports for clients of the probation service.  Included in the funding provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, through the probation service, is money to help run three adult residential facilities catering for ex-offenders and the Harristown Residential Alcohol and Drug Treatment Centre.  In association with the probation service, the Department commissioned a review of adult probation residential facilities in order to examine, <i>inter alia</i>, the management structure, overall governance and operation of these residential facilities and the role of the probation service.  In addition, the review included an examination of the efficiency, effectiveness and value achieved from the funding.  The report was completed at the end of July 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">Harristown House, located in the grounds of Castlerea Prison, County Roscommon formed part of the review and management; staff and clients all had an opportunity to feed in their views.  As is normal practice, following the completion of the work a copy of the final report was made available by the probation service in September to each of the four facilities reviewed and each board of management was asked to examine the findings and the required actions needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">The Harristown House project was established in 1998 and has been providing a short-term residential facility for persistent male offenders over 18 years of age, appearing before the court where alcohol is seen as a contributory factor in their behaviour.  Harristown House has capacity for 12 residents at any given point in time.  However, the house has never operated at full capacity.  The maximum number of residents present at any point in time is usually eight but this can vary a little.  The statistics for admissions to the house in the years 2005-07 show that there were 66 admitted in 2005, rising to 76 in 2006 and dropping back to 69 admissions in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">The primary aim of the project has been to educate the participant on the effects of alcohol and drugs to enable them to become more law abiding.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the sole funder of the project and has approved and provided current funding of €460,000 to the facility in 2008, by way of quarterly grants.  In April of this year, the Department provided an additional €100,000 to clear a deficit incurred by the project.  The project is operated by a board of management consisting of 12 volunteer members including a representative of the probation service and employs 22 people, eight in a full-time capacity and 14 part-time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2095">The report on the residential facilities provides the probation service and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a very valuable blueprint of how the four facilities are currently operating.  The findings in respect of Harristown House give cause for concern and the continuation of the project in its current format is not feasible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">The overall conclusion of the report was that the centre is in crisis.  There are serious indications in respect of human resources, finance and quality of service that the organisation has become dysfunctional.  The results of this review indicate that the organisation is no longer viable.  It would be remiss of any Minister to sweep away such concerns.  While the probation service provides funds for the centre, the centre itself is a limited company controlled by its own board of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">The board, by letter to the director of the probation service, dated 7 October 2008, advised that it was the unanimous view of the board that the facility should be closed.  In that letter the chairman of the board stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2098">Unfortunately, the Board of Management has been frustrated in attempting to resolve a growing range of serious difficulties which have emerged relating to the operation and management of this valuable facility.  These difficulties have included the effective programme and facility management, limited programme participation levels, the absence of clarity and focus in programme direction and purpose and the funding difficulties arising as problems have remained unresolved.  The Board of Management of Harristown House shares the concern outlined in the review that the facility is not fulfilling its stated aims and objectives.[...] It was the unanimous view of the Board that Option 2 of the Review Report is our preferred course of action, i.e. close down the facility, take time to reflect on the learning and develop a vision and plan for a new way forward for Harristown House.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">The Minister and his Department share the concerns contained in the report and expressed by the board.  In any event, the Minister does not have the power to overturn the decision of the board of management.   The probation service will now work with the board of management to bring about an orderly closure of the project in its present form.  The board has made its decision and it is the best decision in the circumstances.  I want to place on the record the Minister's deep appreciation, and that of his Department and the probation service, of the work done by the board of management and its staff since the project opened its doors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">Further to the board's decision to close Harristown and following a request from the trade union IMPACT, a representative of the board met union officials and staff members on Tuesday, 28 October 2008 to discuss the proposed closure.  The director of the probation service was present at that meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">The Minister is committed to finding the best option available to meet the addiction needs of the client group of the probation service.  Funding will not be an issue.  The current report, combined with other reports on this facility, gives a good basis upon which to make informed decisions that will ultimately lead to a better, more focused and tailored service to this particular client group.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the probation service are committed to working to achieve a viable alternative that will bring added value to the work of the service and, most importantly, better meet the range of needs of individual clients with addiction and other issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">The probation service will now set about developing a detailed new vision for the Harristown House concept, including identifying the needs for addiction treatment places in this catchments area, seeking to develop sustainable partnerships to deliver the identified services.  I reiterate that this is not a simple money exercise.  It is a strategic review of services to a specific client group with particular needs so that the State can provide the most appropriate service to that grouping.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_2104">I hope the Deputy will agree that the State must at all times be mindful of the type and range of services we provide to key groupings, such as those with addiction issues.  We must be willing to look critically at how we are providing those service and be prepared to examine, evaluate and if necessary start afresh in the knowledge that the service will be better able to meet the many complex needs which are part and parcel of our population.</p>
            <p eId="para_2105">Funding has been and will continue to be provided to projects which support the work of the probation service.  This money will be provided based on the needs of the client group and on the understanding that the necessary experience and expertise is available to deliver the service so required. That is no more than the taxpayer expects from us.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_668">
            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_2106">Hallowe'en, a traditional time for religious commemoration, being the eve of the feast of All Saints, has become an occasion for serious anti-social behaviour.  In my constituency of Dublin Central a factory was burnt in the docklands and a restaurant in Phibsboro in suspicious circumstances which suggest arson.  A fire brigade was stoned while dealing with a bonfire in Sheriff Street and a fireman was injured in the eye.  Some 12 men were arrested and two gardaí had their noses broken on Dorset Street.  Rioting occurred in O'Devaney Gardens.  Some gardaí were effectively imprisoned for some time and a number of unoccupied flats were set on fire.  The Dublin Fire Service was called out to 800 incidents in the city and the ambulance service received 500 calls.</p>
            <p eId="para_2107">The clean up bill alone is estimated to cost more than €1 million to the taxpayer.  Property damage would run into further millions.  The bonfires in the green areas of estates have caused an ugly scar which, as the Acting Chairman will know, remains there throughout the year until next Hallowe'en.  All this happened despite a co-ordinated attempt by the Garda and the local authority to seize tyres and pallets from youths who were hoarding them.  Approximately 100 tonnes were seized in Dublin city and in one rear garden alone in Sheriff Street approximately 250 tyres, some large tractor tyres, were seized by the city council in the run-up to Hallowe'en.</p>
            <p eId="para_2108">It seems that the current policy is not working.  I tabled a question two weeks prior to Hallowe'en asking the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform what he proposed to do this year.  Operation Tombola was put in action again, with all the levels of consultation, liaison, seizures and so on, but clearly it is not effective.  We need to put together a more comprehensive, co-ordinated plan to deal with the Hallowe'en mayhem that now is occurring not only in Dublin but throughout the country.  There is almost a mindset among the youth of the country that Hallowe'en is an opportunity for violence and anti-social behaviour, that anything goes and that the authorities can be attacked at will.</p>
            <p eId="para_2109">Solutions must be found concerning the matter of fireworks.  Fireworks are legal in Northern Ireland, while they are illegal in the Republic.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform — as I have said to successive Ministers over the years — must agree a set of proposals with his counterpart in Northern Ireland.  He should try to synchronise the legislation between the two parts of the island.  It is not rocket science.  If fireworks can be sold legally in one part of the island and not in the other part, they will be sold, smuggled or brought across the Border.  It is a simple matter of trying to deal with that by way of some cross-Border co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">It is time to prosecute those business people who do not recycle pallets and tyres as they are obliged to do by law.  As a result, they are "stolen" by youths for bonfires so that they do not have to pay the cost of recycling.  The cost of recycling a standard car tyre is €4 or €5 and they are supposed to be dealt with properly.  However, they are made available by the garages and the various businesses that deal with them.  That also applies to pallets, wood and so on.  Hallowe'en is a clean up time for businesses which do not want to pay the cost of recycling.  Rather than seizing those goods that have been hoarded by youths, the way to stop such practice is to ensure the emphasis is put on prosecuting those who are making such goods available to these young people in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2111">It is unacceptable that the emergency services personnel become targets for assault while providing emergency services to the community.  Such behaviour must be severely sanctioned.  In this respect, it is very important that parents play their proper role in ensuring that their children are not involved in late night activities and anti-social behaviour at Hallowe'en.</p>
            <p eId="para_2112">In terms of the sale of the alcohol to minors, there is no doubt that there is no other time in the year younger children are to be found drinking alcohol throughout the city.  Children as young as 12, 13 and 14 years of age have cans of alcohol.  Clearly, such alcohol is being made available.  On Hallowe'en eve I saw youngsters who were clearly under age carrying packs and bags of alcohol from a particular supermarket.  This problem requires good Garda policing to ensure it is addressed.  What is needed is a mechanism to identify the venues from which such alcohol is sold when it is to be found in the hands of minors.  We need a labelling mechanism to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_2113">While the local authority and the Garda are to complimented on what they have done in terms of activities were for the pre-teenagers, there was nothing available for the post-teenagers or for the teenager themselves.  That area must be looked at.  We need a comprehensive programme to deal with this matter for the coming year.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Wallace</from>
            <p eId="para_2114">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regrets that he cannot be present due to other business, but he assures the Deputy that he shares his concerns and those of all right thinking people about anti-social and unlawful behaviour at Hallowe'en and at any other time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">The overwhelming majority of people celebrated an enjoyable and peaceful Hallowe'en. However, a small minority engaged in behaviour which was anti-social and criminal and caused injury and danger to others and wanton damage to property, as described by the Deputy.  In particular, I condemn the attacks on members of the emergency services who were performing their duty and wish those injured a speedy recovery.  Since the Criminal Justice Act 2006, such behaviour is punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment or a fine or both.</p>
            <p eId="para_2116">The Garda authorities take proactive steps to combat anti-social and criminal behaviour around Hallowe'en by putting Operation Tombola in place, as the Deputy mentioned.  A few weeks ago the Minister spoke with the Garda Commissioner about intensifying the campaign this year.   Operational orders were put in place in every Garda region, in particular in the Dublin metropolitan region and Border divisions, to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks in the lead up to Hallowe'en and to police the Hallowe'en period.  The penalties for these offences have been significantly increased.  Proactive policing arrangements were in place which covered the period up to and including the night of 31 October.  Additional patrols were carried out by uniform personnel as part of high-visibility policing initiatives, supported by plain-clothes personnel, including district detective and drug units, divisional crime task forces, traffic corps personnel, community policing and mountain bike units.</p>
            <p eId="para_2117">The Garda Síochána also engaged with local communities, local authorities and other stakeholders, such as Dublin Bus, in putting in place plans to address the issues that arise around the Hallowe'en period.  They also put in place liaison arrangements for the removal of identified stockpiles of combustible materials.  Through the schools programme and other local programmes, members of the Garda Síochána publicised the message that fireworks are illegal and highlighted the dangers associated with illegally imported fireworks.  The Garda also advised managers of off-licences to ensure their staff were made aware of their obligations under licensing legislation relating to the sale of alcohol, in particular to under age persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2118">Members of the Garda Síochána from local community policing units were instructed to liaise with local authorities and local residents to ensure that any information received regarding bonfires and other anti-social behaviour was acted upon in advance of Hallowe'en.  During this period additional public order patrols were also directed to pay particular attention to areas where anti-social behaviour and drinking in public might occur.</p>
            <p eId="para_2119">Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  Furthermore, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order.  In addition, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_2120">The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 gives further powers to the Garda to tackle misuse of alcohol, which is too often at the root of crime and anti-social behaviour.  Gardaí now have the power to seize alcohol in the possession of an under 18 year old which they suspect is for consumption in a public place.  They can also seize alcohol where they reasonably believe there is the danger of public disorder or damage to property and require the person to leave the place.  They also now have the power to issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place.  These notices will lead to a more efficient and effective use of Garda resources and avoid court proceedings where an offender pays the penalty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2121">In recent years the expansion in the size of the Garda Síochána has been unprecedented.  From the start of this year to the end of 2009, the attested strength of the force will have grown by more than 1,100 to almost 14,900.  This will represent an 8% increase.  The additional rostered hours available next year arising from the increase in the strength of the force will amount to more than 1 million hours.  This will more than offset the planned reduction in overtime hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">The Minister strongly believes that the joint policing committees set up under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 will play a significant role in tackling anti-social and criminal behaviour.  On 24 September, along with his colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, he launched the roll-out of the committees to all local authorities where a committee is not already established under the initial pilot phase.  Over time, the committees will make an enormous contribution to keeping our communities safe, since they represent a partnership between the people, through their elected representatives, and the Garda Síochána in preventing and tackling crime and anti-social behaviour.</p>

            <p eId="para_2124">Following discussions in early October between officials from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the United States Government, the DPRK's reversal during the summer of its agreed nuclear disablement process appears to have been resolved. As a result, inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) returned last month to the nuclear facilities in the DPRK, and work towards the decommissioning of these sites has now resumed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">In the wider context, the humanitarian situation in the DPRK remains of considerable concern. The country is suffering chronic food insecurity and high malnutrition rates, and remains reliant on external food assistance to meet the needs of its 23 million people. Recent studies indicate that the DPRK has been as vulnerable to the global crisis as other countries, with domestic costs increasing in line with global food prices, and the price of fuel surging by 50 percent in the second quarter of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">The situation in the DPRK was discussed at the ASEM 7 Summit on 25 October, in the context of a broad review of international and regional developments. The official record of the Summit noted that the ASEM Leaders had welcomed the progress made in the recent Six-Party Talks discussions and "called on the relevant parties to continue to take positive steps to move forward the Six-Party Talks with the aim of early and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful manner." They also emphasized the importance of addressing the humanitarian concerns in the DPRK.</p>

            <p eId="para_2129">Ireland's development aid Programme Countries are some of the poorest in the world. In recent years many of them have demonstrated slow but steady progress, both economically and socially. This progress, despite enormous and continuing challenges, is the result of new and stronger partnerships between international donors, such as Ireland, and developing country governments. These partnerships are driven by the overall objective of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. These Goals set specific targets for the reduction of poverty by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_2130">I am concerned that the global credit crisis may undermine international commitments to provide resources to meet the Millennium Development Goals and thus set back efforts to help the poorest of the poor, including those in Ireland's Programme Countries. I am equally concerned at the effect of the rise in the price of food and the lingering effects of recent oil price fluctuations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2131">To overcome the effects of the global credit crisis in our Programme Countries we will continue to focus on what has been shown to work. Our aim is poverty reduction through building the capacity to deliver basic services, encouraging policies to foster equitable economic growth, building the institutions of good governance and working with other donors and developing country governments to ensure commitments are met and that resources are well managed and give value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_2132">We will also adapt our aid programmes in specific countries to meet local and national needs in the light of the credit crisis. For example, in Malawi, we are orienting our programme to meet the needs of rural people through interventions in the areas of agriculture and food security. This is an example of Ireland's flexibility in relation to our aid programme. We will continue to work closely with our Programme Country partner governments to meet emerging needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2133">The global credit crisis must not allow the Millennium Development Goals to lose their centrality in the international agenda. They remain very central to our aid objectives. In 2008, I expect ODA expenditure to amount to 0.54% of GNP. We are the world's sixth most generous aid donor in terms of GNP. This demonstrates Ireland's commitment to play our part in progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.</p>

            <p eId="para_2135">The UN World Summit held in September 2005 agreed a package of UN reforms which, while not as complete as might have been hoped, represented an important advance. Work to implement these reforms has been proceeding since then on a number of levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2136">As part of this reform, Ireland has been playing a leading role in the effort to reform the mechanisms through which the UN provides assistance to the developing world. The basis for this reform is the recommendations of the High Level Panel on System-wide Coherence. Essentially, these are proposals to improve the UN's internal coherence and its delivery of development assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">The Panel reported in late 2006 and its proposals mainly centre on the development of a unified UN presence at country level, i.e. that all UN agencies in a country would operate from a single office, with one leader, one programme and one budget. The core objective is to improve the delivery of aid by the UN in developing countries. Since the publication of the Panel report, pilot programmes have been established in eight countries, including in three Irish Aid priority countries — Vietnam, Tanzania and Mozambique.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">The Irish Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, Ambassador Paul Kavanagh, together with the Tanzanian Permanent Representative, was appointed in January 2008 by the former President of the General Assembly to lead consideration of the recommendations of the Panel. They submitted a joint Co-Chairs' report to the President of the General Assembly in July 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2139">On 15 September 2008, the General Assembly adopted by consensus a Resolution on "System-wide Coherence" which welcomed the Co-Chairs' report and agreed to move forward on the four priority areas identified in their report:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2140">(i) ‘Delivering as One' at country level, with the related aspect of Harmonisation of Business Practices; (ii) Funding; (iii) Governance; and (iv) Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">As regards reform of the Security Council, Ireland's view is that a more representative, efficient and transparent Security Council is an essential aspect of reforming the UN to meet the many global challenges which we face.</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">Following extensive consultations, the previous President of the General Assembly brokered a deal on 15 September this year, which provides for intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council reform to commence at an informal plenary of the General Assembly. On 13 October, the President of the General Assembly announced that these negotiations will begin on 21 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">I believe that the decision to set a date for opening of intergovernmental negotiations represents genuine progress on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">Discussions are also continuing on the important issue of management reform. Despite progress in a number of areas, there remains much more to be done, particularly in relation to planning and budgetary processes and human resources management.</p>

            <p eId="para_2148">In terms of specific diplomatic demarches to other Governments, in March this year, following security measures directed at monks and other protestors in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, the Department of Foreign Affairs conveyed the Government's very serious concerns regarding the situation there, including the use of force and treatment of detainees, to the Chinese Embassy in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">In April and May this year, our Embassies throughout Africa carried out ten urgent démarches on behalf of the Government to relay our strong concerns nationally regarding the situation in Zimbabwe. These démarches expressed our alarm about the serious violence and intimidation being carried out against the Movement for Democratic Change and other opposition supporters, as well as the political impasse in the country. They also registered our dismay in relation to the failure to issue final results of the presidential elections more than a month after the event.</p>

These 2007 commitments are for the EU to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020, and to consume 20% of total energy from renewable sources and 10% of transport fuel from biofuels by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">The Taoiseach at the European Council made clear Ireland's continued support for these objectives.

            <p eId="para_2159">Under the Government's decentralisation programme announced in 2003, 125 posts attached to the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs were to decentralise to Limerick. The Division is the Headquarters of Irish Aid. Following sanction of an additional 20 posts by the Department of Finance in 2005, the total number of posts attached to Irish Aid Headquarters increased to 145. Of these, 138 are transferring to Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">The total travel budget for Irish Aid in 2008 is €3.05 million. There is no specific allocation for travel costs related to decentralisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">Of the 108 staff assigned to Irish Aid at the time decentralisation was announced, 14%, or 15 officials, were transferred to other areas of the Department or to other Departments as a direct result of decentralisation. It is in the nature of the work of the Department that staff transfer between Divisions at HQ, and indeed to Embassies abroad, on a regular basis. This routine rotation accounts for the balance of the staff transfers from Irish Aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">As the decentralisation of Irish Aid did not result in any increase in the total sanctioned number of staff for the Department, there were no additional staffing costs in 2008 and none are anticipated for 2009. The number of staff joining the Department in order to decentralise to Limerick was balanced by the number leaving through retirement, promotion or transfer to other Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">The decentralisation of Irish Aid Headquarters has not been postponed due to budgetary considerations. The move to Limerick will be completed next week, when staff move into a new headquarters building.</p>

         the position in political and humanitarian terms as pertains in Zimbabwe; and the prospects of power sharing structures emerging.

      </p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_676">
            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2165">More than six weeks after the signing of a power-sharing agreement between Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party, and the Tsvangirai and Mutambara factions of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), there has still been no agreement on forming a Government, and the situation in Zimbabwe remains deeply worrying. Although political violence has diminished, it has not stopped. The rate of inflation has now reached unimaginable levels. As the Zimbabwe dollar has lost credibility and value Zimbabweans increasingly have to use foreign currencies, principally the US dollar and the South African rand, for transactions such as grocery purchases, property sales and rentals, legal fees and fuel sales. The World Food Programme estimates that 5.1 million people will require food assistance by January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2166">The EU is continuing to act on its concern for the suffering of the ordinary people of Zimbabwe at this very difficult time. The European Commission has allocated an additional €10 million in relief assistance for people affected by the humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe, while Irish aid to the affected people for the period 2006 to 2008 (to date) amounts to approximately €25m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2167">The failure of the two sides to reach a deal on 27 October on the allocation of Ministries is extremely disappointing. The issue has been referred to a full summit meeting of the South African Development Community (SADC). This summit has been set for 9 November in South Africa. It is Zimbabwe's neighbours, and above all South Africa and other members of SADC which have the greatest potential influence and leverage, and therefore the greatest responsibility to act. I have instructed our Ambassadors in SADC countries to convey our concerns to the authorities in these countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2168">EU Foreign Ministers stated after our meeting of 13 October that the EU stands ready to support a transitional government which is taking steps to restore democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. That commitment stands, and the EU very much hopes that the forthcoming SADC summit will result in the formation of a government of national unity which is credible and reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people, as expressed at the 29 March elections. Given the disappointing rate of progress in the talks on forming a Transition Government, my colleagues and I will not be in a position to consider lifting the EU's restrictive measures on the Zimbabwean leadership when we next meet on 10 November. Ireland supports a co-ordinated international approach to addressing Zimbabwe's problems, once an administration is in place in Harare which is committed to working with the international community to rebuild the country economically and politically.</p>

         his views on the continuing failure of the Northern Ireland Executive to meet, and the comments of Northern Ireland’s former Police Ombudsman that such failure may damage the prospects for the emergence of inclusive political structures; the discussions that have been held recently to which the Irish Government was party; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2170">The Government is committed to the full implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement, including the effective operation of all of the Institutions — the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, the North South Ministerial Council and the British Irish Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_2171">The effective operation of these Institutions, which came into existence on the basis of a mandate from all of the people of this island, is crucial in order to sustain and build upon the massive progress made in Northern Ireland over the last decade. The Government is therefore deeply concerned about the ongoing impasse in the Northern Ireland Executive and the impact which this is having on the operation of the North South Ministerial Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_2172">In relation to the comments of former Police Ombudsman Ms Nuala O'Loan, I would agree that we cannot be complacent and that all efforts must be made to avoid any situation which might be exploited by those on the fringes who would seek to destroy the peace and prosperity which the people of Northern Ireland have worked so hard to achieve.</p>
            <p eId="para_2173">The Government remains in close contact with the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland. The Taoiseach and I held meetings with both Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness on Friday 17 October. I reviewed the overall situation in detail with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in London on Tuesday 28 October, and later that week with the deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in Belfast. I welcome the statement of the First Minister, Peter Robinson, at his party's Conference on Saturday that he hoped the Executive will in a few weeks be able "to get through the present difficulties and to build for the future". I also take encouragement from the peaceful passing of last Sunday's parade and related protests in Belfast.</p>
            <p eId="para_2174">I am pleased that the parties are continuing to engage in discussions and both Governments will continue to offer support and assistance to the parties as they work to find solutions to their current difficulties.</p>

            <p eId="para_2176">Making aid more effective is crucial if we are to reduce poverty in the long term and achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. These goals set out the globally agreed targets and benchmarks for poverty reduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_2177">We know from experience that excessive fragmentation of aid leads to duplication and wastage. It places a heavy burden on the recipients of aid and undermines country ownership and leadership.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">In all of our Programme Countries, Ireland is an active member of the donor community and is working with governments and other donors to promote the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness of 2005. All donors and recipient governments have signed up to the Paris Declaration. The aim is to work more effectively together to achieve value for money and development results. In line with this, we actively help the authorities at national and local level to develop and implement a national development plan that will lead to the reduction of poverty and ensure the poor have better health and education services and will be better able to secure employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">Overall, therefore, Ireland is committed to working in a more harmonised and coordinated aid environment. We work very closely, for instance, with other donors in adopting a coordinated response to the needs and priorities of the countries in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">Likewise, monitoring and evaluation of development programmes are undertaken jointly with other donors and with partner governments. Particular attention is paid to progress in relation to reducing the number of people living below the poverty line and increasing access to basic health, education and water and sanitation. Moreover, all of our programmes incorporate a focus on specific results that can be measured.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2183">I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 136 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">In resolution 1834 the United Nations Security Council expressed its intention to authorise the deployment of a UN military component to follow up EUFOR Chad/CAR in both Chad and the Central African Republic. This resolution also requested that the UN Secretary-General, in close cooperation with the European Union, continue planning and initiate the force generation and logistical, administrative, financial and other necessary arrangements with a view to a transfer of authority between EUFOR and the UN military component, subject to a new decision of the Security Council, on 15 March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2185">Active preparations have commenced. Joint planning between the relevant staffs of the European Union and the United Nations is already underway and a technical team of EUFOR experts has visited New York. The UN Secretary-General is due to submit to the Security Council by 15th November a progress report on ongoing planning and preparations for this follow-on force, including options on the size, structure and mandate of the proposed UN military presence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2186">The Government is positively disposed, in principle, to Irish participation in a UN follow-on force. However, a formal decision to participate will need to await the outcome of ongoing discussions on the size, composition and mandate of the follow-on operation. Such participation will, of course, be subject to the "Triple Lock" of UN mandate and Government and Dáil approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_2187">The ongoing suffering of the people of Darfur is a matter of deep concern. The fracturing of the main rebel groups over the past year, and the apparent determination of the Government of Sudan to pursue a military solution, at a high price in terms of ongoing suffering for ordinary people, makes the search for peace even more difficult. The appointment of Djibril Bassolé as joint AU-UN chief mediator in June 2008 is a positive step, and I am hopeful that his committed efforts to bring the two sides together will be successful. To date, however, the process has been disappointingly slow, and a lack of political will is apparent on all sides. Despite these discouraging developments, there is no alternative to a political solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2188">I strongly condemn the serious human rights abuses against civilians, particularly women and children, which have been a constant feature of the Darfur conflict. In this regard Ireland fully supports the crucial role being played by the ICC in the promotion of international justice, and deeply regrets the lack of co-operation on the part of the Sudanese government with the ICC to date. While the situation in Darfur is very complex there is a need to ensure that serious crimes, such as those which have been committed in Darfur, do not go unpunished.</p>
            <p eId="para_2189">In Darfur, ongoing conflict, including targeted attacks against aid workers and their assets, continues to constitute a major obstacle to humanitarian operations. Since 2006, the Government has committed over €48 million in assistance to the people of Sudan, including Darfur.</p>

            <p eId="para_2191">I myself did not participate in the recent visit by the Taoiseach to China but I am aware that the Taoiseach took the opportunity presented by a bilateral meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao on 23 October to review Chinese-Irish bilateral diplomatic, political and economic relations. In the course of the discussion, the Taoiseach raised the issue of human rights, as he did subsequently the same day in an address to the Chinese Foreign Affairs University.</p>
            <p eId="para_2192">As has been reported to this House on many previous occasions, foreign policy issues and human rights are regularly discussed with the Chinese Government, both in Beijing and Dublin. The Government continues to stress at such meetings the great importance that Ireland attaches to human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and to urge the Chinese authorities to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).</p>
            <p eId="para_2193">Human rights issues also continue to be a constant and important point of dialogue with the Chinese authorities for the European Union, through the framework of the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue. This broad-ranging dialogue has allowed the EU to engage with China on such issues as freedom of expression, the death penalty, the independence of the judiciary, freedom of religion and minority rights, as well as to urge the Chinese authorities to abolish the "re-education through labour" system. Individual human rights cases are also raised. The next round of the dialogue will take place in Beijing on 28 November.</p>

            <p eId="para_2195">I am aware of reports of the incident in question, although the full details of the events are still unclear. The Syrian Government has said only that eight persons were killed, including civilians. The United States has made no official comment, but US sources are reported to have said that the attack successfully targeted an Iraqi leader of Al Qaeda who was active in channelling jihadist fighters and weaponry into Iraq, and in killings of US and Iraqi personnel. Four of the dead were said to be his sons. The Iraqi Government has backed up these reports, although it has otherwise expressed disquiet at the raid.</p>
            <p eId="para_2196">The EU has made no approach to the United States Government about this incursion. It is obviously regrettable that such incidents should occur, particularly if there is any loss of life of innocent civilians. The continuing violence afflicting Iraq requires the full cooperation of all parties to prevent the territory of Iraq's neighbours being used as a base for attacks within the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2197">Despite this incident, there has been an improvement in relations between Syria and the EU in recent months, based on a more constructive Syrian stance on a number of issues. I hope that Syria will continue in this vein, and that the warming of relations can continue.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2199">I take it that the Deputy is referring to the legal regime governing the exploration and exploitation of Ireland's continental shelf.  The regime governing the exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf in international law is set down by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Under that Convention a coastal state is entitled to a continental shelf 200 nautical miles (approx. 370 km) in breadth regardless of whether its continental shelf physically extends that far, subject only to the similar rights of its coastal neighbours.  It may also claim a broader shelf where it can show that the natural prolongation of its land territory under water actually extends beyond that limit.  A claim to extended shelf must be supported by scientific and technical data and be established to the satisfaction of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which was created by the Convention for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_2200">Ireland's shelf naturally extends beyond 200 nautical miles both to the west and the south of the country.  For the purposes of our claims we have divided our shelf into three sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2201">The first sector is to the south-west of the country on the edge of an area known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain.  This sector (which is approximately half the size of the State's land territory) is not disputed by any other state and was therefore the subject of Ireland's first submission to the Commission, made in May 2005. Based upon this submission, the Commission issued its recommendations on the limits of this claimed area in April 2007, allowing Ireland to designate an area of extended shelf of up to 39,000 square kilometres.  The Government has accepted these recommendations and work is now in hand to designate the additional seabed enclosed by these limits as areas to which the Continental Shelf Act 1968 will apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2202">The second sector of claimed extended continental shelf is in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay where there are unresolved boundary issues with the UK, France and Spain.  This sector was the subject of a joint submission by the four countries in May 2006.  It covers an area of approximately 80,000 square kilometres, which is slightly larger than the State's land territory.  The joint submission was examined by a sub-commission established to examine the evidence submitted in support of it.  The four states met with the sub-commission on a number of occasions, most recently in September.  The meeting was positive and the sub-commission has now formulated its draft recommendations. These recommendations have in turn been transmitted to the full Commission and will be considered by it for approval in March 2009.  The question of division of the area between the four states concerned will now be considered after the recommendations have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2203">Ireland also claims continental shelf in the part of the North-East Atlantic Ocean known as the Hatton-Rockall Area, which extends up to 500 nautical miles from the coast.  Ireland and the UK agreed a maritime boundary on the continental shelf here in 1988 but this is not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Færoe Islands), which also make extensive overlapping claims.  The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the issues arising from overlapping claims but have recently concluded that they are unable to reach agreement at the present time.  Nevertheless, the four are keeping the matter under regular review and, in the meantime, Ireland will proceed to make a national submission to the Commission in respect of the Hatton-Rockall Area by the deadline of May 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2206">I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 128 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2207">At the October European Council meeting, the Taoiseach delivered a substantive progress report on developments in Ireland with regard to the Lisbon Treaty since the Council last met in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_2208">The European Council agreed that the Irish Government will continue its consultations and that the Council will discuss this matter again at its December meeting, with a view to defining the elements of a solution and a common path to be followed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2209">It is clear that the concerns of the Irish people need to be addressed as we seek a solution in the months ahead.  At the same time, there is a strong desire among EU partners to see the Treaty ratified.  To date 22 Member States have completed their ratification of the Treaty and a further two have completed their parliamentary procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2210">Throughout its 50-year history, the EU has developed a proud record of successfully accommodating the interests of all Member States.  On this occasion also, there is great willingness on the part of other Member States to work actively with us in the search for solutions.  It is in our interest to arrive at a solution that will secure Ireland's position within the Union and ensure that we can continue to derive maximum benefit from EU membership, including with regard to agriculture, regional policy, the environment and the European single market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2211">There is no doubt that the prospect of Ireland being the only country unable to ratify the Treaty would put us in a difficult position.  It is very likely that this would have consequences in terms of our influence in Brussels.  Our standing in the eyes of foreign investors could be affected by any uncertainty surrounding our position within the Union.  It is in order to avoid such potentially negative consequences that we must work with our EU partners in order to find an agreed solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2212">We are acutely aware that the Member States will want to know soon the basis on which next June's European Parliament elections will be held.  This is also an important matter for the European Parliament.  It is not possible at this point to set a precise timetable for developments in 2009.  The situation is that, if the Lisbon Treaty has not been ratified by all 27 EU Member States in good time before June, the European Parliament elections will be conducted under the existing treaty provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2213">We have always been firmly opposed to any idea of a two-speed Europe and that continues to be the case.  The other member States share this view.  Such a development would not be good for Ireland nor for the Union as a whole.  That is why there is such determination across the Union to arrive at a solution with regard to the Lisbon Treaty that all 27 Member States can endorse.</p>

            <p eId="para_2219">The establishment and deployment of missions is a matter for decision by the Security Council for United Nations missions or the Council of the European Union for EU-led missions, respectively.  The extent to which an individual country participates depends upon a number of factors, including their political will, their level of capability and the number of personnel and other assets they can offer to the mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2220">The norm is that such missions are at the invitation of the government of the country concerned.  In this context the mandate of the mission and the manner in which it is executed are of more relevance than a country's historical record or current political and commercial links.  Both the United Nations and the European Union are committed to deploying missions that are neutral and impartial.</p>

            <p eId="para_2222">The Government has consistently supported the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara.  Ireland has not taken a position on the future of the Territory, be it full independence, autonomy, or integration under Moroccan sovereignty, so long as it is decided in a genuine exercise of self-determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">We strongly support the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in the Western Sahara based on the principle of self-determination.  The term of Mr. Peter Van Walsum as the Special Representative of the Secretary General ended in August.  Secretary General Ban is understood to be in the process of appointing a new Special Representative.</p>
            <p eId="para_2224">Under the auspices of the United Nations, representatives of the Government of Morocco and of the Polisario Front have held a series of four direct meetings in Manhasset, in New York, to discuss the future of the Territory of the Western Sahara.  The most recent meeting was held on 16-18 March 2008.  There has unfortunately been no substantive progress to report from these talks so far. Morocco has set out its vision of an autonomous Government in the Territory, operating under Moroccan sovereignty.  In response the Polisario Front, representing the Saharawi people, has set out its position in favour of the creation of an independent State in close association with Morocco, and with protection for Moroccan vital interests.  Morocco has refused, however, to discuss any proposals which include independence as one of the possibilities for the Territory.</p>
            <p eId="para_2225">Although there is clearly a broad gap between these two competing visions, I regard it as a positive and helpful development that both parties have set out their proposals for the future, and the measures they can envisage to accommodate the concerns of the other side.  The most recent round also agreed some extension of confidence-building measures in relation to family links between Saharawi people in the Territory and in the refugee camps in Algeria. The parties have agreed to meet again, at a date to be decided.</p>

            <p eId="para_2227">The strong Government position on the unacceptable situation in Burma has been consistently conveyed internationally, including and in particular to the countries in the Asia region, whose involvement we see as crucial to a resolution of the problems in Burma.  I welcome in this regard the fact that the ASEM Summit, as its record makes clear, adopted a very positive position on the Burmese situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2228">On the political situation in Burma for example, the ASEM leaders expressed support for the UN in its good offices efforts, and encouraged the Myanmar Government to conduct closer cooperation with the UN.  They also encouraged the Myanmar government to "engage all stakeholders in an inclusive political process in order to achieve national reconciliation and economic and social development", and in this regard they called for "the lifting of restrictions placed on political parties and early further release of those under detention".</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">As I stated in my address to the United Nations General Assembly on 29 September, the Government's immediate focus is on the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, and increased engagement by the UN Secretary General and his Good Offices Mission.  Alongside this, we are working towards securing international support to ensure that the elections to be held in Burma in 2010 are free and fair.  In this context, we will continue to work pro-actively within the EU, including at the General Affairs and External Relations Council next week, where Burma will be discussed.  The Government will of course also continue to provide practical support to the people of Burma and their representatives and supporters, at home and in exile.</p>

            <p eId="para_2231">The Government has no intelligence sources of its own in the Middle East from which to determine the truth of the various and widespread allegations made about weapons programmes in the Middle East, which is a highly militarised and conflict-prone region.</p>
            <p eId="para_2232">It is widely believed that Israel possesses a nuclear weapon capability, but this has never been formally confirmed.  There is widespread international concern, which the Government shares, that Iran's civil nuclear programme may be being developed in such a way as to achieve a nuclear weapons capability.  As I have previously reported to the House, the EU and others are active in trying to persuade Iran to abandon those elements of its programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">Libya has admitted that it was formerly attempting to develop nuclear weapons, and has dismantled its programme under international supervision.  The International Atomic Energy Agency is investigating reports of undeclared nuclear research activity in Syria, which Syria has denied, and no conclusive evidence has as yet emerged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">The former regime in Iraq was at one stage engaged in research into nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, but the stage of development reached, and when these programmes were abandoned, are matters of dispute and controversy.  There is no suggestion that such activities continue in Iraq today.</p>
            <p eId="para_2235">The position of the Government has been clear and consistent.  The Middle East is an area of high tension which contains many regional conflicts and has seen many wars.  The escalation of military capabilities to new heights in such a volatile region can only make the situation more dangerous.  We support the establishment in the Middle East of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction, to include all states in the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_2237">My Department maintains a system of rigorous accounting and audit controls which recognises the various types of risk inherent in its operations at home and abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_2238">In common with other Departments, the Department of Foreign Affairs is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In addition, the Department has its own Evaluation and Audit Unit, which is staffed by professionals and has responsibility for the internal audit function.  Using a risk-based approach, it carries out and oversees a range of audits, evaluations and Value for Money reviews appropriate to the Department's activities.  These cover both Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) and Vote 29 (International Cooperation) of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In view of the scale and complexity of the Government's aid programme, which is delivered in often difficult and challenging environments, clear priority will continue to be given to the audit of expenditure in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2239">In addition to the robust internal systems, the Department has an independent Audit Committee which reports to the Secretary General.

            <p eId="para_2242">I remain deeply concerned in relation to the food security situation in Zimbabwe.  The lack of adequate levels of food is attributable to poor harvests and poor agricultural policies.  Enormous damage has also been inflicted on the Zimbabwean economy by the policies of the Government there.  Zimbabwe is witnessing hyper-inflation, high unemployment and a rapidly depreciating currency.  The suffering of the population is compounded by the high HIV/AIDS prevalence rate, which has contributed to increasing levels of vulnerability.</p>
            <p eId="para_2243">In 2008 Zimbabwe is experiencing another poor main cereal harvest due to a combination of adverse weather conditions, a lack of key agricultural inputs (fertiliser and tractors) and crumbling irrigation systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2244">More than 3 million people are already in need of assistance and this number could rise to as many as 5 million.  This would represent over 40% of the population.  The World Food Programme (WFP) resumed operations in September (following a Government suspension of activity), targeting about 3.25 million vulnerable people in 40 districts during the peak of the hunger period, which stretches from November to February.</p>
            <p eId="para_2245">Ireland has provided more than €25 million in aid to Zimbabwe since 2006.  Irish Aid funding is targeted towards alleviating poverty experienced by the poorest and most vulnerable Zimbabweans.  Our aid is disbursed through UN and non-governmental organisations and in 2008 support has been given to the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organisation as well to as to Irish NGOs for food assistance programmes.  No assistance is channelled through the Zimbabwean Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2246">In addition to our bilateral aid, support has been provided through the European Union humanitarian funding mechanism, as well as from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund to which Ireland is the sixth largest contributor.  We have also sent a member of the Rapid Response Corps to work with UNICEF in Zimbabwe for a five month deployment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2253">I attended the General Affairs and External Relations Council, the GAERC, in Brussels on 13 October 2008.  The meeting, which was chaired by the French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, was the fourth GAERC under the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union and took place against the background of the international financial crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2254">The main item on the agenda was the preparation for the European Council on 15 and 16 October.  My colleagues and I discussed the draft European Council conclusions which covered the economic and financial crisis, the energy and climate change negotiations, energy security, the immigration and asylum pact, the Lisbon Treaty and Russia/Georgia.  These GAERC discussions contributed to the success of the October European Council.  As Deputies will recall, the Taoiseach and I reported to this House on the outcome of the October European Council last Wednesday.</p>
            <p eId="para_2255">At the meeting I expressed support for Commissioner Wallström's invaluable work on a more coherent communications strategy for Commission.  I made the point that the Union needs to be more effective in the way in which it communicates with citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_2256">On the financial crisis the French Presidency briefed the meeting on the conclusions of the previous day's Eurogroup meeting. I was able to confirm to colleagues that the terms of Ireland's bank guarantee scheme had been approved by the Commission the previous evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_2257">On the Lisbon Treaty, I confirmed that the Taoiseach would provide the European Council with a substantive progress report on developments since June.  I informed the meeting that the Taoiseach's report would cover the results of the independent research commissioned by the Government and the establishment of a special parliamentary Committee on Ireland's future in the European Union.  I indicated that the Taoiseach would seek to identify some of the Lisbon Treaty-related issues that would need to be addressed between now and the December European Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_2258">Among the external relations items discussed at the GAERC were EU relations with Belarus and Uzbekistan and the situation in Georgia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2259">The current situation in Zimbabwe was also discussed.  The Council agreed to continue observing closely the implementation of the agreement signed on 15 September by both sides in Zimbabwe.  The Council also expressed concern at the delay in agreeing on a new power-sharing Government, and urged engagement by the South African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU) and the UN in the mediation process led by former South African President Mbeki.  The Council also reiterated its concern about the humanitarian situation and the EU's readiness to re-engage with a new Government which brings a clear promise of change.  It was agreed to consider imposing additional restrictive measures on those responsible, if implementation of the 15 September agreement continues to be blocked.</p>
            <p eId="para_2260">In the interim, the talks on the formation of a government of national unity have reached an impasse.  This lack of progress is very disappointing, and we encourage SADC and the AU to redouble efforts to find a solution to the deadlock.  The EU and Ireland stands ready to support a transitional government which begins to take genuine steps to restore democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe.  However, we remain deeply concerned at the lack of progress to date in these negotiations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2262">The European Council agreed on 14 December 2007 to establish a Reflection Group and appointed Felipe González (former Prime Minister of Spain) as Chairman of the Group.  Two Vice Chairs were also appointed: Vaira Vike-Freiberga (former Latvian President) and Jorma Ollila (former Chairman of Nokia).  The Reflection Group is intended to look at the challenges facing Europe beyond 2020.  The December 2007 European Council invited the Chair and two Vice Chairs to submit a list of nominees for membership of the Group.  The list of nine names proposed by Mr González and his co-chairs was agreed by the European Council on 17 October last.</p>
            <p eId="para_2263">The list proposed by Mr González reflected his desire for a breadth of experience, not limited to the political world.  While I am sure that the person named would have made an excellent contribution to the work of the group, Mr González had to weigh up a number of considerations in making his choice. There are just twelve members on the Reflection Group, which means that less than half of the 27 member States can be represented.  The membership of the Group reflects a balance between larger and smaller states and includes people with experience in different fields, including business, academia and culture, as well as political life.</p>
            <p eId="para_2264">While the result of our referendum had no direct bearing on the composition of the Reflection Group, it is clear that the priority for Ireland in the coming period will be to find a solution with regard to the Lisbon Treaty that will secure Ireland's future position within the European Union.</p>

            <p eId="para_2274">Since the referendum in June I have discussed the outcome and its implications with my counterparts in the Council of Ministers, and with leaders of the European Parliament and the European Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2275">The European Council agreed in October that the Irish Government will continue its consultations with a view to contributing to finding a way to resolve the situation.  That is exactly what the Irish Government is doing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2276">Over the last month the Government has been very active in consulting with EU partners.  At the beginning of October the Taoiseach again met President Sarkozy, in his capacity as President of the European Council, this time in Paris, a meeting which I also attended.  I also accompanied the Taoiseach to the European Council meeting in Brussels on 15 — 16 October, during which the Lisbon Treaty was discussed and formal Conclusions adopted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2277">I have also had the opportunity to discuss the situation surrounding the Lisbon Treaty with many of my colleagues during bilateral meetings.  On 2 October, I met with the Czech Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs, Alexandr Vondra in Dublin.  I visited Brussels on 6 October and held separate bilateral meetings with the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso and with Commission Vice President, Margot Wallström, who is responsible within the European Commission for their communications strategy.  I also had a bilateral meeting with Jo Leinen MEP, Chair of the European Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee, before I addressed a plenary session of that Committee concerning the Lisbon Treaty.  My appearance before the Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee provided a welcome opportunity to engage in a dialogue with many of the members of that Committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_2281">Senior officials are defined by the United Nations as Deputy Secretaries General, Under-Secretaries-General and Assistant Secretaries-General or those of equivalent rank.  There are currently two such posts within the United Nations administration held by Irish citizens.  Ms Patricia O'Brien is Under-Secretary-General for Legal Affairs and Legal Counsel.  Mr Peter Sutherland is the Special Representative of the Secretary General on Migration.  While Mr Sutherland is listed as a senior official, he is based in London and works on a pro bono basis.  An Irish national, Patricia O'Donovan, also occupies the post of Executive Director for Management and Administration in the International Labour Organisation, and as such, is a senior official as identified above.</p>
            <p eId="para_2282">Appointments to positions as Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General, as well as to those of heads of the United Nations programmes and funds, are the personal responsibility of the Secretary-General, in accordance with his position as Chief Administrative Officer of the Organisation under the UN Charter.  In deciding on appointments at the senior and policy-making levels, the Secretary-General takes into account primarily the qualifications and experience of candidates for Under-Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General and higher levels, with due importance given to ensuring equitable regional representation.  Confirmation by the General Assembly of appointments made by the Secretary-General may be required in certain instances, for example, in relation to the post of Commissioner-General for the UN Reliefs and Work Agency (UNWRA).</p>
            <p eId="para_2283">The Secretary-General appoints a single Deputy Secretary-General following consultations with Member States and in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter of the United Nations.  The term of office of the Deputy Secretary-General does not exceed that of the Secretary-General.</p>
            <p eId="para_2284">An informal group of independent advisers on senior UN appointments was established in 1997.  It comprises prominent individuals who are familiar with the United Nations system.  The Secretary General, as and when necessary, consults them with regard to senior-level appointments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2285">Regarding Irish staffing levels as a whole in the UN Secretariat, as of June 2008 Ireland had a total of 163 staff within the Secretariat, accounting for 0.41% of Secretariat staff.  This included 75 staff in professional and higher categories.</p>

            <p eId="para_2287">The election of a new Administration in the US provides a clear opportunity to re-assess and re-energise the transatlantic relationship.  Under the French Presidency, the EU has been giving active consideration to this and Foreign Ministers have twice discussed what should be the priorities in our relations with the new Administration, most recently at a meeting which I attended in Marseilles on Monday.  This non-exhaustive list of priorities will be conveyed to the President-elect.</p>
            <p eId="para_2288">There is agreement within the EU that there needs to be genuine dialogue and cooperation with the new Administration on all the major global issues we face — from climate change, food and energy security, through to the Middle East, Iran, and Russia.  It is clear that an intensification of efforts to achieve progress towards a two-State solution in the Middle East must be a new priority for future EU-US cooperation.  We must also work to encourage the US to engage more actively in multilateral fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_2289">At Monday's meeting, I stressed the importance of encouraging the new Administration to demonstrate movement on issues fundamental to our shared values — such as the closure of Guantánamo. In relation to Guantánamo, we must recognise that our joint efforts to combat terrorism and our work in upholding human rights require the early resolution of this contentious issue.  I also called for human rights, a cornerstone of Irish and EU foreign policy, to be given due prominence in the EU-US dialogue.</p>

            <p eId="para_2291">The Government's aid programme, Irish Aid, provides assistance to over ninety developing countries.  Nine have been designated as Programme Countries, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  These are Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho, Vietnam and Timor Leste.  Support to Programme Countries is framed in agreed country strategies, with a comprehensive focus on poverty reduction through the implementation of each country's own national development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2292">The priorities for the aid programme remain as set out in the Government's White Paper on Irish Aid, which was published in 2006.  It included a commitment to increase the number of key partner countries from eight to ten in the medium term.  Malawi was designated Ireland's ninth Programme Country in 2007.  An Embassy has been established in the capital, Lilongwe, and €10 million in programme assistance will be provided this year.  This is focused on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people, with a strong emphasis on sustainable food security, nutrition and improvements in agriculture.  The Government will also provide a further €5 million this year for the development work of Irish and other NGOs in Malawi.</p>
            <p eId="para_2293">Irish Aid has also undertaken preliminary work on the identification of a tenth Programme Country.  Further analysis will be required before any decision is taken.  In keeping with the conclusions of the White Paper, Africa, which includes 34 of the world's least developed countries, will remain the primary geographic focus for Ireland's development programme in the years ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_2298">I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 151, 277 and 278 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2299">The resurgence of fighting in the North Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is a matter of grave concern, both in terms of its implications for the humanitarian situation, and for the stability of the wider Great Lakes region. It has seriously undermined the Goma and Nairobi Peace Agreements, and placed the progress made over the past year in the Great Lakes peace process in grave jeopardy. The situation, notwithstanding a fragile ceasefire, remains volatile. I am particularly concerned by reports of widespread attacks on civilians by all sides in the conflict, and by the plight of the estimated 1.5 million people now displaced in DRC, more than a million of whom are in North Kivu. News of clashes yesterday is also disturbing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2300">MONUC, the UN peacekeeping force, which at 17,000-strong is the UN's largest peacekeeping operation, is mandated to use all means necessary to protect the civilian population. Since 2001, three Irish Defence Forces officers have been deployed with the mission as Military Liaison Officers. MONUC is now seriously over-stretched, and UN officials have called for extra troops and air assets. The UN Security Council is fully seized of the situation and has been discussing appropriate responses as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2301">UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has been heavily engaged in discussions in an effort to stabilize the situation. Secretary General Ban's appointment of the former Nigerian President, Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo, an experienced mediator in regional disputes, as his Special Envoy to broker a political settlement, is a particularly welcome development. The African Union (AU), led by its current chairman, President Kikwete of Tanzania, has also been to the forefront of efforts to restore calm. It is not as yet clear if there will be agreement to hold talks involving the DRC and Rwandan governments, as urged by the Secretary General.</p>
            <p eId="para_2302">The EU is the largest humanitarian donor to the DRC, and has played a key role in supporting peace efforts to date. Ireland fully supports the excellent work of the EU's Special Representative to the Great Lakes, Roeland van de Geer. Last week, the EU Commissioner for Development, Louis Michel, visited Kinshasa and Kigali to urge the Presidents of both countries to find a diplomatic solution to the current crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2303">I also commend the efforts of my British and French counterparts, David Miliband and Bernard Kouchner, who have been engaged in vigorous diplomatic efforts over the past week, and met with Presidents Kabila and Kagame during a visit to the Great Lakes last weekend, and briefed colleagues in Marseilles on Monday. At present it does not appear that there is likely to be an ESDP mission, with the focus instead being on support for the UN.</p>
            <p eId="para_2304">Ireland is a significant humanitarian donor to the DRC. Already in 2008, Ireland has committed over €11 million in humanitarian aid funding, and our support to the country since 2006 totals over €31 million. In response to this worsening crisis, the Government has set aside up to €1 million in extra funding for humanitarian relief in North Kivu. In addition, Irish Aid has allocated more than €8 million in funding to Rwanda since 2006. The EU has announced an additional €4 million in humanitarian aid for North Kivu.</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">The crisis in DRC will be high on the agenda when I meet with my EU colleagues at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 November.</p>

            <p eId="para_2341">I am closely monitoring developments in Colombia, including the human rights situation. Together with our EU partners, Ireland is keenly aware of the difficulties in the implementation of the Justice and Peace Law, the legal framework for the peace process in Colombia. I am particularly concerned about reports suggesting that the situation is deteriorating in relation to human rights defenders and victims. At the same time, this year has seen some notable successes by the Colombian government in its efforts to bring peace and stability to Colombia. These include the rescue of Ingrid Betancourt and 14 other hostages held by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) on 2 July and the escape of former Colombian congressman Oscar Tulio Lizcano from the FARC in October. On 16 October, the FARC informed a group of Colombians, including prominent public figures, that it will exchange letters with the group to discuss the possible release of hostages the rebels are holding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2342">Ireland contributed €150,000 in 2008 to the Organisation of American States' Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which works in Colombia as well as other countries in the region. My officials are in regular contact with the Colombian Embassy in London, which is accredited to Ireland. In addition, Ireland has contact with Colombian government and civil society through our Embassy in Mexico City which is accredited to Colombia, and through information-sharing and joint action with our EU partners, some of whom have resident Missions in Colombia.</p>

            <p eId="para_2344">Ireland and its EU partners believe that the United States trade policy towards Cuba is fundamentally a bilateral issue. However, the EU cannot accept that unilateral measures imposed by the US on specific countries limit the Union's economic and commercial relations with third countries, in this case Cuba. Furthermore, the EU rejects all unilateral measures against Cuba which are contrary to commonly accept rules of international trade, and believes that the lifting of the US trade embargo would open Cuba's economy to the benefit of the Cuban people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">For these reasons, and in spite of concerns regarding Cuba's human rights record, as in previous years Ireland and our EU partners therefore voted on 30 October 2008 in favour of the annual Cuban-tabled UN General Assembly resolution calling for an end to this embargo.</p>

            <p eId="para_2349">The issue of extraordinary rendition has been raised on numerous occasions in this House. As has been made repeatedly clear, the Government is completely opposed to the practice of the extraordinary rendition of prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">I wish to reiterate at the outset that none of the various investigations into allegations of extraordinary rendition have revealed any evidence, or even resulted in a specific allegation, that any person has on any occasion been subjected to extraordinary rendition through Ireland, including in the case mentioned by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">The Government has received specific assurances from the US authorities that such prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory, nor would they be, without our permission. These assurances have been confirmed at the highest level, including by Secretary of State Rice to my predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Dermot Ahern T.D. and by President Bush to the former Taoiseach. The assurances are of a clear and categoric nature, relating to facts and circumstances within the full knowledge and control of the US Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">The Government take very seriously the fulfilment of the State's obligations under international agreements to which it is a party, including the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and will respond appropriately to any relevant requests made to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2353">The Government has established a Cabinet Committee on Aspects of International Human Rights. As part of its remit, the Committee has reviewed the Programme for Government commitments in relation to our opposition to extraordinary rendition. The Committee has agreed that early contact should be made with the new US administration to seek a clear statement of intent that extraordinary rendition would cease and would not resume during the new President's term of office. Commitments are also being sought in regard to the closure of Guantanamo Bay and to the prohibition of intensive interrogation techniques such as water-boarding, which are internationally considered to constitute torture. I have asked our Ambassador in Washington to follow up on this as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">With a view to strengthening as necessary the legislative provisions, the Committee is also to review the statutory powers currently available to the civil and police authorities regarding the search and inspection of aircraft, in the context of the obligations on the State under the Chicago Convention.</p>

         if the recently signed economic partnership agreement between the EU and 13 Caribbean nations took account of the concerns of many non-governmental organisations, including Irish NGOs, on aid, trade and the right to a form of development that would take account of differing indigenous, economic, social and cultural circumstances.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_2356">The Government has worked consistently to ensure that the negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries should support the ACP countries' development needs and their poverty reduction programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">I welcome the signature on 15 October of an Economic Partnership Agreement between the EU and thirteen of the fifteen members of the Caribbean Forum of African Caribbean Pacific States (CARIFORUM). The Republic of Guyana subsequently signed the Agreement on 20 October. The EU has pledged to work with Haiti and other Caribbean partners towards signature by Haiti, the fifteenth CARIFORUM member State. In the meantime, as a Least Developed Country, Haiti will continue to benefit from free access to European markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2358">I have had discussions with Irish and other NGOs on their concerns that the Economic Partnership Agreements offered to the ACP countries by the EU do not sufficiently address development needs. I have outlined the role which Ireland is playing to ensure that development needs are strongly supported in the Agreements, including the Agreement with the Caribbean States.</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">The negotiations leading up to the Agreement were launched in April 2004. The negotiating mandate was derived from the legally-binding 2000 Cotonou Agreement between the EU and the ACP states, the central objective of which is the "reduction and eventual eradication of poverty, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy". The resulting Agreement is the first comprehensive North-South trade and development agreement in the global economy. It includes a package of measures to stimulate trade, investment and innovation and will help build a regional market among the Caribbean countries. It also promotes sustainable development and poverty elimination through a series of important transition periods and safeguard clauses and the implementation of enhanced development cooperation to support the implementation of the Agreement. This will include financial cooperation from the European Development Fund and from EU member States.</p>

            <p eId="para_2362">As I have stated previously in the House, the pace and substance of the dialogue have been unsatisfactory to date. Nevertheless, I believe that dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama or his representatives remains the most effective way to achieve the protection of Tibetan culture, identity, religion and human rights, and some measure of autonomy for Tibet within China. Our views have been communicated to the Chinese government on a number of occasions both in Dublin and Beijing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2363">I hope that this latest round of dialogue will help facilitate progress towards the achievement of these goals.  The European Union has not been invited to act as a mediator in the dialogue process.</p>

            <p eId="para_2365">The EU- and World Bank-sponsored donor conference for Georgia on 22 October in Brussels proved a highly successful event. A total of 71 delegations attended, many of them led at a high level. Ambassador Marie Cross, Ireland's representative on the Political and Security Committee of the European Union, represented Ireland. A sum of €3.6 billion was pledged to Georgia's ongoing reconstruction and reform efforts, and Ireland indicated it would allocate €2 million in official development assistance to Georgia from 2008 to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2366">In response to the crisis in Georgia in August, Ireland provided €100,000 to assist the relief efforts of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). A further €150,000 has been allocated to assist UNHCR with the provision of shelter and non-food items to the displaced. Irish Aid has also provided US$20,000 to the International Medical Support Services (IMSS) to assist with providing relief supplies and medical assistance to the displaced. Financial contributions have been made to support the deployment of a member of Ireland's Rapid Response Corps with UNICEF and to support the deployment of 4 Irish civilian monitors as part of the EU Monitoring Mission in Georgia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2367">Under the terms of the 12 August 6-point peace plan, the 8 September agreement, and in order to find a settlement of the current dispute in Georgia, peace talks were held in Geneva on 15 October under the co-chairmanship of the EU, the UN and the OSCE. Although the first session was somewhat restricted owing to disputes between the parties, it was agreed the talks would reconvene on 18 November. I would hope that at this meeting matters of substance can be addressed, including the plight of Internally Displaced Persons, which is becoming more acute as winter approaches. In this regard, I plan to visit Georgia in the near future in order to assess conditions on the ground and for discussions with political leaders there.</p>

            <p eId="para_2374">The Irish Human Rights Commission was established in July 2001 in accordance with the commitment contained in the Good Friday Agreement to establish Human Rights Commissions both in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland. The Agreement also envisages a Joint Committee of representatives of the two Human Rights Commissions, North and South, as a forum for the consideration of human rights issues on the island of Ireland.

There was no provision for a merger of the two bodies.

            <p eId="para_2378">While significant progress has been made towards the full implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement, the Executive is at present experiencing difficulties in coming to agreement on a number of issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2379">The devolution of policing and justice remains the most pressing of these issues. It is the shared view of the Irish and British Governments that the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly should take on this responsibility as set out in the St. Andrews Agreement. While therefore it is primarily for the parties to reach agreement between themselves on when and how this should take place, the two Governments remain actively engaged and ready to assist the parties to resolve their outstanding difficulties on this issue. In this regard, I reviewed the overall situation in detail with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in London on Tuesday 28 October, and later that week with the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, in Belfast. In this regard also, I welcome the statement of the First Minister, Peter Robinson, at his party's Conference on Saturday that he hoped the Executive will in a few weeks be able "to get through the present difficulties and to build for the future". I also take encouragement from, and pay tribute to all involved, for the peaceful passing of last Sunday's parade and protests in Belfast.</p>
            <p eId="para_2380">Upon restoration of devolution in May 2007, the enhancement and protection of the Irish language in Northern Ireland became a devolved matter for consideration by the parties in the Executive. Minister Ó Cuív has discussed progress in this regard in his meetings with his counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Mr. Gregory Campbell MLA, and his predecessor, Mr. Edwin Poots MLA. Minister Campbell has indicated that he will brief the Northern Ireland Assembly's Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure in the coming weeks on progress that has been made in developing a language strategy. I will continue to carefully follow developments in this area, and to review them with the Secretary of State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2381">As devolved matters, the subject of education standards and any decision on the regeneration of the Maze/Longkesh site are for the consideration of the Northern Ireland Executive. I would encourage the parties, however, to find an agreed way forward on these issues as soon as possible.</p>

We believe that the development of such systems can have many negative consequences, including creating or aggravating missile arms races. The most effective way to tackle missile proliferation and the attendant threats is to engage in serious work in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation. Ireland has traditionally played a very active role in such efforts, particularly within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and elsewhere.</p>

            <p eId="para_2388">The demand of the Chagossian natives to return to the Chagossian archipelago is a complex issue which also involves competing sovereignty claims and legal arguments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2389">In November 2000, the High Court in Britain ruled that the "wholesale removal" of the Islanders between 1967 and 1971 was an "abject legal failure" and that they could return to the small outlying islands in the group but not the largest, Diego Garcia.  The ruling also granted the islanders British citizenship.  Following this ruling, the British Government commissioned a study on island resettlement and concluded that it was "impractical and inconsistent with the existing defence facilities".  A study commissioned by the Islanders refutes the idea that resettlement is "impractical".</p>
            <p eId="para_2390">In November 2002 the Islanders launched a separate case in the High Court in England claiming that they had been treated in such a way by the British Government as to entitle them to compensation and return of their property. In October 2003, the Islanders lost this claim for compensation. In June 2004 a royal decree was issued in Britain banning the Chagos Islanders from returning to the islands. In October 2004 the High Court agreed to a judicial review of the royal decree, and it was overturned in May 2006. This decision was supported by the Court of Appeal in May 2007. The British Government requested that the House of Lords examine this decision in June 2008, and on 22 October the Law Lords ruled that the royal decree was indeed immune from scrutiny, and the ban on returning to the islands should stand. The Law Lords ruling is the final judgement in the British legal system. The group have claimed that they may bring their case to the European Court for Human Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">The Government will continue to monitor the situation of the Chagossian Archipelago. We would wish to see the issue resolved by agreement between the parties, and in a manner which properly addresses the unfortunate situation of the Chagos Islanders. However, we note that the matter is one which has been pursued through the appropriate British legal and judicial channels.</p>

            <p eId="para_2396">From Ireland's national standpoint, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) remains the corner-stone of the non-proliferation regime. It is the main international mechanism for controlling the spread of nuclear weapons, and contains the only multilateral obligation to nuclear disarmament in the text of a treaty by the five recognised nuclear weapons States (US, UK, France, the Russian Federation and China).</p>
            <p eId="para_2397">At the Seventh Review Conference in May 2005, there were fundamental differences between those who wanted the conference to focus on proliferation, and those — the majority — who emphasised the lack of serious nuclear disarmament by the nuclear weapons States. The failure of the 2005 Review Conference to reach an outcome makes it more important than ever to have a successful Conference in 2010, and Ireland will work hard to bring this about. Clearly, the views of nuclear weapons states are crucial. Since 2005, there have been annual preparatory meetings aimed at achieving this objective. The final such meeting ahead of the Review Conference will be held in New York during May of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2398">With the upcoming change of administration in the United States, there are indications that alterations to certain policies, including towards the NPT, may be in the offing. Such changes could help create conditions more conducive to a successful 2010 Review Conference.</p>

            <p eId="para_2404">The report of the Hunger Task Force was presented to the Taoiseach on 25 September at the United Nations in New York. It represents a year's work, commissioned by the Government, conducted by a group of eminent national and international experts. While recognising that hunger and food security is a complex area requiring a multifaceted response, the Report focused on three specific thematic areas which, if addressed, should make an effective contribution to reducing and eventually eliminating world hunger. These three thematic areas are:</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">Increase smallholder agricultural productivity in Africa;</p>
            <p eId="para_2406">Target maternal and infant undernutrition; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2407">Make hunger a priority at both national and international level and ensure that donor and recipient governments fulfil their commitments to its eradication.</p>
            <p eId="para_2408">I welcome this focused approach on these three thematic areas and I agree with the Task Force that progress in these specific areas will have a real impact.  With the aim of moving the recommendations of the Hunger Task Force forward I am establishing a special unit within Irish Aid, to focus on agriculture and food security. I am also establishing a managerial task team to bring together the full range of expertise available within Irish Aid in the area of food security and related disciplines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">The first job of the food security and agriculture unit will be to carry out an audit of the work of Irish Aid which currently addresses food security across the programme. Based on that analysis, we will assess how best we can improve our performance across all of the three themes highlighted in the Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">The commissioning of the work of the Hunger Task Force by the Government, before the current global food security crisis hit the headlines, was innovative and far sighted. The Report has been warmly welcomed, nationally and internationally. I can assure the Deputy that I intend to take the Report forward and ensure that Ireland can make a real difference, by our own efforts on the ground and by our influence internationally, to reduce the scourge of global hunger.</p>

The Committee also noted some subjects of concern and made a number of recommendations in this regard. The Committee, in accordance with its rules of procedure, has requested that Ireland should provide relevant information within one year, i.e. by 30 July 2009, on implementation of three of the Committee's recommendations (made in paragraphs 11, 15 and 22 of its concluding observations document) and has requested that information on all the remaining recommendations be provided in Ireland's fourth periodic report which is due to be submitted by 31 July 2012.

It is estimated that 140,000 people were killed or remain missing as a result of the cyclone, with approximately 2.4 million people affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">Over €1.3 million in humanitarian funding was provided by Irish Aid to assist those affected by Cyclone Nargis. This funding was provided primarily to NGO partners with existing programmes or partnerships in Burma, such as Trócaire, World Vision and Save the Children. Funding was also provided to the World Food Programme (WFP) for logistics support to humanitarian organisations, a particularly important and challenging area of work given the serious damage to infrastructure following the cyclone.</p>
            <p eId="para_2424">In addition, two separate shipments of essential relief items were provided from Ireland's supplies pre-positioned at the UN's humanitarian response depot in Brindisi, Italy and at the Curragh Camp in Ireland in May and June 2008.

            <p eId="para_2425">The UN's Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) — to which Ireland is the sixth largest contributor — was also critical in responding to the most urgent needs of those affected by Cyclone Nargis.

            <p eId="para_2444">In the future, FÁS also plans to develop Gweedore Training Centre to deliver courses in the area of Renewable Energies, particularly solar and wind turbine.  This is dependent on funding availability.  A Dry Stonebuilding Course is currently being developed in partnership with the Stonebuilding industry and also the Donegal Stonebuilding Association.  While there are no immediate plans to reduce either the availability of courses or the numbers trained the downturn in the construction industry may lead to reduced numbers in apprenticeship courses in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2447">Whilst pump prices have decreased since September, notwithstanding the appreciation in value of the dollar against the euro during that period, I consider it important that there should be greater transparency between the manner in which the retail price for fuel paid by consumers follows changes in the wholesale price. I am advised by the Agency that work in relation to this matter is well underway. I understand that as part of its work, the Agency will seek to benchmark movements in prices in Ireland against those in other EU countries and that it will also seek to examine the frequency and the timeliness in which changes in the wholesale price are being passed on to consumers. I expect to receive the Agency's report into this matter next month.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2490">I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 to 180, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2491">As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget 2009 address, announced that the proposed decentralisation of a number of bodies was being deferred pending a review in 2011. This impacts on five agencies under my remit viz. FÁS, Enterprise Ireland (EI), Health and Safety Authority (HSA), National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) and National Consumer Agency (NCA).</p>
            <p eId="para_2492">The number of advance staff moves that have taken place up to 31 October 2008 as part of the Government's decentralisation programme, both in my Department and those agencies under my remit as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, are set out in the following tabular statement: this statement also gives the breakdown between technical staff and managerial (including administrative and non-technical staff).</p>
            <p eId="para_2493">The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA) has fully decentralised to Naas, Co Kildare with a current staff compliment of eleven, four of whom are technical and seven are managerial staff (including administrative and non-technical staff).</p>
            <p eId="para_2494">In parallel with the decentralisation process, EI has strengthened its regional focus in recent years and now has a major presence in the Shannon Region in addition to its nine other regional offices.  Certain functions previously carried out by Shannon Development under delegated authority from Enterprise Ireland reverted to Enterprise Ireland on 1st January 2007 and, as part of this process, a number of posts from Shannon Development transferred to Enterprise Ireland.  The agency strengthened its regional presence by establishing its new Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and also houses its County Enterprise Coordination Unit there.  Six posts were assigned to the new office in Shannon from Dublin, to manage this new Regional HQ. Currently there are 66 staff working in the EI Shannon office, none of whom are technical.  They are located in Shannon Westpark.  In respect of the floor areas and occupancy capacity for the above, the information required by the Deputy is set out in the following tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2495">In respect of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the total floor area of those facilities, which are decentralising, is approximately 3,300 square metres.  The occupancy capacity of those facilities is estimated to be 164.  The current situation regarding the full move of over 250 people from the Department is that the formal application for planning permission for the permanent building was lodged with Carlow Town Council on 18th April 2008.  Planning permission, with conditions, was granted on 12th June 2008 subject to appeal.  The Office of Public Works has since advised that two objection lodged against the planning permission have been referred to An Bord Pleanála.  An Bord Pleanála website indicates that the appeal cases are due to be decided by 10 November 2008.   In light of this, it is difficult to provide a target date for completion of construction of the permanent office which appears is unlikely to happen before last quarter 2010. Until this is decided upon, it is not possible to give an exact floor area or the occupancy capacity of the proposed new permanent building.</p>
            <p eId="para_2496">In view of the proposed review taking place in 2011, it is also not possible to give details of the full extent of the floor areas of the facilities which the relevant five agencies (viz. FÁS, EI, HSA, NSAI and NCA) will be required to vacate and the timescale attaching to same.</p>

            <p eId="para_2567">I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a general right to repayment of tax overpaid is provided for by section 865, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  That section also imposes a statutory 4 year time limit on claims for repayment made on or after 1st January 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2568">Under the provisions of section 865, a repayment is subject to a valid claim being made (such as the submission of a ‘full and true' Return of Income), within 4 years from the end of the tax year to which it relates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2569">Section 865, and the Interest on Repayments provisions in section 865A, were designed to achieve the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers (including parity of treatment between PAYE and self employed taxpayers), while, at the same time providing necessary protection for the Exchequer from exposure to claims going back many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2570">The self-assessment system provides that taxpayers are obliged to make their tax returns by the specified return date.  Income Tax returns for 2001, 2002 and 2003 had return filing dates of 31/10/2002, 31/10/2003 and 31/10/2004, respectively.  Taxpayers were obliged to submit their Returns of Income, for the years listed, to the Offices of the Collector General on, or before, those dates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2571">In the case of the person mentioned Returns of Income for the years in question were filed in April 2008.  For 2001 a paper return, dated 23/4/2008, was submitted to Tralee Revenue Office.  For years 2002 and 2003 returns were filed via Revenue Online System (ROS) and are recorded as received on 25/4/2008.  Those returns were processed and the resulting assessments showed tax overpaid for each year.  However, as the 4 year time limit, for each of the years, had expired (on 31/12/2005, 31/12/2006 and 31/12/2007, respectively) the repayments could not be paid to this person.</p>
            <p eId="para_2572">Section 955, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is a separate piece of legislation, which also applies from 1st January 2005.  This section places a 4 year time limit on the Inspector's right to make or amend an assessment.  Under the provisions of section 955, no assessment or amendment to an assessment to Income Tax for any relevant tax year can be made any later than four years after the end of the tax year in which the taxpayer has filed a ‘full and true' tax return.</p>
            <p eId="para_2573">That section ensures that a taxpayer cannot avoid payment of tax, correctly due to the Exchequer, by delaying the submission of his Returns of Income while also providing the taxpayer who files a ‘full and true' return with the assurance that, apart from cases where fraud or neglect is suspected, the Inspector is precluded from making or amending assessments after the 4 year period set out in section 955 has expired.</p>
            <p eId="para_2574">Section 955(2)(a)(ii) repeats the time limit provisions contained in section 865 in relation to repayment of tax overpaid.</p>

            <p eId="para_2591">The cost of the scheme will depend on uptake. The estimated full year cost of €0.4 million is based on an assumption that approximately 7,000 employees will avail of the scheme over the first five year period of the operation of the scheme (the exemption may apply only once in any five year period in respect of any employee).</p>
            <p eId="para_2592">The scheme has been designed with a view to ensuring that the administration costs for the Exchequer and employers will be minimal.  The concept of a benefit in kind does not arise in the case of the self-employed.  For self-employed persons all expenses "wholly and exclusively" incurred for the purpose of their trade or profession are allowable for tax purposes.  However, there is no tax deduction for self-employed persons in respect of costs incurred by them in relation to travelling to and from their place of business.  This general principle will remain unchanged.</p>

            <p eId="para_2798">A total of €18.8m has been spent on acquiring sites in respect of those projects which are being deferred pending a review in 2011. The locations in question are Birr, Cavan, Dungarvan, Edenderry, Thomastown, Thurles and Waterford. In addition, a site has been purchased at Knock, at a cost of €390,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2799">Approximately €4m has been spent to date by the OPW on the costs of renting and fitting out of mainly Civil Service properties in advance party locations where permanent accommodation has been deferred pending a review in 2011. A further €1.194m has been expended by FÁS in respect of the advance office at Birr, €856,000 was expended by the Health and Safety Authority in respect of its Kilkenny advance office and approximately €305,000 has been expended by Pobal in respect of its premises at Clifden. Staff in such locations will remain in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2800">In addition, I am informed by my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment that in parallel with the decentralisation process, Enterprise Ireland (EI) strengthened its regional focus in recent years and now has a major presence in the Shannon Region in addition to its nine other regional offices.  Certain functions previously carried out by Shannon Development under delegated authority from Enterprise Ireland reverted to Enterprise Ireland on 1st January 2007 and, as part of this process, a number of posts from Shannon Development transferred to Enterprise Ireland.  The agency strengthened its regional presence by establishing its new Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and also houses its County Enterprise Coordination Unit there.  Six posts were assigned to the new office in Shannon from Dublin, to manage this new Regional HQ. Currently there are 66 staff working in the EI Shannon office.</p>
            <p eId="para_2801">The annual rent on the Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon is €336,600.  The tendered contract sum for the fit out was €1.43m, including VAT.</p>

            <p eId="para_2803">The Deputy may wish to know that total income from property disposed of in Dublin between January 2004 and December 2007 was €355.9m.  In addition, property valued at €75 million was transferred to the Affordable Homes Partnership.  The OPW has also agreed joint venture redevelopment schemes with a minimum value of circa €125m up to the end of 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_2876">It is estimated that the VAT and excise measures introduced in Budget 2009 will add approximately 0.7 percentage points to CPI inflation in a full year.  Notwithstanding these measures, inflation is expected to moderate in 2009 and beyond.</p>
            <p eId="para_2877">The Government's Budget Day forecasts show that CPI inflation is expected to average 2½% in 2009 (on the usual technical assumption of no further changes in interest rates), down from an estimated average of 4½% this year.  On a harmonised basis, inflation is expected to average 1.9% over the period 2009-2011, in line with the European Central Bank's target.  This easing in inflationary pressures is a welcome development at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_2879">Following the recent Government decision to withdraw automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over and to raise the means assessment threshold for persons in that age cohort, it is estimated that approximately 5% (20,000) of persons aged 70 and over will no longer qualify for a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_2880">The Government appointed Mr. Eddie Sullivan to make recommendations on a new single annual capitation fee to be paid to general practitioners in respect of medical card holders aged 70 and over in the community.  Mr. Sullivan recommended a single capitation fee of €290, which would come into effect, subject to the proposed legislative changes, from 1st January 2009.  Mr. Sullivan's recommendations were accepted by Government last week.  Mr. Sullivan estimated that this would generate savings of the order of €16 million in 2009.  In addition it is estimated that further savings of approximately €20 million will arise in 2009, in respect of reduced drug costs, superannuation costs, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2881">The Government believe that there is potential for significant savings of at least €64 million in drug costs under the GMS and community drug schemes, without compromising on patient care.  Accordingly, it has decided to establish a process under the chairmanship of Dr. Michael Barry, to develop recommendations for good practice which will secure safe and effective prescribing for patients, while maximising the potential for the economy in the use of public funds.  The initial report from Dr. Barry will be prepared by 1st December 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2894">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility (Category 1, i.e. medical card holders) or limited eligibility (Category 2) for health services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2895">Persons in Category 1 are entitled to a full range of services free of charge including, inter alia, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services. Persons in Category 2 (non medical card holders) are also entitled, inter alia, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services but subject to certain charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_2896">Individuals who opt to avail of in-patient services privately shall be deemed not to have full or limited eligibility for those in-patient services. In-patient care includes convalescent care. Membership of a health insurance scheme does not, of itself, imply private status.</p>
            <p eId="para_2897">If the Deputy is aware of a specific case in this context, he may wish to raise it directly with the Health Service Executive in order to have the matter investigated.</p>

            <p eId="para_2899">The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act.  Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2900">The list of scheduled substances is kept under review; in particular, my Department reviews any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health.</p>
            <p eId="para_2901">Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is not currently a scheduled substance under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  However, a risk assessment of new psychoactive substances carried out by the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction has found that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long term effects of the substance are still unknown.  Against this background, the European Council decided in March 2008 to place BZP under control, which was deemed to pose an excessive risk as a ‘party pill', in accordance with the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances.  Member States must act as soon as possible, but no later than one year from the date of the decision, to introduce control measures and criminal sanctions.  Work is under way in my Department with a view to introducing the necessary control measures here by way of statutory regulation within the given timeframe, to restrict the availability of BZP.</p>

            <p eId="para_2905">The O.E.C.D. Public Management Reviews: Ireland — Towards an Integrated Public Service (2008) in its case study "Reconfiguration of the Health Services" notes:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2906">"One statistical characteristic of Ireland is its very large number of practising nurses (15.2 per 1,000), which is twice the OECD average, just below Norway (15.4) but much higher than UK (9.1) or France (7.7).  The number of nurses graduating every year is also high (14.4), above Norway (10.1), UK (8.6) or France (5.9).  This contradicts the universal perception of a "shortage" of nurses, held by health actors in Ireland who were interviewed by the OECD.  Partial explanations come from the fact that some 40% of nurses in Ireland work part-time (as compared for example with 26% in France for nurses working in hospitals)."</p>
            <p eId="para_2907">In outlining the detail of the 2009 Estimates for the health services, I announced that the H.S.E. is to deliver economy savings of €115m as part of Budget 2008. Among other issues this includes a reduction in nurse training expenditure in 2009. The total cost of nurse education to the Health Services, both undergraduate and post-registration, is currently in excess of €117 million per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_2908">The number of places on the undergraduate degree programme will be reduced by 310 places. This means that from next year we will be providing 1,570 undergraduate places in the following courses:</p>
            <p eId="para_2909">General Nursing, 860 places</p>
            <p eId="para_2910">Intellectual Disability Nursing, 180 places</p>
            <p eId="para_2911">Psychiatric Nursing, 290 places</p>
            <p eId="para_2912">Midwifery, 140 places (no reduction.)</p>
            <p eId="para_2913">Children's and General Nursing Integrated 100 places (no reduction.)</p>
            <p eId="para_2914">Total, 1570 places</p>
            <p eId="para_2915">The reduction in places which will result in savings of €1.65 million approximately in 2009 and €3.3 million from 2010 onwards will be effected mainly in those areas that are not experiencing nurse shortages.</p>
            <p eId="para_2916">Nurses trained under the apprenticeship and diploma models undertaking part-time degree courses have been able to apply to their employer to have their course fees paid in return for a service commitment to the public health service. This initiative has been in operation since 2001 and was due for completion before now. It will be no longer be available for new entrants from 1 January 2009, resulting in a saving of €2m next year and about €3.8m per annum from 2010 onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2917">Further savings of €1.35m in 2009 will be achieved by reducing places on the various post-registration courses in specialist clinical practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2918">These three cost saving measures will produce savings of €5m in 2009 and €8.45m in future years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2919">The investment in the undergraduate degree programme is a substantial and significant element of health service expenditure. My Department in cooperation with the HSE is initiating a study to review the clinical, educational, contractual and financial arrangements in place for General, Psychiatric and Intellectual Disability pre-registration nursing programmes established in 2002. (The undergraduate Midwifery and Integrated Children's and General nursing programmes are outside the terms of the review as they are relatively new programmes.)</p>
            <p eId="para_2920">The Review will assess the VFM achieved from monies allocated and utilised in the degree programme and will inform the scope for alternative approaches to nurse education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2921">The Review will also provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure under both capital and revenue headings and will provide sound evidence and a critical analysis of the preparation of nurses for practice.  The findings will provide a basis to inform decision makers on the future direction of pre-registration nursing education programmes in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2922">The Review will be carried out in the context of nursing recruitment and retention patterns, future workforce projections and the overarching health service reform agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_2923">There is no evidence that these savings, which represent less than 5% of overall nursing education expenditure, will impair the quality of front-line services in the health system here or that they will lead to higher overtime bills due to a shortage of fully qualified nurses.</p>

            <p eId="para_2925">In 2005 the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform jointly requested the Health Research Board to establish the National Drug Related Deaths Index (NDRDI).  The Index was established to comply with Action 67 of ‘Building on Experience: National Drug Strategy 2001-2008': the Index is a census of drug and alcohol-related deaths and deaths among substance users in Ireland which is one of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addictions key indicators used to measure the consequences of the drug situation.  The NDRDI database combines information from four sources: coronial records; hospital in-patient deaths (collected under the Hospital In-patient Enquiry Scheme); the methadone treatment database (Central Treatment List) and the General Mortality Register.</p>
            <p eId="para_2926">The Health Research Board will publish the first report of the NDRDI tomorrow (6th November 2008).

            <p eId="para_2927">The Health Research Board is currently collecting data for 2006 and 2007: however, data for 2008 are not available — due to a number of procedural issues in the Coroner's process, NDRDI data will always be a year to one and half years in arrears.</p>
            <p eId="para_2928">The publication of this report will mean that, for the first time, we will have accurate data on drug-related deaths and on deaths among drug users.</p>

         her plans in relation to those people over 70 years who will lose their medical cards due to being over the income levels; if an arrangement will be made with health insurance companies to get cover for these individuals; if an arrangement will be made to enable them to be covered for existing conditions rather than waiting for years without insurance cover; if a solution has been reached in view of the judicial decision regarding risk equalisation; and the way the risk equalisation issue will impact on the numbers of older people with private health insurance in terms of the price of their premiums.

            <p eId="para_2945">Following the recent Government decision to withdraw automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over and to raise the means assessment threshold for persons in that age cohort, it is estimated that approximately 5% (20,000) of persons aged 70 and over will no longer qualify for a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_2946">Persons whose income is above the threshold and whose circumstances are such that it would cause them undue hardship to provide medical and surgical services for themselves may be eligible for a medical card at the discretion of the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2947">With regard to private health insurance, under the Open Enrolment Regulations, insurers are entitled to apply waiting periods in respect of health insurance cover.  It is a matter for the insurers to determine whether or not they would apply waiting periods to persons who may previously have had cover, gave it up and now wish to renew it.  I am aware that insurers are sympathetic in such cases.  For example, in the case of the VHI I understand that where a person has a break in cover, it will allow them to renew cover without having to serve any waiting periods arising from the break in cover, provided premiums are paid for the interim period.  It is important to note that in the period since the granting of medical cards to all persons aged 70, the number of people in this age group holding private health insurance cover has increased.</p>
            <p eId="para_2948">On 16 July the Supreme Court found the 2003 Risk Equalisation Scheme to be ultra vires.  Other elements of the regulatory framework including open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating were not affected by the Court's decision.  The Government remains committed to sustaining the principle of community rating in the private health insurance market.  However, a community rated market which is unsupported by some form of risk equalisation mechanism is not sustainable.  I am considering advice provided by the Attorney General, the Health Insurance Authority and the Department's consultant actuaries and will be bringing proposals to Government very shortly.  Over 50% of the population choose to buy private health insurance.  This level of coverage can be attributed to the fact that health insurance is affordable.  It is affordable for all age groups because we have a community rated market.  These are the reasons why we are working to maintain community rating across the market as a key principle of the regulatory framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_2961">The Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, is designed to ensure that nursing home care is affordable for all who need it.  As such, my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, and I expect that the majority of subvented and unsubvented residents in private nursing homes will apply for the scheme upon its introduction.  Thereafter, the scheme will apply to all new entrants to public, voluntary and approved private nursing homes who wish to avail of State support towards nursing home costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2962">The following table sets out the most recently updated estimates of the total number of nursing home residents, the cost of contributions by residents and the cost of financial support by the State in the first 5 years of the Scheme.  The costings take a whole of system approach.  For example, they take account of existing public residents who will continue to pay public long-stay charges towards their care as well as those paying contributions under A Fair Deal.  I would like to emphasise that figures are based on 2009 estimates, including estimated 2009 costs and prices.  As the costings are extremely sensitive to assumptions about price and available capacity, the actual numbers supported under the scheme will be, to a significant degree, contingent upon the prices agreed between private nursing homes and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, and developments in the private nursing home sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_3028">In respect of the health element of the National Disability Strategy, additional funding of €75m was allocated in both 2006 and 2007 and €50m in 2008.  In the 2008 Budget, €50m was provided to the Health Service Executive (HSE) to fund a range of additional services under the Multi Annual Investment Programme for Disability.  Although the commencement of the planned developments in disability services this year had been delayed due to a financial review, I am pleased to inform you that the Executive has informed the Department of Health and Children that it is now in the process of rolling out the planned developments.  The HSE has indicated that due to the delayed start to some of these developments, it expects to spend €33m of the €50m by the end of 2008.  The resulting €17m time related savings were included in this Department's budgetary consolidation measures announced to the House in July 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3029">In Budget 2009, an additional €10m was allocated to the HSE.  The funding for 2009 will provide for 90 additional therapy posts in the disability services area, targeted at children of school going age.</p>
            <p eId="para_3030">With regard to the yearly expenditure incurred to date on the health element of the National Disability Strategy, this is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3251">I propose to take Questions Nos. 248, 250 and 251 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3252">There are already fifteen staff in rented accommodation in Roscrea. The Deputy will be aware that the decentralisation of the Equality Authority to Roscrea was announced by the then Minister for Finance in December 2003. Arising out of the most recent Budget statement from the Minister for Finance on 14 October this year, the review of the decentralisation programme identified a number of projects which were to continue to be progressed at this time, on the basis that those cases were already advanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_3253">In that context it was decided that an additional fifteen posts from the Equality Authority would transfer to Roscrea to join fifteen staff members already working there bringing the numbers serving there up to thirty. In addition, a number of my Department's other decentralisation projects will move ahead in the immediate future. These include the transfer of 186 INIS posts to Tipperary Town and 150 to Roscommon from the Property Regulatory Authority. It is also intended to facilitate the transfer of additional staff from the Equality Tribunal to Portlaoise. All this will result in the transfer out of Dublin of over eight hundred posts which is almost ninety per cent of my Department's overall target numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3254">It is not true to state that no staff have applied to be transferred to the Authority's office in Roscrea. Of the fifteen posts now due to transfer to Roscrea, around half of these posts will be filled by existing staff members, who are currently serving in the Authority and who have been appointed or promoted on the basis that they will work in Roscrea. The remaining posts will be sourced in the normal way from the Central Applications Facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_3255">Decentralisation to Roscrea will inevitably lead to a savings of significant resources for the tax payer particularly in the context of reduced rent costs when compared to the cost of renting expensive city centre accommodation in Dublin.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that the continued success of my Department's decentralisation programme will benefit all those concerned, including  local organisations and individuals, towns and communities and in particular those people who are anxious to live and work in counties Laois, Tipperary and South Offaly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3256">In relation to the matter of integrating administrative and back office facilities between the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission, my Department is currently examining the issues which need to be addressed in order to achieve these efficiencies. These areas are likely to include shared IT and telecommunications facilities as well as office accommodation which is being addressed in the context of the decentralisation to Roscrea of the remaining elements of the Authority.  I also understand that the two organisations themselves have already had initial discussions in order to move matters forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_3261">The context in which financial provision has been made by the Government for the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority for 2009 is as indicated in the Budget Announcement of 14 October 2008.  In both cases, while I accept that reduced budgets will cause some difficulties, I also consider that there is sufficient funding provided in 2009 for these bodies to enable them to discharge their core activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3262">The Value for Money review of the Equality Authority is an analysis of past performance in achieving the tasks set out in its strategic plan to date. The Budget decisions do not pre-empt the outcome of that review.  I would also remind the deputy that the provision in 2009 for the Equality Tribunal — the body which adjudicates on claims of inequality — has been increased by 15%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3263">On a more general level, I should also state that as I indicated in my contribution to the budget debate I had decided that the main priority in the Justice area in 2009 will be tackling crime.  In that regard, decisions about funding reflect that priority with the result that in a small number of areas budgets have been reduced significantly.  Moreover, in line with Government policies generally I have asked all bodies to significantly reduce their spending on consultants, advertising and other non core items.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3282">I propose to take Questions Nos. 259 to 262, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3283">My Department's decentralisation programme has been extremely successful.  Five hundred and fifty posts have moved to office accommodation which has been sourced by the Office of Public Works.  This is sixty per cent of the overall target numbers and the Justice and Equality family now has a presence in all of the seven locations covered by the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3284">The five hundred and fifty staff have been sourced from the Central Applications Facility in accordance with the protocols agreed between staff and management.  This has necessitated the movement of staff both into and out of my Department and its agencies as well as the reassignment of existing staff within the Department. In all cases, this has been managed in a way that ensures that there is no diminution of services to the public.  I would refer the Deputy to my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 368 and 403 of 30 September 2008 and No. 344 of 21 October 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3285">The Deputy will be aware that the bulk of expenditure under the decentralisation programme is in respect of the provision of office accommodation and the associated capital costs and these are a matter for the Office of Public Works.  In terms of non-capital expenditure, to date, my Department has incurred costs of around €2.5 m. in relation to the provision of office equipment, training and I.C.T.  Arising out of the Minister for Finance's recent Budget statement, the review of the decentralisation programme identified priority elements including a number of my Department's projects which are to be progressed at this time.  This will result in the transfer out of Dublin of over eight hundred posts which is almost ninety per cent of my Department's overall target numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3286">The Office of Public Works is responsible for the provision of office accommodation both in Dublin and in the decentralised locations.  That Office is carrying out a rationalisation programme in respect of office accommodation in Dublin which has been freed up as a result of staff relocating under the decentralisation programme.  My Department, along with all Government Departments, will of course collaborate with the OPW in that exercise.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3291">I take it that the Deputy is referring to the legal regime governing the exploration and exploitation of Ireland's continental shelf.</p>
            <p eId="para_3292">The regime governing the exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf in international law is set down by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Under that Convention a coastal state is entitled to a continental shelf 200 nautical miles (approx. 370 km) in breadth regardless of whether its continental shelf physically extends that far, subject only to the similar rights of its coastal neighbours. It may also claim a broader shelf where it can show that the natural prolongation of its land territory under water actually extends beyond that limit. A claim to extended shelf must be supported by scientific and technical data and be established to the satisfaction of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which was created by the Convention for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_3293">Ireland's shelf naturally extends beyond 200 nautical miles both to the west and the south of the country. For the purposes of our claims we have divided our shelf into three sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3294">The first sector is to the south-west of the country on the edge of an area known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. This sector (which is approximately half the size of the State's land territory) is not disputed by any other state and was therefore the subject of Ireland's first submission to the Commission, made in May 2005. Based upon this submission, the Commission issued its recommendations on the limits of this claimed area in April 2007, allowing Ireland to designate an area of extended shelf of up to 39,000 square kilometres. The Government has accepted these recommendations and work is now in hand to designate the additional seabed enclosed by these limits as areas to which the Continental Shelf Act 1968 will apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_3295">The second sector claimed extended continental shelf is in the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay where there are unresolved boundary issues with the UK, France and Spain. This sector was the subject of a joint submission by the four countries in May 2006. It covers an area of approximately 80,000 square kilometres, which is slightly larger than the State's land territory. The joint submission was examined by a sub-commission established to examine the evidence submitted in support of it. The four states met with the sub-commission on a number of occasions, most recently in September. The meeting was positive and the sub-commission has now formulated its draft recommendations. These recommendations have in turn been transmitted to the full Commission and will be considered by it for approval in March 2009. The question of division of the area between the four states concerned will now be considered after the recommendations have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_3296">Ireland also claims continental shelf in the part of the North-East Atlantic Ocean known as the Hatton-Rockall Area, which extends up to 500 nautical miles from the coast. Ireland and the UK agreed a maritime boundary on the continental shelf here in 1988 but this is not accepted by Iceland or Denmark (on behalf of the Færoe Islands), which also make extensive overlapping claims. The four countries have met regularly since 2001 in an effort to resolve the issues arising from overlapping claims but have recently concluded that they are unable to reach agreement at the present time. Nevertheless, the four are keeping the matter under regular review and, in the meantime, Ireland will proceed to make a national submission to the Commission in respect of the Hatton-Rockall Area by the deadline of May 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_3298">The Government is strongly committed to trying to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish in the United States. This remains a key priority and forms an integral part of the ongoing efforts to reform our overall migration arrangements with the US. The agreement reached on 24 September to establish a new Working Holiday Agreement between Ireland and the US is a very positive development in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_3299">I emphasised the Government's strong support for the undocumented during my visit to the US in September. Among the political figures with whom I discussed the matter were the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy; the Chairwoman of the House sub-Committee on Immigration, Zoe Lofgren; Congressman James Sensenbrenner and the House Friends of Ireland Group. While most are generally supportive of our position, they emphasised that passing immigration legislation will continue to present significant challenges for the foreseeable future. In New York, I met with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and announced the allocation of an additional $50,000 to that organisation, bringing total Government funding to the undocumented's main lobby group since 2006 to $235,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3300">I can assure the Deputy that the Government will be prioritising the issue of the undocumented in our early contact with the new US Administration and Congress.</p>

            <p eId="para_3302">The collapse of Ukraine's governing coalition in September and the calling in October of the third parliamentary elections in three years are matters of concern. However, Ukraine is a young democracy and has already travelled a great distance in terms of reform, though clearly further reforms are necessary, including clarifying the roles of the President and the government.</p>
            <p eId="para_3303">The current governmental difficulties have come at a bad time given the present world financial crisis. At the same time, I was encouraged by the fact that all sides buried their political differences in order to ensure the passing of vital legislation last week which will allow Ukraine to receive a $16.5 billion IMF loan to maintain its economic and financial stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3304">At the 9th September EU-Ukraine Summit, the EU reiterated its support for Ukraine's reform efforts and made clear its determination to complete negotiations on a new EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. In the meantime, the EU continues to work with Ukraine on its reform programme, and is exploring ways to further develop links with that country.</p>

            <p eId="para_3307">The most recent ministerial meeting held in the framework of the current round of WTO negotiations ended inconclusively in Geneva on 29 July 2008, although progress was achieved on many of the issues covered by the negotiations. In the end, the breakdown came as a result of disagreement, primarily between the United States and India, on a special safeguard mechanism (SSM) for agricultural producers in developing countries: in effect a mechanism to protect farmers in developing countries from surges in imports of agricultural produce.</p>
            <p eId="para_3308">Ireland had wanted to see an ambitious, fair and balanced outcome to the negotiations, one which would respect Ireland's national interests and reflect adequately the aim of the Doha Development Agenda to give greater prominence to development issues, especially the needs of the poorest developing countries. Ireland regretted the failure to conclude the WTO negotiations and we retain a clear interest in the evolution of fair and sustainable international frameworks to facilitate trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_3309">WTO rule making and multilateral trade liberalisation has had a profound impact on Ireland's development. Against that background, the Government's position with regard to the WTO negotiations has been balanced and consistent: we have always wanted to see a successful outcome, but not at the expense of unfair and unrealistic provisions in respect of agriculture. Ireland's view is that the EU had made very significant contributions to the negotiations and that the other WTO negotiating partners should make equivalent contributions. However, due to a combination of political factors in some major countries, it is most unlikely that the negotiations will be resumed before summer 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_3311">As I stated in the House on 9th October last in reply to a Parliamentary Question, I am deeply concerned about the situation in Afghanistan.</p>
            <p eId="para_3312">The security situation, of course, gives grounds for particular concern. The UN Secretary General concluded in his most recent report on Afghanistan, issued on 23rd September, that the situation deteriorated markedly over the last six months. He noted that the influence of the insurgency had expanded beyond the traditionally volatile areas and had increased in provinces neighbouring Kabul. Incidents stemming from cross-border activities from Pakistan had increased significantly and attacks on aid-related targets and NGOs had become more frequent and more deadly. Tragically, the tactics of the insurgency, as well as military operations, had caused the number of civilian deaths to rise sharply.</p>
            <p eId="para_3313">Casualty figures for the period since the Secretary General's report give no grounds for optimism that the situation is likely to improve in the near future. The suicide attack on the Ministry of Information and Culture in Kabul last week, in which, in addition to the suicide bomber, at least two people were killed, shows the capacity of the insurgency to strike at Government targets in the heart of the capital. The recent killings of foreign aid workers are especially tragic and regrettable and will certainly impact on reconstruction efforts and humanitarian operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3314">The crisis in Afghanistan is further complicated by the security situation in neighbouring Pakistan where Taliban and other foreign militants have been sheltered by regional leaders in areas bordering Afghanistan. As a result, cross-border insurgency from Pakistan into Afghanistan remains a significant problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_3315">One significant and encouraging development, however, is the recent improvement in relations between the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan and their agreement to cooperate to combat cross-border insurgency. I welcome, in particular, the meeting between the Foreign Ministers of the two countries in New York in September in which they reiterated their resolve to fight jointly extremist elements along the Pakistan-Afghan border and the "mini-jirga" tribal meeting in Islamabad last week, where Afghan and Pakistani leaders agreed to cooperate more closely to fight the insurgency on both sides of their common border.</p>
            <p eId="para_3316">One strategy that the mini-jirga agreed to adopt is to begin discussions with the "opposition" understood to mean the Taliban. This could certainly involve risk, but the approach of trying to dissociate the many Taliban members who are not strongly ideological fundamentalists from their hardcore, militant, leadership — leaving the latter more vulnerable to defeat — may be a risk worth taking.</p>

            <p eId="para_3318">With the fifth wave of enlargement, twelve new countries joined the European Union, on 1 May 2004 and 1 January 2007, bringing the total membership from 15 to 27. In addition there are two candidate countries currently engaged in accession negotiations — Croatia and Turkey — and a third candidate country — the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with which negotiations have not yet opened. The European Council at Thessaloniki in 2003 confirmed that the other countries of the Western Balkans have a European perspective, and the EU has reiterated that their future lies in the Union, once they have met the required political and economic standards and carried out the necessary reforms to align themselves with EU law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3319">The accession negotiations with Croatia are proceeding well and the Commission's annual assessment on their preparations for membership will be published today, 5 November. Provided Croatia can maintain the pace of its reform process, it may be able to complete its accession negotiations by the end of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3320">The December 2006 European Council set out the principles governing the EU's approach to enlargement. Firstly, the EU will focus on those countries to which it has already given a prospect of EU membership. Secondly, each step forward by a country in the process depends on that country's own progress in meeting the necessary conditions at each stage of the negotiations. Thirdly, the EU must communicate the realities of enlargement more clearly to EU citizens and must also take account of the EU's capacity to integrate new members. Each country is judged on its own merits, with the pace of the negotiations depending on the results of reforms in the negotiating country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3321">Although some member states, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, would wish to extend a membership perspective to their near neighbours — Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia, such a move is not on the EU's agenda at present. Instead relations with the neighbouring countries of the Union are addressed under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which covers neighbouring countries to the south and east of the EU who do not have a membership perspective. The recent European Council instructed the European Commission to submit proposals for a future "Eastern Partnership" within the ENP to the Council in November.</p>

            <p eId="para_3323">Ireland, together with its EU partners, attaches great importance to achieving stability in the countries of the Western Balkans, including through the European Union's Stabilisation and Association (SAA) process. This process provides the framework for co-operation on economic, political and legal matters and aims to bring countries closer to EU standards and principles. Stabilisation and Association Agreements have now been signed with all the countries in the region with the exception of Kosovo.</p>
            <p eId="para_3324">Recent developments in the Western Balkans have largely focused on Kosovo and the decision of the Kosovo Assembly to declare independence on 17 February 2008.  On 18 February, EU Foreign Ministers agreed a common response to Kosovo's declaration of independence, noting the uniqueness of Kosovo's situation, and reaffirming the EU's willingness to play a leading role in strengthening stability in the region including by means of the planned ESDP rule of law mission, EULEX KOSOVO.</p>
            <p eId="para_3325">It also agreed that Member States would decide, in accordance with national practice and international law, on their relations with Kosovo. Since then, 22 EU Member States, including Ireland, have recognised Kosovo's independence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3326">With the coming into force of the new Kosovo constitution on 15 June, the EU's main aim is to enable a smooth transition from the current UN mission (UNMIK) to the EULEX KOSOVO mission, and to ensure that the international presence can operate effectively throughout Kosovo, including Serb majority areas in the North. The EU is working closely with the UN to achieve this. 234 Irish troops continue to serve in the UN-mandated KFOR peacekeeping force.</p>
            <p eId="para_3327">In recent weeks, there has been detailed discussion of current political developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the need for reinforced EU engagement there. The EU will continue to encourage the Government in Bosnia-Herzegovina to make every effort to focus on its potential for EU membership. The forthcoming General Affairs and External Relations Council, to be held on 10 November, will discuss Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the future of Operation Althea, in which 44 Irish troops continue to serve.</p>

            <p eId="para_3329">The terrible events in the Democratic Republic of Congo in recent weeks, as well as the ongoing situations in Somalia, Darfur and Zimbabwe, serve to remind us that combating both the causes and effects of war, instability, poor governance and hunger in Africa is one of the most important tasks facing the international community in the 21st century.</p>
            <p eId="para_3330">Conflict has many causes and many manifestations, but poverty and inequality have proved to be the most fertile breeding grounds for violence and instability. Most armed conflicts occur in poor countries, and the causes and effect of conflict are exacerbated by poverty and corruption. The risk of strife, famine and unpunished abuses of human rights is greater where political, economic and administrative systems are weak, and Ireland's development co-operation programme focuses on all of these risks. Irish Aid supports specific actions designed to promote political stability, including by strengthening government systems and combating inequality. Irish Aid has a specific focus on governance, including the protection of human rights, in several programme countries. In our dialogue with partners in the EU and the UN, Ireland is a strong advocate for the developing world and for international peace and security.</p>
            <p eId="para_3331">The Government established a Hunger Task Force in 2007, with the aim of identifying the particular contribution that Ireland could make to tackle the root causes of food insecurity, particularly in Africa. The Report of the Hunger Task Force, which was presented at the UN in New York in September 2008, highlighted the continued threat posed by hunger, and made several very concrete recommendations on how this threat can be dealt with.</p>
            <p eId="para_3332">Promoting stability and supporting progress towards peace in Africa requires a huge international effort. UN-authorised peacekeeping missions have a major role in stabilising former and current conflict zones throughout Africa, not least the current EU-led military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR Tchad/RCA, in which the Irish contingent is playing a prominent role. Ireland has a strong tradition of contributing to UN-mandated peace-support missions in Africa. We have also provided support to the UN's Peace Building Fund and have been strongly supportive of the establishment of the Peace Building Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_3333">African leadership and responsibility are crucial in addressing the issues of hunger, war and instability, and the African Union represents an important strategic partner for the European Union. Since 2004, the EU has supported the development of African-led peacekeeping in Darfur and elsewhere through its African Peace Facility. Peace, security, good governance and development were among the themes discussed by European and African leaders at the EU-Africa Summit in December 2007, which agreed a comprehensive EU-Africa Strategy to address these and other common challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_3334">The challenges facing Africa are enormous. But there is some encouraging news. Many African economies are growing. The work of the International Criminal Court, which Ireland strongly supports, marks a real effort to end impunity for war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. While there are tragic exceptions, notably those I have already mentioned, many African countries now have less violence and civil strife than has been the case for many years. There is relative peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Angola, northern Uganda and southern Sudan, although international engagement will be needed for some time. Through our aid programme, Ireland will continue to address issues of poverty, conflict and instability, and to make a real and lasting difference in the lives of many.</p>

            <p eId="para_3336">The current international situation poses very real challenges for the European Union. The Union's agenda at present is dominated by such issues as the international financial crisis, climate change, the Union's role in the world and the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty. The recent European Council dealt with all these issues in a very positive and effective manner. The Union is clearly playing an important leadership role in the global arena, especially in relation to the financial crisis and climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_3337">While I have not detected any significant realignment among the Member States in recent discussions within the European Council and the Council of Ministers, the fact is that all EU policies represent compromises between the Member States and their respective national positions. This is the way in which the EU has always functioned and its success requires openness to compromise on the part of the Member States, mutual goodwill and a commitment to shared objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_3338">The EU's relations with neighbouring countries and regional groups are receiving considerable attention at present. When it comes to the conduct of external relations in a body as large and diverse as the European Union, there will always be issues of particular interest to certain Member States or groups of States, based on the existence of traditional economic and cultural ties with third countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_3339">Last week the EU participated in a Ministerial meeting of the Northern Dimension with the Nordic partners, Norway and Iceland, and with Russia. This week, I attended a Foreign Ministers' meeting of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean, which took place in Marseilles. This meeting involved the EU and countries from the Mediterranean and North Africa and is aimed at reinvigorating the Union's relations with this vital neighbouring region. Later this month, the European Commission will submit to the Council proposals for a future "Eastern Partnership" within the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3340">The Union's role in the world and its relations with third countries and regional groupings is likely to be a matter of continued priority in the years ahead. Indeed, I would remind the House that a key aim of the Lisbon Treaty is to provide greater coherence in the EU's external relations, including through the appointment of a permanent President of the European Council and a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Peter Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_3342">Relations between the EU and Africa are discussed regularly at the monthly meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. The trade and development aspects of the relationship are integral to these discussions, in keeping with the primary objective of the EU's approach to development cooperation — the eradication of poverty in the context of sustainable development. It is clear that the development of trade, both regionally and globally, remains central to the achievement of sustained economic growth for the world's least developed countries, 34 of which are in Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_3343">The EU-Africa Joint Strategy, which was adopted by the EU and 53 African States at a summit meeting in Lisbon last December, marks an important turning point in the relationship. It established a new partnership between the EU and Africa, based on the principles of interdependence, equality and respect, and a joint commitment to peace and stability, poverty reduction and sustainable development.</p>
            <p eId="para_3344">Currently the EU is engaged in the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements with the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. In this context, negotiations are continuing with the four regional African groups of countries. The negotiating mandate derives from the legally-binding 2000 Cotonou Agreement between the EU and the ACP States, the central objective of which is the "reduction and eventual eradication of poverty, consistent with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of the ACP countries into the world economy".</p>
            <p eId="para_3345">The Economic Partnership Agreements will next be discussed by EU Development Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council which I will attend in Brussels on 10-11 November. The discussion will focus on how the Agreements can help build regional integration in Africa, which is critical for increased participation in the international trading system by the world's poorest countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_3346">With our EU partners, the Government also responds to the needs of African and other developing countries in the context of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). While the Commission negotiates on trade matters on behalf of the member States, Ireland has consistently played an important role throughout the current Doha Round of negotiations, in promoting a just and equitable outcome. The relationship with Africa, and the needs of the world's poorest countries, represent a crucially important element in discussions at Ministerial level on the negotiating mandate for the WTO Doha Round.</p>

            <p eId="para_3348">The EU has been involved in conflict resolution efforts in Georgia from the start of the recent crisis and has played a key role in every step which has reduced tensions there. The pledge of assistance made at the 22 October donor reconstruction conference for Georgia, which the EU co-sponsored, will help Georgia to develop economically and rebuild the damage done during the fighting in August.</p>
            <p eId="para_3349">More generally, Georgia's relations with the EU are addressed under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), which is intended to share the European Union's stability, security and prosperity with neighbouring countries to the south and east of the EU. It supports respect for human rights, rule of law, good governance, market economy principles and sustainable development. The ENP remains distinct from the issue of EU membership.</p>
            <p eId="para_3350">Given recent events, further moves to strengthen the relationship were decided at the extraordinary European Council meeting on 1 September. These include the possibility of the negotiation of a visa facilitation agreement and of a free trade agreement. Last month's European Council supported efforts to achieve modernisation and democratisation in eastern neighbourhood countries and instructed that proposals for a future ENP "Eastern Partnership" be submitted by the Commission later this month. Measures to further expand EU-Georgia relations in the economic, social and political spheres are likely to be included in this initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_3351">I look forward to visiting Georgia myself later this month and hope to be in a position to assess how the EU, and Ireland nationally, can best develop relations with Georgia.</p>

            <p eId="para_3353">EU-Russia relations have inevitably been affected by events in Georgia, which have pointed to a new and worrying stance by Russia in relation to its right to intervene to protect its interests and citizens. Both Russia and EU Member States must abide by the international standards they have themselves signed up to through the UN, OSCE and Council of Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_3354">However, the EU and Russia share important economic, political and security interests and will remain interdependent and essential partners on many issues, including international matters such as Iran and North Korea. The EU accounts for over half of all Russian exports and provides most of the foreign direct investment in Russia. The bilateral relationship is also reflected in the energy sector, where the EU imports a third of its gas and a quarter of its oil from Russia. The EU remains open to developing its strategic relationship with Russia on the basis of mutual respect and regard for common values.</p>
            <p eId="para_3355">An in-depth evaluation of EU-Russian relations was called for in advance of the next scheduled EU-Russia Summit on 14 November. This evaluation will be discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council next Monday, 10 November. Both the evaluation and developments on Georgia will be taken into account in deciding whether to lift the suspension, originally agreed at the 1 September extraordinary European Council, on negotiations for a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Russia.</p>

            <p eId="para_3357">I am very concerned at the continuing deterioration of the situation in the DRC which is worsening an already grave humanitarian crisis.

            <p eId="para_3368">I propose to take Questions Nos. 280, 285 and 286 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3369">The results of the comprehensive independent research, commissioned by the Government, which were published in September, confirmed that our people want Ireland to continue to be fully involved in the Union. Seventy per cent of Irish people agree that membership is a good thing, while just eight per cent disagreed. In that sense, the referendum result cannot be described as an expression of anti-EU sentiment. Ireland remains one of the countries most positively disposed to membership of the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_3370">It is evident, however, that many voters had genuinely-held concerns regarding aspects of the Treaty and these must be addressed. Between now and the December European Council, the Government will work closely with the EU Presidency, the other Member States and with the Union's institutions, with a view to defining the elements of a solution which will deal with Irish concerns and also be acceptable to our EU partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_3371">Our determination to ensure that Ireland remains at the heart of the European Union has been strengthened in light of the recent global economic and financial upheavals. Our membership of the Union, and particularly the support our financial system received from the European Central Bank, were vital in securing our national position. In the absence of these stabilising factors, the experience of other countries suggests that Ireland could well have encountered far greater difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3372">It is clear that an element of Euro scepticism exists in most Member States. This is to be expected in open pluralist democracies like ours. However, there is no future for Ireland in aligning ourselves with marginal Euro sceptical elements across the Union. Our best interests will be served by remaining at the heart of the Union and working closely with countries that share our values and aspirations. The Government is firmly of the view that Treaty-based arrangements between sovereign States offer the best guarantee that the interests of small countries will be protected and advanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_3373">Ireland has always been strongly opposed to any concept of a two-speed Europe and that continues to be the case. The other EU Member States share this view. Any such development would not be good for Ireland nor for the Union as a whole. That is why there is such determination across the Union to arrive at a solution with regard to the Lisbon Treaty that all 27 Member States can endorse.</p>

            <p eId="para_3375">At present, the Treaties make no provision for the withdrawal of a State from the Union. Under the Lisbon Treaty, if ratified, this however would change, as explicit provision is made there for withdrawal.</p>
            <p eId="para_3376">The withdrawal of any country from the Union would have a profound impact, including on foreign trade. Such a move would require a country to re-negotiate the terms of its external trading relationships not only with the Union, but also with individual countries, such as China, the US and India. This would pose very major difficulties, especially of course for a small country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3377">I believe, in this overall context, that it is important to stress that it is the strong position of all EU Member States that their place is at the heart of Europe, a view which in Ireland's case was emphatically confirmed by the recent research of people's views commissioned by the Government and published in September.</p>

            <p eId="para_3381">While there is no appetite among Member States for a renegotiation of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU always works on the basis of accommodating the interests of all Member States. It has in particular an admirable record of consistently finding satisfactory solutions to challenging issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_3382">From discussions with EU counterparts, it is clear that there is a strong desire among other Member States to find ways of accommodating Ireland. Our task in the period ahead will be to translate this general willingness to address Irish concerns into commitments that all Member States can endorse. It is, of course, strongly in our interest, including in the context of the current global economic and financial uncertainty, to find a solution that will fully protect Ireland's position within the Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_3383">Between now and the December European Council, the Government will work closely with the Presidency, the other Member States and the Union's institutions in the search for a solution that will serve Ireland's economic, political and wider interests in the years ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_3385">The Government are aware of the sensitivities surrounding the timetable for the coming year as it relates to the European elections which are due to be held in June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3386">In Brussels on 6 October, I addressed a plenary session of the European Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee on the Lisbon Treaty.

            <p eId="para_3391">To date, the Treaty of Lisbon has been ratified by twenty-two Member States, with ratification awaited by Germany, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Poland. Two of these states have already completed their parliamentary procedures. It is anticipated that by January next year, Ireland may well be the only State not to have ratified the Treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_3392">It is clear that the concerns expressed by the Irish people on 12 June this year need to be addressed. Similarly, there is an equally strong desire among our EU partners to see the Treaty ratified. There is, I should emphasise, great willingness on the part of other Member States to work actively with us in the search for a solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3393">The Government have always been firmly opposed to any idea of a two-speed Europe and this continues to be the case. The other Member States share this view. Such a development would not be good for Ireland nor for the Union as a whole. That is why there is such determination across the Union to arrive at a solution on the Lisbon Treaty that all 27 Member States can endorse.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3395">As I have stated recently in the House, the situation in Burma remains of major concern. There has been a conspicuous absence of political progress since the events of September 2007, and repression by the military of monks, political activists and others continues. In May, the military junta pressed ahead with a fundamentally flawed referendum on a new Constitution for Burma. At the same time, they also extended the detention order on Aung San Suu Kyi for a further six months. I immediately condemned this action and renewed the Government's call for her release.</p>
            <p eId="para_3396">The Burmese regime has also failed to engage seriously with the UN Secretary General's Special Representative, Dr Ibrahim Gambari. This is gravely disappointing. The Government continues to support actively the work of the Secretary General, his Special Representative, the UN's Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Burma and the UN Rapporteur on Human Rights. I believe the role of the Secretary General personally is vital if the goals of democratisation and national reconciliation in Burma are to be achieved. In this regard, I believe that every effort must be made by the international community to ensure that the elections that the Burmese regime has promised for 2010 will be free, fair and fully inclusive, and likewise the process leading up to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_3397">Ireland remains committed to helping the Burmese people in their struggle for justice, democracy and development. In pursuit of this goal, the Government has engaged in diplomatic activity at Ministerial and senior official level with Burma's neighbours and in international fora. I welcome in this regard the fact that the recent Asia-Europe (ASEM) Summit, which the Taoiseach attended, adopted a very positive position on the Burmese situation. The support of countries in the Asia region is crucial to a resolution of the problems in Burma.</p>
            <p eId="para_3398">During my visit to the UN in September, I raised the situation in Burma in the course of discussions with senior UN officials and with the Foreign Minister of Indonesia, who is also deeply concerned about the situation there. The Government has also worked to enhance the EU's role in supporting the people of Burma, including securing the extension of EU sanctions against the regime in December 2007. I will be discussing the situation in Burma with other EU Foreign Ministers when I travel to Brussels next week for the General Affairs and External Relations Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_3399">The humanitarian situation following Cyclone Nargis is still very difficult but, thanks to facilitation efforts by the UN and ASEAN and the generous response of the international community, the Burmese people most affected are being actively assisted in their recovery efforts. In this regard, over €1.35 million in Irish Aid funding was provided to the emergency relief effort, as well as two airlifts of essential humanitarian supplies from our pre-positioned emergency stockpiles in Brindisi, Italy and in the Curragh.</p>
            <p eId="para_3400">We have also provided support to Burma's government in exile — the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB), to civil society groups in Burma and to the Burma advocacy group, Burma Action Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_3408">I propose to take Questions Nos. 290 to 292, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3409">Under the Government's decentralisation programme announced in 2003, 125 posts attached to the Development Co-operation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs were to decentralise to Limerick. The Division is the Headquarters of Irish Aid. Following sanction of an additional 20 posts by the Department of Finance in 2005, the total number of posts attached to Irish Aid Headquarters increased to 145. Of these, 138 are transferring to Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_3410">The decentralisation of Irish Aid has not been postponed due to budgetary considerations. No expenditure has therefore been incurred in respect of a deferred decentralisation project. Currently 95 staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs are working in interim office accommodation in Limerick City. The decentralisation of Irish Aid will be completed next week, when staff move into a new headquarters building in the city. The Office of Public Works has sourced the permanent office accommodation for Irish Aid in Limerick. They have stated that the floor space measures approximately 4,300 square metres, with capacity to accommodate a total of 170 staff, to allow for any future expansion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3411">Of the 108 staff assigned to Irish Aid at the time decentralisation was announced, 17%, or 18 officials, were transferred to other areas of the Department or to other Departments as a direct result of decentralisation. It is in the nature of the work of the Department that staff transfer between Divisions at HQ, and indeed to Embassies abroad, on a regular basis. This routine rotation accounts for the balance of the staff transfers from Irish Aid. While a small number of specialist or technical staff have left Irish Aid in recent years, none has done so as a direct result of decentralisation. Of the 18 officials transferred as a direct result of decentralisation, 6 were at Assistant Principal Officer level or higher.</p>

The Department, which has a staff of 130, was designated an "early mover" by the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG).</p>
            <p eId="para_3429">To date, 79 members of staff, who opted not to relocate to Killarney, have been released through bilateral swaps and under the Dublin Arrangements to other Departments and Offices. Of these, 36 members of staff were at a managerial level i.e. Higher Executive Officer and above.</p>
            <p eId="para_3430">Some 76 members of staff have relocated to temporary accommodation in Fossa, Killarney. Of these, 37 staff are at a managerial level i.e. Higher Executive Officer and above.</p>
            <p eId="para_3431">The temporary accommodation in Fossa, has a total area of approximately 1,100 square meters. An area of approximately 830 square meters of office space has been vacated in Dublin while an area of approximately 1,100 square meters of office space is still being occupied by Department staff in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_3432">The objective is to complete the decentralisation process of the Department by early 2009 by which time it will be operating from the new purpose built offices in Killarney, which has a total area of approximately 2,400 square meters. It will be necessary to retain some facilities for use by staff in Dublin to service the Minister and the Oireachtas, particularly when the Dail is in session, but the space for such facilities has yet to be determined.</p>
            <p eId="para_3433">The decentralisation of three State Agencies, under the aegis of the Department — the Arts Council, the Irish Sports Council and Fáilte Ireland — has been deferred pending a review in 2011. No capital expenditure has been incurred by these agencies in respect of decentralisation. Some minor current expenditure has been incurred related mainly to travel expenses on visits to the proposed decentralised locations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3446">I propose to take Questions Nos. 304 to 307, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3447">My reply relates only to matters which are the direct responsibility of my Department and does not cover matters in relation to property acquisition or property disposal, as these are issues for the Office of Public Works.</p>
            <p eId="para_3448">As the Deputy will be aware, the decentralisation of my Department's Headquarters to Charlestown, Co. Mayo, has not been deferred. To date, 100 staff have moved to temporary accommodation in Tubbercurry, where they currently occupy some 1,560 sq metres of space. There is full capacity in Tubbercurry at present and it is intended to move the remaining staff when the new Headquarters building in Charlestown is completed at end-2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3449">My Department has now fulfilled its commitments in relation to decentralisation at Na Forbacha, Co. Galway. 11 staff have decentralised there, who are housed in an extension to the existing building in that location.</p>
            <p eId="para_3450">In relation to bodies or agencies that come within the ambit of the Department, I can confirm that the further decentralisation of Pobal to Clifden, Co. Galway, has been deferred and will be considered further in 2011. 25 staff have already moved to temporary accommodation in Clifden, where the floor area is 350 sq meters. There is capacity for 29 staff in the current building. A total of €222,943 has been spent to date on that temporary accommodation and no other costs have been incurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_3451">In relation to Foras na Gaeilge, 5 posts were approved recently to relocate to Gaoth Dobhair, Co Donegal, and the decentralisation of a further 25 posts will be further considered in due course in the North/South framework and in the context of the planned review in 2011.  No capital or current costs have been incurred to date in relation to the decentralisation of Foras na Gaeilge. The issue of interim accommodation for the 5 Foras staff is being pursued with the Office of Public Works and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</p>
            <p eId="para_3452">In relation to the decentralisation programme to Tubbercurry/Charlestown and the number of staff moves that have been necessitated, I can confirm that 95 staff moved into my Department and 79 transferred out of it, either by way of bilateral transfers, transfers under the Dublin arrangements or by decentralising to other Departments. The remaining staff resigned, retired or transferred on promotion.  Some 17 of the moves involved managerial grades and 4 are technical/professional. There have been 5 staff moves in relation to Na Forbacha, none in managerial grades and one Technical/Professional.</p>
            <p eId="para_3453">Of the 25 staff that were relocated to Clifden, these were recruited for that location. 2 of the staff in question are managerial and the remainder are technical/administrative. There have been no staff moves to date in relation to Foras na Gaeilge.  The matter of vacating buildings in Dublin as a result of the decentralisation programme will be a matter for the Office of Public Works.</p>

            <p eId="para_3455">This issue was the subject of a High Court judgment concerning the rights of a person, who has undergone gender reassignment surgery, to recognition of her acquired gender.  On foot of a High Court judgement, delivered on 19 October 2007, the judge made a declaration, pursuant to Section 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, that Sections 25, 63 and 64 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 are incompatible with the obligations of the State under the European Convention on Human Rights by reason of their failure to respect the private life of the Applicant, as required by Article 8 of the Convention, in that there are no provisions which would enable the acquired gender identity of the Applicant to be legally recognised in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_3456">This is the first time that the High Court has made a declaration of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of a provision of Irish law.  As such, the High Court judgment is very significant and raises complex and far-reaching issues, not merely for this case but for future cases under the European Convention on Human Rights Act. The judgment has implications for a wide range of legislative and policy areas including taxation, social welfare, pensions, family law, criminal law, equality, employment, sport, financial services, health, education and so on. In that context, it is essential to obtain the confirmation of the Supreme Court that the judgment was warranted and to seek clarity on all its implications.  As the judgment is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court, it is not considered appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</p>

Under these arrangements, which reflect the findings of a study commissioned from the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute (INDI) in 2006 on healthy eating, diabetes is not classified as a prescribed diet but rather comes within a healthy eating diet which a person can meet from their basic social welfare or HSE payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_3483">In addition, the Department has decentralised offices in Longford, Sligo, Letterkenny, Waterford, Dundalk and Roscommon and some 219 employees have transferred to these offices and other offices of the Department to fill vacancies created by the current decentralisation programme.  Furthermore, a total of 258 employees of the Department have transferred to other Government Departments for the purposes of their decentralisation programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3484">The Government outlined in Budget 2009 that the decentralisation programme to Buncrana and Drogheda would proceed as planned.  A site in Buncrana has been purchased, the building is under construction and the expected completion date of the project is late 2009.  The OPW has purchased sites in Drogheda to accommodate the Department's Headquarters and the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_3485">As outlined in Budget 2009, the Government has reviewed the Decentralisation Programme in light of the changed economic circumstances and the deterioration in public finances.  The remaining elements of the programme for this Department have been deferred pending a review in 2011 in light of the budgetary developments.</p>

            <p eId="para_3497">The Department of Social and Family Affairs has a pivotal role in providing income support for people with disabilities who may not be in a position to provide for themselves.  In 2006, spending on income support, to some 248,000 recipients of disability or caring related social welfare schemes, was in excess of €2.38 billion.  In 2007 disability expenditure of €2.62 billion benefited some 246,000 recipients while in 2008, 264,000 recipients were supported by a disability spend of €2.8 billion.  Over €3 billion is being provided in Disability expenditure for 2009.  In addition, people with disabilities may also benefit from other schemes such as state pensions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3500">The consolidation of the Defence Forces formations into a smaller number of locations is a key objective of the White Paper on Defence.  The dispersal of personnel over an extended number of locations is a major impediment to essential collective training.  It also imposes increased and unnecessary overheads on the Defence Forces in terms of barrack management, administration, maintenance and security.  The consolidation process is designed to facilitate higher training standards, while also freeing up under-utilised resources and personnel for operational duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3501">The funding previously realised from the disposal of surplus barracks and properties has, together with pay savings, provided some of the resources required for infrastructure, training-area development and equipment procurement.  In this regard, the White Paper states: "the thrust of the Government decisions in the White Paper is based on their recognition of the necessity to enhance the equipment and infrastructure available to the Defence Forces".</p>
            <p eId="para_3502">The withdrawal of the British Army deployments coupled with reduced paramilitary activity following the Good Friday Agreement has removed the rationale for having seven barracks/posts along the border.  These will now be consolidated into three posts.  Lifford Barracks is one of four military posts along the border being consolidated.  These closures will progress the achievement of the vision of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_3503">There are 120 military personnel and 2 civilian personnel employed in Lifford Barracks.  Based on previous experience it is anticipated that the impact on the local community will be negligible on the basis that most of the personnel serving in this installation live in the area and will probably continue to do so in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3504">The current plan has been put together in close consultation and cooperation with the Defence Forces General Staff.  It provides an overall package that will serve the needs of the Defence Forces into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_3521">The Deputy will be aware that the Government decision on decentralisation provides for the transfer of my Department's Dublin-based civil service staff, together with a number of military personnel, to Newbridge, Co. Kildare and for the decentralisation of Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ) to the Curragh.  I am pleased to confirm that both projects are going ahead as planned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3522">The number of posts to be relocated to Newbridge is approximately 200 civil servants and 43 military personnel.  A further 410 military personnel will decentralise to the new Defence Forces Headquarters at the Curragh.</p>
            <p eId="para_3523">No members of staff have moved to these locations to date.  Construction of the building in Newbridge is underway and the Office of Public Works (OPW) have advised that the building will be completed by December 2009.  To date close to 90% of clerical/administrative civil service staff are in place in preparation for the move to Newbridge.  All staff will move to Newbridge together when the building is completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3524">In relation to the decentralisation of DFHQ, a State owned site for the new building has been identified in the Curragh.  The timescale for completion of the project will be determined by the outcome of the proposed tender competition that is currently being prepared by OPW.  It is expected that tenders will be invited in the near future.  Military personnel will move from Dublin to the new building when it is completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3525">Site acquisition, building construction and fit-out costs for both these projects are borne on the OPW Vote.  Property in Dublin vacated as a result of decentralisation is also a matter for the OPW.  When the transfer to both Newbridge and the Curragh is complete, my Department expects to release properties at Infirmary Road and Glasnevin to the OPW for disposal and/or reallocation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3537">I do not believe it would be appropriate, at the outset, to set definitive limitations on the period of operation of the Home Choice loan scheme or for the total loan finance to be made available, as the timing of the termination of the scheme will be dependent on a range of issues, particularly the extent to which the credit crunch eases and mortgage finance becomes more readily available from the financial institutions. However, the scope of the scheme's operation will be limited by a range of conditions, including the limitations to first-time buyers and new-build homes, and the maximum loan limit of €285,000. This is in line with the Government's stated policy objective of only intervening in the housing market in a very targeted manner. In addition, the level of interest in the scheme, and the numbers and value of loan drawdowns will be kept under close and regular review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3551">The Government announcement on 14 October 2008 confirmed that the decentralisation of my Department's Headquarters to Wexford (270 posts) will proceed as planned.  However the transfer of posts to the three other locations in the South East — Waterford (225 posts), New Ross (125 posts) and Kilkenny (62 posts) — is being deferred pending the outcome of a review in 2011 in light of budgetary developments.</p>

            <p eId="para_3553">Under the Government's decentralisation programme, 206 staff have transferred into my Department in order to decentralise to the South East — Wexford, Kilkenny, New Ross and Waterford.  Of these, 188 were general administrative staff and 18 professional/technical staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_3554">Some 78 staff have transferred out of my Department to other decentralising Departments and 63 staff have transferred out to Departments remaining in Dublin.  Vacancies arising in posts transferring to one of my Department's four locations in the South East have been filled by staff wishing to decentralise to the South East and also through a series of internal staff moves.</p>
            <p eId="para_3555">My Department's Headquarter offices in Wexford are under construction, and expected to be completed by December 2008 and ready for occupation from February 2009.  My Department will then transfer 270 posts into these offices commencing in Q1 2009.   An advance office was established in Wexford on 25 June 2007 and is currently staffed by 43 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_3556">The total floor area of the advance office is 495 sq. metres and accommodates approx 45 staff.  The total floor area for the Wexford Headquarter offices currently under construction is 4,847 sq. metres and will accommodate 270 people.</p>

            <p eId="para_3596">Much of Sectoral Plan covering the activities of the Department and its Agencies, under the National Disability Act 2005, involves fully integrating the needs of persons with disabilities into policy, legislative and operational matters within the Department's remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3597">In addition, matters relating to the National Disability Strategy and to serving the needs of persons with disabilities are mainstreamed, within the Department's remit, as an integral part of operational expenditure on such issues as health and safety and building configuration and maintenance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3598">For these reasons it is not possible to fully disaggregate expenditure on elements of these activities which relate to disability.  Where it has been possible to disaggregate the data, I can advise the Deputy that expenditure since 2005 is set out as follows. I would emphasise that because of the critical need to integrate as much as possible of disability related activity into core functions the following costs represent the small portion of actual spend which is separately identifiable.</p>

This reflects the value I place on a scheme that meets environmental imperatives and consumer demands for environmentally friendly food production.  The provision for REPS in 2009 will be increased to €355million.  I am committed to the long-term future of REPS as a measure that has brought great benefits not only to farmers but also to the community as a whole.</p>

            <p eId="para_3794">The issue referred to arises from the implementation of the EU Habitats and Wild Birds Directives, which is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_3795">Destocking as set out in the Commonage Framework Plans was implemented in Ireland in 2003.  In the light of scientific assessment, in subsequent years, of the condition of one Special Protection Area (SPA) in County Mayo and two Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) in County Galway, it was deemed necessary to implement additional grazing restrictions in order to address continuing overgrazing in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3796">Following discussions with farmers and their representatives in which officials of my Department took part, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has implemented new grazing regimes that go beyond the destocking requirements set out in the original Commonage Framework Plan.  Under these arrangements, each farmer is allocated a grazing entitlement to the commonage proportionate to his or her share and the condition and habitat composition of the commonage.  In some cases this will lead to additional destocking in overgrazed areas, where the farmer has insufficient land in suitable condition to sustain current flock numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3797">This model is applied in those areas where the recovery from overgrazing is very poor and compensation has been agreed with the farming organisations.  Monitoring of the condition of commonage in other parts of the country will be used to assess whether similar interventions are required elsewhere.</p>

The Department awaits confirmation from the Office of Public Works (OPW) of the timescale for delivery of the building in Portlaoise. OPW announced last December that a consortium, the Macquarie Partnership, has won the tender for the project to build the permanent offices in Portlaoise (as part of a public private partnership including offices in Mullingar and Carlow) and planning permission for the new building was granted earlier this year.

Nuair atá na riachtanais go léir comhlíonta ag na hiarratasóirí, agus nuair atá a gcuid cáilíochtaí aitheanta ag an gComhairle Múinteoireachta, féadann iarratasóirí cur isteach ar aitheantas mar mhúinteoirí bunscoile nó iarbhunscoile.</p>

Le linn na tréimhse seo, bítear ag súil go bhfaighidh na múinteoirí seo a gcáilíocht sa Ghaeilge.

Ina measc siúd, bhí an cinneadh gan leanúint leis an deontas a íoctaí do mhúinteoirí a chuaigh faoi oiliúint thar lear i leith freastail ar chúrsaí sa Ghaeltacht.  B'íocaíocht aon uaire de €431 in aghaidh an mhúinteora a íoctaí mar dheontas le múinteoirí a chuaigh faoi oiliúint thar lear agus iad ag freastal ar chúrsaí sa Ghaeltacht.

            <p eId="para_3900">The Redress Board's primary function is to provide financial redress to persons who, as children, were abused while resident in Industrial Schools, Reformatories or other institutions that were subject to State regulation or inspection.</p>
            <p eId="para_3901">The closing date for receipt of applications was the 15th December 2005 by which time the Board had received 14,513 applications. The Board has received a total of 14,549 applications (including 36 late applications accepted up to 31st December 2007).</p>
            <p eId="para_3902">Up to 3rd November 2008, 12,280 applications were processed by the Board. The overall average award from the inception of the scheme is €64,892. Awards are determined by the Board having regard to the severity of the abuse, the severity of physical and psychological injury and the loss of opportunity resulting from the abuse. The level of awards range in value from €0 to €300,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3903">Expenditure associated with the Redress Board to the end of 2007 was €745,591,963. Based on the total number of applications received, the final cost of the scheme may be in the region of €1.1 billion, including legal and administration costs. Any estimate of the final cost of the Scheme at this point will be tentative as the Board has approximately 2,269 applications to process and the level of award provided in these remaining cases may vary substantially.</p>
            <p eId="para_3904">With approximately 2,269 cases to be processed, it is difficult to say at this point when the Board will have completed its work. However, from experience, as the Board generally clears between 200 to 220 cases per month, an estimated  timeframe is 14 months or towards the end of 2009. While the processing of awards should be completed in 2009, there will be some residual work to be completed by the Board in 2010.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3908">I propose to take Questions Nos. 359, 386 and 387 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3909">The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and ensure sustainability in the long term.  In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be entirely spared.  I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level.  However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging international economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_3910">With regard to the removal of certain support services grants received by Protestant fee-charging schools, I wish to re-emphasise that the Protestant Block grant remains in place.  Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will continue to receive, this grant, which amounts to €6.25 million in the current school year.  This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.  It is distributed by the Secondary Education Committee among needier Protestant children.  Applications are made by parents to the Central Protestant Churches Authority, which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.  The retention of this grant demonstrates the importance that I, and this Government, continue to attach to ensuring that students of the Protestant faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.</p>
            <p eId="para_3911">In retaining this grant, the Government is being faithful to the separate arrangements that were agreed with the Protestant schools when the free scheme was introduced by Donagh O'Malley and, at the time, it was the payment of the block grant in particular for Protestant fee-charging schools that distinguished them from those Catholic schools that chose to continue to charge fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_3912">It is estimated that savings of €2.8 million will accrue to my Department as a result of the withdrawal of support services grants from Protestant fee-charging schools in 2009.  It is important to note that the purpose of these grants was not to offset fees for disadvantaged Protestant students.  Rather, they covered a range of support services.  I have had to take decisions on a number of grants that have impacted on the funding of schools generally.  With the Protestant Block grant protected, I can see no justification for treating the Protestant fee-charging schools in a special way, particularly given that Catholic fee-charging schools have not been in receipt of the grants in question at all.</p>
            <p eId="para_3913">With regard to the change in the pupil teacher ratio, it is important to emphasise that this applies to all fee-paying schools, regardless of denominational ethos.  There is an inescapable fact that pay constitutes the bulk of current expenditure on education, and therefore measures impacting on the teaching resources available to schools were necessary.  The specific measures I have had to take in relation to the staffing schedule have to be seen in this light.  I had to take a measured and balanced view of what was reasonable in the circumstances.  Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching timetable and subject options having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of the approved normal staffing allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3914">A school authority may, however, encounter unanticipated difficulty in meeting essential curricular commitments to pupils within the normal staffing allocation.  As part of the normal flexibility in the allocation system, my Department will, on an exceptional basis, consider requests by a school authority for a staffing concession as short-term support.  Such curricular concession applications should clearly demonstrate how the management authority has engaged in effective school planning and inter-school cooperation, where appropriate, to demonstrate how it will deal with the matter in the medium term.</p>
            <p eId="para_3915">Mechanisms are in place for schools that wish to appeal their staffing allocations.  The criteria for appeals are published by my Department and appeals are considered by an Appeals Board which operates independently of my Department.  The positions of individual schools, including those referred to by the Deputies, will not be known until the staffing and budgetary allocations are finalised in the New Year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3917">The statutory framework for the student maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants to assist students to attend full-time third-level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3918">Clause 1, 1.1 of the Higher Education Grants Scheme defines an approved course as a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in one of the approved institutions listed at Appendix 1 (A) and 1 (B) of the scheme.   Distance learning courses do not meet this definition.</p>

            <p eId="para_3993">I am aware of the concerns referred to by the Deputy.   The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.</p>
            <p eId="para_3994">We are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty. The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very difficult decisions in the national interest. In doing this we have attempted to afford some shelter to the education sector but given the scale of public expenditure on education it is simply not possible to avoid tough decisions. I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the country. I have called for cooperation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3995">I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

         the reason there will be further delays in rolling out the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004; the deadline for the full implementation of the Act; if he will expedite the full implementation of the Act; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_4001">The Deputy will be aware that a significant number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 have been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs. Specifically, the following sections have been commenced — 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 53.</p>
            <p eId="para_4002">As I have outlined previously, it is not possible to commence the EPSEN Act incrementally by age cohort, therefore the provisions of the Act especially those regarding assessments and individual education plans will have to be commenced for all children at the same time. This means that the necessary training arrangements, personnel and systems have to be in place at the time of commencement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4003">As required under the Act, the NCSE provided a report making recommendations regarding the implementation of EPSEN which suggested additional investment over a period of years of up to €235m per annum across the education and health sectors. Having considered the NCSE report, and consulted with the education partners, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE, my Department identified a range of options for the implementation of EPSEN.  My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.  In the light of the current financial circumstances, it is therefore not possible to proceed with full implementation in 2010 as originally envisaged. However, the Government will keep the matter under review and is committed to the full implementation of EPSEN at the earliest possible date.</p>
            <p eId="para_4004">I want to reiterate that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. I intend to build on the progress that has been achieved in recent years which has seen a huge increase  in resources for special educational needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents and children, and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs.  As announced on  Budget day, an additional €20m has been provided — €10m for education services and €10m for health services — to strengthen and enhance services, and continue the preparation for the full implementation of the Act at a later date.</p>

            <p eId="para_4017">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  Among those decisions was to advance the withdrawal of supports from non DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.  The main focus of Social Inclusion Measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4018">In terms of language support the budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.  However, the ongoing requirement for current levels of language support teachers in schools should also start to reduce in line with lower levels of immigration and in line with improvements in the levels of proficiency of those pupils for whom this resource has been available.</p>
            <p eId="para_4019">As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment.  This will be done on a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4020">The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and existing provision is not rolled over automatically.  Schools will be applying afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year, based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any new pupils they are enrolling.</p>
            <p eId="para_4021">In terms of the staffing implications at individual school level, the allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4028">I propose to take Questions Nos. 376 and 377 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4029">The level of funding for rented accommodation in 2009 will be finalised later in the year but will be met from my Department's overall allocation in the budget.  The capital allocation of €581m in 2009, although a slight reduction over the 2008 allocation, represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the wider climate in which the 2009 Budget has been framed is very different to that of recent years.  The Government has been faced with very difficult choices across all areas of public spending.  This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of pressure on the Government finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of this Government to investing in the school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4030">The capital programme comprises a number of component elements or sub programmes.  These include Large Scale Building Projects (new school buildings and major extensions/refurbishments); Emergency Works; Site Acquisitions; Remediation Programmes (asbestos removal, radon mitigation); Furniture and Equipment; provision of Temporary Accommodation etc.  It is also my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4031">The level of funding available to each sub programme has not yet been finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_4033">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.</p>
            <p eId="para_4034">Prudent management of the Government finances is particularly important at this time of global economic uncertainty when tax revenue has fallen so significantly and when world economic conditions are so serious.  Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4035">The Government's commitment to education is clear both from its track record over the past decade in providing substantial additional resources, most notably extra teachers to meet previously unmet needs and from the programme the Government set for itself when it came into office.  A lot has changed in the past year and the first and foremost imperative is that we stabilise the public finances.  It is only by doing so that we can shelter gains made and put ourselves in the position of being able to make improvements in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_4036">The specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to the detailed staffing allocation of the school in question for the academic year 2009/10 cannot be determined until the allocation process has fully concluded.  There is nothing exceptional in this.  The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  At primary level the final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4037">Schools are currently returning data to my Department in relation to their enrolment as of 30 September.  My Department has commenced processing this data although all schools have not yet made their returns.  The allocation processes including notification to schools will commence early in the New Year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4044">The selection and enrolment of pupils in second-level schools is the responsibility of the school management authorities.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking second level places in an area.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_4045">Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.</p>
            <p eId="para_4046">Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student.  Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.  Only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_4047">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>
