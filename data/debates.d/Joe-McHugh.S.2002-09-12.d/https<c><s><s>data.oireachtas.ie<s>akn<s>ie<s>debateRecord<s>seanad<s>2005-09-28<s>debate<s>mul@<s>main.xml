          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Coghlan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide an update on the situation regarding the intended future usage of Killarney House and the immediate vicinity thereof, particularly the gardens; and if he will now commit in the short term to the absolutely necessary restoration work.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Glynn of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that funding to complete the entire project at Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital, Mullingar, is provided and when the entire project will be completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide school transport for pupils in the Clarina and Ballybrown areas to the Salesian College, Pallaskenry, County Limerick, in accordance with precedent which has been established.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement in respect of phase 2B of Mullingar hospital, following on her instruction to the Health Service Executive to delay the development of the new facilities at the hospital which is the only acute hospital from Dublin to Sligo; the completion of which is imperative for the provision of an equitable health service for the people of Longford and Westmeath.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for Finance to clarify the basis on which mobile phone companies charge VAT at the Irish rate on calls outside the State.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12">The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the estimated number of persons working in Ireland who are certified as non-resident for tax purposes, and the estimated loss of potential tax revenue due to current non-residency rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I have also received notice from Senator Kenneally of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14">The implications for Kilmeaden, County Waterford, as a result of the decision of Glanbia to close the local cheese factory.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I regard the matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected those raised by Senators Coghlan, Glynn and Finucane which will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_19">I welcome colleagues back after the summer recess and look forward to a very vigorous and intense session between now and Christmas. Fine Gael unreservedly welcomes the statement this week by General de Chastelain of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning in respect of the decommissioning of IRA weapons. This is an historic development and is something we should all welcome. It has been a key aspect not only of every Government since the foundation of the State, but also a key aspect of the Good Friday Agreement, that the gun be taken out of Irish politics. We need to congratulate all concerned. The statement made yesterday by the Ulster Unionist Party also needs to be congratulated, as it has shown good leadership on this matter, unlike others. In the new segregationist politics of Sinn Féin and the DUP in Northern Ireland, it is often difficult for good authority to be recognised. I want to put on the record that the UUP did a great service to the peace process yesterday in unreservedly accepting the accounts of General de Chastelain and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">There are other issues to be resolved and one of them is the motion that is before the House this evening, on which I would welcome all-party support. If the Government attempts to amend the motion, I understand that its representatives will discuss with me the substance of that amendment before the debate. Of course, should an amendment be put on the Order Paper, it will require the permission of the Cathaoirleach as no amendment is currently tabled. Clearly, there is a need to decommission the substantial criminal and financial arsenal which Sinn Féin and the IRA have generated as a result of ill-gotten gains and means over the past number of years. There will also be a need to demonstrate over a short period of time that the intimidation and abuse that some republicans hand out to members of their own community has stopped. Let us work to that end and ensure it is at the top of our political priorities as we go forward. Let us deliver the long sought for peace everyone needs.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_21">I record my appreciation that the Leader has acted on her promise on the last day of the last session to hold a debate on child care and early childhood education. I am pleased to see such a debate on today's Order of Business.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I agree with the points Senator Brian Hayes has just made about circumstances in the North of Ireland. The general thinking appears to be that we will have the opportunity for a full debate on the matter next week, which I hope the Leader will confirm. It is crucial to examine the direction we take now and to think differently. I recall that when I was first elected people were not speaking to John Hume because he had opened the discussion and debate with Sinn Féin-IRA which led to many developments including those of this week. We should not forget that fact. Everything must begin somewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">The challenge facing us now is to recognise that the greatest difficulty in the North is old fashioned class politics. Protestant working class estates have been left without any hope, opted out of the establishment and have no trust or confidence in the political system. They see no gain, progress, improvement or future in political activity. We should recognise that what has happened in the case of Sinn Féin has been a development into constitutional democratic politics. The same process must be sold, fed and energised in Protestant working class communities in the North of Ireland. Friends of mine in the trade union movement in the North say that is the greatest challenge and most difficult task facing us. A greater value has been placed on education on the Catholic side, especially over the last three generations, as it was seen as the way to escape the oppression which was suffered certainly until 1970. A similar development is required in Protestant working class communities. We must focus on the task and seek answers. I look forward to a fuller debate on the matter next week on the confirmation of the Leader.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I remind the House that I intend to bring to its notice, as no doubt will my colleague from Kerry, Senator Coghlan, the antipathy in the town of Dingle to the fascistic manner in which its name was changed without consultation. This undemocratic approach is something we must consider in the context of empowering and enabling local people to take control not merely of placenames but of their destinies.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_25">Níor thug mé faoi deara go raibh an oiread sin daoine ag caint faoi anim baile an Daingean. Níor gá an iomarca aird a thabhairt don feactas atá ar siúl.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">While the statement is, of course, welcome and one welcomes and accepts the report of the international decommissioning body, we can only hope for progress. We could also hope for normal politics. I and, I am sure, most Members are sick of the extraordinary way a certain political party can look back at my party's record for the last 25 years and the records of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and tell us what we did wrong, whereas if we dare to mention what they were doing in that period we are promptly told we must look forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">We must engage in realistic politics. All of the things we all did wrong together are infinitely small by comparison with what was done in our names by these people. If they want to look forward, let them draw a curtain behind them. If they want to look back at us, I tell the House that we will look back at them. We have a great deal more to look back at and to be angry about than they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Speaking of being angry, there are five people still in prison who went in before the House adjourned. I do not often wave technical qualifications, but I record that in my limited sphere of knowledge the risk assessment carried out in north Mayo did not represent an example of the way good engineering should be practised in an entirely novel development. This is new. It has never been done anywhere before and should not be done like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">These people will have to be got out of prison. It is a strange society in which five law-abiding people feel obliged to end up in prison for 90 days because of the inability of the State to listen to their needs. Ultimately, the State is responsible because it was the State that allowed this kind of project to go ahead. It is an embarrassment to us all but it should be an embarrassment to the Government in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I would like to have a debate about the issues in this House in the immediate future. Let us not hide behind the fact that it is undoubtedly legal that the men are detained. It could be legal and unjust. The intentions of other people for many years were both legal and unjust. We must debate the matter at length.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">It has come to many people's attention that in spite of the law which states that any aeroplane which lands in this State must provide a manifest of passengers and cargo, some aeroplanes do not do so. That is the law of the land and it is international law as far as air traffic is concerned. I would like the Leader to ascertain if it is true that certain aircraft have been exempted from that requirement. These aircraft are now widely discussed in the media of half a dozen countries, including the United States, but when they land here they are not asked who or what is on board. If that is the case I would like to know why they are exempt from the law of the land and on what basis because it appears we are in grave danger of being directly involved in facilitating the kidnap and torture of, in many cases, innocent human beings. It is time we stood up like other non-aligned and neutral countries, such as Sweden and Austria.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Something was drawn to my attention before the summer, namely, that it is no longer possible for us to know where an item of clothing we purchase was manufactured because EU regulations have changed. Many of us have a great revulsion against the idea that what we wear would have been produced in sweatshops or places where child labour is used or exploited, for instance, in Burma. We cannot know any more. Materials are imported from Burma but we do not know what they are because they are no longer labelled. I ask the Leader to ascertain how and when the rules were changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">As always on the first day of the session there are 200 or 300 items on the Order of Business that will not be adequately discussed by any part of the Oireachtas. I am somewhat disturbed to find three EU draft directives referring to GMOs on the Order Paper. Those directives should not be agreed by Government without a proper debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am equally disturbed to find that the most up-to-date report on the financial affairs of a VEC is for 1999. The idea of a six-year delay in producing a financial report even makes what the Comptroller and Auditor General has to say look less significant.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_34">I know the Cathaoirleach and every other reasonable person will join with me in celebrating and rejoicing over the events that have taken place in the North of Ireland over recent days and in welcoming the report of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. General de Chastelain and his colleagues deserve much credit, as do the clergymen who participated. Their words were authoritative enough for the vast majority of us to accept that the arms are now completely and permanently beyond use and that is a day that many of us thought we might not see.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">It is also worth recalling that on many occasions in this House we had to condemn one atrocity after another on almost a daily basis from each side of the dispute. The Cathaoirleach was a Member of the House at the time and he is aware of this. We now hope there will be a rapid advancement to the primacy of democratic politics within the North of Ireland and that the devolved powers will be restored to Stormont.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">We should also recognise the key role played by previous leaders, both here and in the United Kingdom. The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, deserve particular credit for the patience they have shown over an extended period and for the way in which they have facilitated the process. It would only be right for this House to recognise also the role played by Senator Mansergh in the process.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_38">We hope the atrocities have ended. It is understandable that there would be scepticism in certain quarters although we might not agree with it. We await the report of the monitoring body to ascertain whether criminality and the other forms of atrocity committed by violent people are now discontinued for good. This will obviously be a key element in the advancement of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">When Senator Ryan spoke about clothes, I was reminded of an anecdote concerning former Senator Gordon Wilson. The Cathaoirleach will recall that when the Senator was a Member, he recounted that he spent many hours in his draper's shop in Enniskillen unpicking labels on underclothing which stated "Made in Great Britain" so when people from a certain tradition came into his shop they would not be forced to buy clothing manufactured in Great Britain. I say this by way of light-hearted relief. It serves as a microcosm of the circumstances in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">I was really taken aback yesterday evening when I heard a very good reporter, Tommy Gorman, reporting from the National Ploughing Championships. He said Mr. Adams was mobbed like Mahatma Gandhi. To find any comparator as remote from Mr. Adams as Mahatma Gandhi took some doing because the latter brought an empire to its knees by non-violent methods.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_42">Last weekend I attended a meeting in my own area concerning the Rossport five issue. One would have to be moved by the family members who were present. It is worth bearing in mind that the five men concerned have now been in jail for over 90 days. Yesterday the Joint Committeeon Communications, Marine and Natural Resources had a meeting for over three hours on this issue with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey. Many members were pretty upset that we have reached an impasse such that the five people are still in jail.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">On the basis of the information that has been furnished, many of the developments concerning the offshore gas, including those associated with planning, seem to have proceeded very rapidly, and in the indecent haste defects have arisen. In this context, I hope the Minister will see some chink through which he can approach Shell to find a way to overcome the impasse and ensure the injunction is lifted. I hope he will allow decent dialogue to take place to determine whether we can solve this problem. For many people this issue has become a question of the "multinational versus the small man". It is very regrettable that it has arisen. The people concerned — innocent people from the west — may soon be facing 100 days in jail. It behoves the multinational company, Shell, which this State has accommodated considerably by way of granting it concessions, to try to give something back to remove the impasse that exists.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_44">I would like to be associated with the remarks made by our Leader in welcoming Senator Bohan back to the House after his illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">I want to raise an issue I have raised in the House many times, namely, the need for a debate on cancer care. I am thankful that the debate has moved on a little in that radiotherapy facilities are now to be extended beyond the level initially recommended, including in my area in Waterford. However, a problem still exists in the interim regarding designated transport and accommodation. I want the Tánaiste to come to the House to address this matter. A committee was set up three years ago. Is it still in place? If not, has it put forward its final recommendations? What is its current status? What is the position on the interim recommendations that have been put forward regarding transport and accommodation? Is the funding in place to fund whatever is recommended? This funding must be put in place as a matter of urgency because it will be some time before the roll-out of services to Waterford and other places.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_46">Some 48 hours ago I accepted an invitation to visit Trim Castle at the request of a local councillor who was very concerned at the building of a new hotel there. I was shocked at what I saw. It is an example of our heritage being desecrated for purely commercial reasons. I was impressed that this morning the cathaoirleach of Meath County Council called for an inquiry into the abuse that occurred. I am not well enough informed about the situation but I am aware that a few months ago concern was expressed in this House when the Centre for Public Inquiry was set up. Its report was published yesterday and has provided a public service by focusing on the abuse of the development process which occurred. I believe the Leader of the House will be inundated with requests for a debate on this matter and it should be high on the priority list for debate.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_47">During the summer recess the Taoiseach and the Government have achieved what all Governments since the foundation of the State have been working towards, the declared final, formal cessation of all IRA activity, an exclusive commitment to democracy and the decommissioning of the entire weaponry of that organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">It should be noted that the Taoiseach did not spend all his time pointing out the undoubted moral realities of the situation but concentrated on persuading those whose co-operation was necessary to achieve what we have now arrived at and which is of immense significance for the whole island and not just for Northern Ireland. General de Chastelain, who in one form or another has been involved with his colleagues for ten years, is also to be congratulated on his patience. It is fair to point out that a certain impatience which has been expressed in this House and elsewhere has also contributed to the result that has been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Our democracy is strong and I hope people would now recognise that, with regard to the peace process, the country has been in safe hands and has been led by people with a proper sense of responsibility who knew what they were doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">The Parental Leave Bill, which left this House many months ago, has still not been dealt with by the Dáil. Despite the Government's protestations that it is giving this issue priority, the level of parental leave contained in the Bill is minimal and unpaid. There is a long way to go on this issue and the Opposition will need to keep a close eye on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. We heard much about the rip-off Republic during the summer. Contained within the covers of this report are very startling and serious facts demonstrating how taxpayers are being ripped off wholesale and how public money is being wasted.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">I ask for a debate on the issue of the national treatment purchase fund and the serious anomalies revealed by the Comptroller and Auditor General. There is a worrying report that facts relating to the costs of treatment have not been released by the Department of Health and Children at its own request.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">It is important that full information on the expenditure of taxpayers' money on this fund is revealed as soon as possible. The Minister should also come to the House and be accountable to Senators on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I too wish to refer to the report of the international commission led by General de Chastelain. I generally associate myself with the remarks of Senator Mansergh. We should recognise the efforts made by the people, both those in government and those within the republican movement and what it means to them, who brought this development about. We should also recognise the courage and integrity of the two clergymen witnesses, Fr. Reid and the Reverend Harold Good, both of whom I have known for many years. They are men of monumental integrity and I would take their word on anything. I regret that anybody would doubt it for a moment. In particular, Reverend Harold Good showed enormous courage coming from where he came and standing up and saying up what he said. He deserves all our thanks.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">I hope it is not ungenerous or ungracious in the middle of all this euphoria to make the point that while we welcome the fact that the war is over, we should not allow people to rewrite history and suggest that it was ever a good war in the first place.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">Will the Leader avail of this opportunity to inform Senators of the Government's current thinking on the future of the Great Southern Hotel Group? The chairman of the Dublin Airport Authority has spoken on several occasions, including recently, on this matter. Members of the House would have seen various press reports on the possible doubling of losses in this regard. The chairman of the authority is saying effectively that it must exit this loss-making business and that it is not part of its core activity. What is the Government's position on this? Is there a clear clash between the Government's thinking on this matter and the board's possible decision? Is it the case that the Government is simply waiting for the political climate to be favourable, so to speak, to permit the board to proceed with a decision which it appears to have already taken? I would like to hear the Leader's view on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">I very much agree with what Senator O'Toole said regarding Dingle. I look forward to moving the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill in our joint names. I hope it will have the support of Senators on the Government side. I am sure all Senators on the opposite side of the Chamber would agree that it is a most basic and democratic right for the people of Dingle to decide on this matter for themselves. I do not see how anyone would want to deprive them of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">I would like the Leader to inquire from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to the possibility of introducing a gun amnesty. For some time we have seen reports on the television and in newspapers, on a weekly basis, of people having been killed. There is a distinct possibility that if a gun amnesty were introduced, as happened in other states, guns would be handed in that would never be used. Given that the introduction of such an amnesty has been successful elsewhere, we should examine this possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Transport to come to the House to discuss the possibilities of using ethanol and biodiesel and also to raise this matter with the Minister for Finance. Currently, with the decoupling of payments to the farming community and much land being used in terms of REPs, it just does not seem right that land is being underutilised when we have a wonderful opportunity to replace imports without any objection from the European Community; this is also necessary for our national economy. Such a measure would feed into the economy and more than pay for itself.</p>

Over the past few days we have seen a clear equity imbalance between the 68% that is spent in the east and south east of the country, as against the remainder, which is accounted for by the BMW region. At a time when agriculture is in serious decline and the flight from the land is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, the Government must decide to create a balanced playing field as regards improvements in infrastructure and employment opportunities. There have been dramatic job losses in the western region, from north to south, over the recess period. I ask for an early and urgent debate as regards the BMW region.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">I join with Senator Kenneally in calling for a debate on cancer care. While Senator Kenneally and others who live south of a line from Dublin to Galway can celebrate the imminent roll-out of radiotherapy services, those of us living north of that line do not have the same privilege and cannot look forward to it. I ask the Leader to invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to the House. I ask the House to impress on the Minister the need for radiotherapy services north of the line from Dublin to Galway. Consistently, on so many issues of essential and critical infrastructure, the north west in particular has been overlooked and left until last. Is it possible, for once, to lead from the front and set out a timeframe whereby we will introduce radiotherapy services for the north west?</p>
          <p eId="para_66">On the issue of the Rossport five, I attended the committee meeting alluded to by Senator Finucane. Senator Ryan also mentioned the issue. I am sorry he did not take the time to come to yesterday's meeting to hear of the many things the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is doing. I ask the Cathaoirleach to please bear with me because it is highly regrettable and traumatic for the Rossport five who are in prison and their families. I commend the Minister for everything he is doing within his powers. That is all that he or the Oireachtas can do. He cannot interfere in the legal process. I very much hope the steps he has taken may lead to a successful conclusion whereby these people may purge their contempt.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_79">As from 1 October a new EU regulation will require sheep for export to have a double tag. This affects, in particular, farmers along the Border and Donegal farmers in particular who, on an annual basis, export approximately 70,000 sheep to Foyle Meats in Derry. The current position is that the Department does not issue tags and sheep farmers do not have a second tag for their animals. The requirement to tag sheep was unnecessary given that a herd number would be sufficient to ensure traceability but the requirement to tag twice is ludicrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">As a result of this policy, sheep farmers in County Donegal will be required to send sheep south which plays into the hands of the meat factories. The issue of dictatorships was raised. Meat factories have been acting like dictators in determining prices and driving farmers off the land. If farmers in County Donegal are forced to send in excess of 70,000 sheep to meat factories in the south, prices will be driven down further, more farmers will be driven off the land and the farming industry will be driven further into the ground. I am aware the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, is ploughing a lonely furrow in Cork these days. I ask the Leader to intervene to ensure she abandons the requirement to have a second tag as it will drive more farmers in County Donegal off the land. Foyle Meats is located just ten minutes from the Border. This ridiculous bureaucratic nonsense must stop.</p>

A recycling system initially received support from the Government and the plastics industry but the group involved in the collection of levies appears to have run out of money. Farmers paid for plastics at the time bales were made and now have piles of plastic in their yards. They are concerned they may not comply with the REPS regulations and the detrimental impact this would have. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to come before the House to outline concrete proposals to alleviate the current problem? It would be wholly unfair to expect farmers to pay again for the destruction or recycling of plastics when they have already made a financial commitment to this end.</p>

Many practical decisions made in pursuit of peace were, however, unfair. I refer specifically to treatment of the SDLP, the true democratic party in Northern Ireland, which has been sidelined by the British and Irish Governments for too long. The Fine Gael Party met a delegation from the SDLP last Wednesday. The simple reason the party was sidelined was that it did not have guns. I appeal to the Government to ensure the SDLP is treated fairly once again. Now that the gun has been removed from Irish politics, it is time for the true democratic parties to reassert their claim.</p>

          <from>Mr. Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_83">I concur with Senator McHugh's comments on bureaucratic madness. It is particularly evident in County Donegal where sheep being exported to the North must be transported 25 or 30 miles south to be inspected and retagged before being driven a further 25 or 30 miles back across the Border, although the destination meat factory is located just ten minutes away. As a result of this practice, sheep are sometimes not slaughtered on the day following inspection.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Senators will be aware of the problems encountered with regard to school buses during the summer. The two issues which arise in this context are the three for two policy and continuing problems associated with private bus operators used by Bus Éireann. I understand one of the main grievances of the private operators is that Bus Éireann refuses to negotiate with them as a group, despite the fact that they have a representative body. I ask the Minister to instruct Bus Éireann to negotiate with this body. This is a democratic country and these people should be represented by their own groups. Every other organisation in the country is represented by its umbrella body and these people deserve the same treatment. We must deal with this issue soon because it will arise again.</p>

It was grossly unfair on the VECs, Bus Éireann and the parents and children to have such pressure put on them in July and August. The decision will be implemented for primary school children next year and will be done over a year and a half. The decision to do it was not wrong, the timing was wrong. Lessons must be learned from this and I urge the Leader to speak to the Minister for Education and Science and suggest to her that she write to the VECs and Bus Éireann and thank them for the great work they did in difficult circumstances during the summer. Hopefully we will get an assurance that lessons have been learned from this fiasco when the same policy is being implemented for primary schools.</p>

Senator O'Toole also praised John Hume and said that old fashioned class politics were now developing in the North, something that will take time to root out. A weariness has crept in, North and South, about the debate. We all say it is wonderful but it has been going on for so long. Senator O'Toole also raised the issue of An Daingean-Dingle. He could move No. 18 on the Order Paper, his own Bill, and we could work out a time to debate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">Senator Ryan welcomed the report of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. He mentioned Shell and the Rossport five. He also asked me to find out if all flights must have a manifesto detailing the people and material on board and if any flights are exempt from such provisions. I will find out. He further asked about the closure of sweatshops, now that the EU does not require a declaration on the origin of clothing. None of us would like to be associated with the purchase of clothes from sweatshops but we do not know about it. The Senator also claimed some EU directives are not being debated in the Oireachtas and that there has not been a report on the finances of the VECs since 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">Senator Dardis welcomed events in Northern Ireland and paid particular tribute to the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister but he rightly poured very cold water on the comparison made by RTE's Northern editor between Gerry Adams and Mahatma Ghandi. One worked by peaceful means and the other did not.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Senator Finucane asked about the meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the matter involving Shell.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">Senator Mansergh raised the matter of the Northern Ireland peace process. The Taoiseach concentrated on persuasion which I believe is his forte. I join with others who have paid tribute to Senator Mansergh. From what Fr. Alec Reid, the Reverend Good, Albert Reynolds and others have said, it is clear he was at the very heart of the process. It was great to see this expressed. Great lustre shines on the House that such eminence is in our midst. I thank Senator Mansergh. While I know he will blush and give out to me about this, I wanted to congratulate him.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">Senator O'Meara raised the issues of early childhood education and the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill. However, the Bill is only in the Dáil now. In the last parliamentary term, one of her colleagues suggested we should franchise out our facilitators for getting Bills through the Dáil. Next week, Senator White will introduce a Private Members' Bill on flexi-time for working parents which will add to the debate. The Government and potential Governments must approach this complex issue carefully. It is not about throwing tax reliefs at this, that and the other. Children are complex human beings and parenting is a complex operation, as Members are aware. Not enough emphasis has been placed on the father and mother who elect to stay at home as childminders. There is no doubt that a constitutional issue is involved and woe betide any Government that would seek to ameliorate one side of the equation and not the other. This will be a complex debate and we will have to be very careful in approaching this issue. Senator O'Meara also wants a debate on the national treatment purchase fund which would be useful.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_56">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_123">I welcome everyone to the debate today. I am speaking on this topic on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin. I would like to start by emphasising the importance which the Government attaches to this subject. It is of fundamental importance to the future weIl-being of all our people. The early childhood period is widely recognised as a key source of health, well-being, socialisation and, crucially, the foundation for the lifelong learning that underpins all other aspects of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">I will address specifically the education dimension of the early childhood period, but it is important to understand that while there is a difference in theory between early childhood education and early childhood care, the two are very closely linked. For this reason the early childhood period is a classic policy issue involving inputs from a number of Departments and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The Department of Education and Science is strongly committed to the development of early childhood education. The enhancement of early childhood services in accordance with the White Paper on early childhood education, Ready to Learn, is being undertaken on a collaborative phased basis and will draw together and build upon the many examples of best practice in early education that have emerged in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The White Paper sets out a strategy in respect of children from birth to six years of age. The key objective is to support the development and educational achievement of children through high-quality early education, with a particular focus on the disadvantaged and those with special needs. The guiding principles which underpin the White Paper strategy are as follows: that quality must permeate all aspects of early education provision; that the State will seek to build on existing provision and use the existing regulatory framework where possible; that implementation will be undertaken on a gradual phased basis to allow all the participants in the system to prepare adequately for the challenges which lie ahead; and that progress will be achieved through a process of consultation, dialogue and partnership with parents, providers and interested parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">In order to combat disadvantage and promote education, special emphasis is being placed on the provision of appropriate pre-school education in areas of social deprivation and those with special needs. The Early Start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk in the mid 1990s. The aims of Early Start are to expose young children to an educational programme which will enhance their overall development, prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">The approach taken in Early Start is to establish groups of 15 pupils in existing primary schools in disadvantaged areas, with each class being run by a primary school teacher and a qualified child care worker. While the Early Start curriculum emphasises the development of cognitive and language skills, due regard is also paid to personal and social development.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Some 56 teachers and 56 child care workers are employed in 16 full Early Start units serving 60 children each, split along the lines of 30 in the morning and 30 in the afternoon, and 24 half units in the mornings only. The total number of places at present is 1,680 and total expenditure is in the order of €4 million annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">In addition, a new action plan called Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools was launched by the Minister for Education and Science last May. This action plan aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school to completion of upper second level education, are prioritised and addressed effectively. This action plan will be implemented on a phased basis over the next five years and will involve an additional annual investment of some €40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Targeted early childhood education provision will be a key element of this new action plan. The objective is to concentrate early education actions on those children, aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities. On a phased basis, the 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage will be provided with access to early education for children aged from three up to school enrolment.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">The approach of the Department of Education and Science will be to work in partnership with other Departments and agencies to complement and add value to existing child care programmes in disadvantaged communities with a view to ensuring that the overall care and education needs of the children concerned are met in an integrated way.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">A total of 46 pre-schools catering for approximately 500 Traveller children are supported by the Department of Education and Science. The Department funds 98% of the tuition and transport costs involved in this service. It also allocates an annual equipment grant to each pre-school and pays an additional grant of €50 per child over three years old and less than five years old. In some cases, the pre-schools also receive support from health boards, often to defray some of the costs associated with child care assistants.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The Department is developing a Traveller education strategy. The main objective of this strategy is to ensure equality of outcomes for Travellers from education. It will map out the way forward for Traveller education, taking account of the complexity of the issues involved, the history of provision and existing measures. It will mark out the challenges for the future and identify ways to approach those challenges. Pre-school provision for Travellers is being examined as part of this process. The development of pre-school services generally, outside of the specific area of disadvantage, is also a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">In 2002, the Department established the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education as part of the Government's commitment to early education for all children. The remit of this centre includes the development, co-ordination and enhancement of early childhood education in Ireland. The centre has a valuable role to play in laying the foundations necessary to support developments in the early childhood area. The centre is currently developing a conceptual framework for early childhood learning that will be comprehensive in nature and will cover such issues as the following: national standards for quality in early childhood care and education, covering all aspects of provision, including environment, programmes, activities and staffing; provision for a range of supports for early childhood care and education practitioners and services; and the assessment of quality. The draft framework wiII be available within the next few months. The centre operates under the aegis of my Department and in conjunction with St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and the Dublin Institute of Technology. The initial operating period of the centre was three years and it is a measure of the Government's commitment to the work of the centre and to the early childhood area generally that the Department has recently sanctioned the continued operation of the centre for a further period of three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">In order to obtain an international expert assessment of the situation in Ireland, in 2002 the Department invited the OECD to conduct a review of early childhood policies here. The OECD's dedication over many years to high-quality research leading to collective discussion and analysis of policy has earned it an extraordinarily high level of public trust and respect. The focus of the OECD review team was as follows: to place the issues around early childhood provision firmly within the Irish context; review the early care and educational policies and practices as they meet the needs of Irish children and their families; consider ongoing developments with a critical eye for sustainability; make recommendations that would make success more likely; and indicate areas for future effort and emphasis.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">The review team met with many Departments, agencies and other stakeholders dealing with early childhood issues and made site visits covering a range of services for young children from four months to six years of age. It brought a wealth of international expertise to bear on the issues involved, as we knew it would, and it produced a host of very valuable recommendations across the three focus areas of access, quality and co-ordination. As the report of the OECD review team makes clear, these recommendations were offered not as hard and fast conclusions, but in the spirit of professional dialogue for the consideration of policymakers and specialists. The Department is examining the policy implications of the OECD's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">In March last year the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment produced a consultative document called Towards a Framework for Early Learning which dealt with the development of a national framework to support children's learning. Such a framework will be useful to those who are responsible for children's early learning and development. This includes parents, guardians, childminders and practitioners working in a range of settings outside the home. This framework, focusing as it does on curricular matters, will complement the development of the quality framework being developed by the centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">In addition, the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, has just completed a report focusing on the development of a long-term vision for the provision of integrated early years services in an Irish context. This report had three clear aims as follows: to identify what progress had been made with regard to implementing the recommendations of recent reports and policy documents; to develop a coherent policy framework for early childhood care and education; and to set out an implementation process with key targets and objectives to be achieved at policy level over the next five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">The overall approach of the forum is evidence based and brings together the complex strands of policy and service interaction involved in developing early childhood education and care in a comprehensive way. The report sets out a policy framework and recommendations based on five principles which reflect those set out in the national children's strategy. The report clearly acknowledges the value of investment in this area which has beneficial outcomes for children and families as well as for the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The NESF proposals envisage a timeframe of up to 2015 for implementation. While the NESF also favours a degree of universality in its recommendations, there is also an acknowledgement of the need for prioritisation and for targeting those families and children with particular needs. This is a measured approach which balances the need to make improvements with the need to take a staged approach to build up the necessary infrastructure and workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">As I stated at the outset, the link between the education and care aspects of early childhood provision is very strong. Consequently, it is important that I should briefly address the care element. The bulk of pre-school places in the country are financed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has provided unprecedented levels of funding for child care in recent years. The Department of Health and Children also provides grants to child care groups, including community groups in areas of social and economic disadvantage. Child benefit has more than tripled from €38.10 in 1997 to €141.60 today. Since 1997, the Government has increased the annual provision of child care services by more than €198 million in real terms and has invested in excess of €60 million in capital projects for services for children who are at risk and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">In the specific context of child care — in the sense of the care and minding of children not at risk — the equal opportunities child care programme running from 2000 to 2006 has a total budget of €499 million. This programme is administered by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and received an increased allocation of current funding in the context of the mid-term review of the national development plan. It subsequently received an increased capital commitment totalling €90 million over five years, of which the first €50 million will be available for the present phase of the programme. This was done in the 2005 budget to help meet the need for centre-based community non-profit-making child care services to support parents in employment, education and training. The original intention was to increase the supply of child care places by 50% or 28,300 new places. However, commitments to date will lead, when complete, to the creation of more than 39,000 new places. Of these, some 24,600 were already in place at the end of December 2004. The programme also aims to enhance quality awareness in the child care sector and to promote better co-ordination in the planning and delivery of child care at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The programme operates under three sub-measures to meet its aims and provides grant assistance in the form of capital funding for both community non-profit-making groups and for private providers; staffing supports for community non-profit-making groups in disadvantaged areas; and supports for quality improvement projects, including supports to the 33 city and county child care committees and the national voluntary child care organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">The total funding committed over the period from 2000 to date is more than €447 million, of which almost €392 million has been allocated to child care facilities. This includes €45.6 million in capital and staffing grants announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 22 June 2005. Over €55 million has been allocated to quality improvement measures to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">A significant part of the remaining funding will be required for the following: the roll-over staffing grant supports being made available to child care facilities which cater for disadvantaged families; ongoing supports to the city and county child care committees; the national voluntary child care organisations; the national childminding initiative; the Partnerships for Quality Childcare collaborative initiative; the provision of capital grant assistance for the development of child care facilities in areas where there are gaps in service provision; and for the development of school age child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The achievements of the programme to date include the awarding of more than 3,300 grants to a mixture of community group and private provider child care facilities. On occasion, projects may be in receipt of several grants. In addition, the original target under the national development plan for new child care places has been adjusted upwards to 31,300 new child care places following positive assessments under the mid-term evaluation of the development plan. Moreover, some 39,000 new child care places will be created with funding committed to date. Of these, 26,000 new places were in place at the end of June 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">While this means that the expected number of child care places created will exceed the target set for the programme, the requirement for further child care places has been identified. Consequently, the creation of further quality child care places remains an important goal of the equal opportunities programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">While there already are school age child care facilities in place in Ireland, including a number which have received funding under the programme, it is hoped that the new initiative to promote school age child care will give greater impetus to the future development of this part of the child care sector. On 22 June 2005 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced the publication of a report dealing with school age child care in Ireland. The report makes a number of recommendations for the development of this sector to support the child care needs of parents, including the use of school premises where appropriate as a location to develop a quality school age child care service. The report also contains recommendations which place a strong emphasis on delivering quality in developing this aspect of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The 33 city and county child care committees will have a major role in bringing forward this new initiative. A seminar was hosted by the Department for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on Monday, 26 September to further this role. Funding is being available to the committees to enable them to publicise the report locally and to identify school management authorities who might be interested in developing a service to complement and link with their schools. In addition, a national and local advertising campaign is about to be launched to publicise the initiative, as this approach to school age child care will involve the participation of parents, school management authorities, relevant statutory bodies, community based non-profit-making child care services and private child care providers. Other issues under consideration at present include the following: the introduction of appropriate fee structures for community based services to ensure their sustainability; the introduction of new arrangements for the support of community based services in areas of significant disadvantage where the parents cannot afford to contribute to the economic cost of providing a service; and the development of ideas on the next phase of the programme for the next national development plan.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_58" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_152">These developments represent just some of the many initiatives currently being undertaken in the area of child care. Much has happened in respect of both the education and care aspects of early childhood provision and no doubt much more will happen in future. All this activity must be linked together to maximise its impact on the provision of the best possible service to young children and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">For this reason, the Government through the Cabinet committee on child care and education asked the National Children's Office to chair a high level working group to develop an integrated response to the issue of child care and education. The children's office is a cross-cutting office set up to support me in the implementation of the national children's strategy and was considered by the Government to be best placed to chair this group. The group will have due regard to the importance of a child-centred approach including the whole child perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The unique aspect of this review is that it incorporates all the Departments with a role in this area within the group. Through the involvement of the National Children's Office, it safeguards the child-centred approach required and is specifically focused on dealing with the problem of integration of policy development and implementation. Progress reports were submitted in April and July 2005 to the Cabinet committee on children.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">This working group will provide the Government with a range of options which will make the link between education and care and the benefits to be gained by individual children as well as by communities and society in general; increase the supply of appropriate early childhood education and care settings by developing capacity in the system; include measures which make services more affordable; and ensure quality is a design feature in the child care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">As part of the work of the high level group, the children's office has commissioned an independent economic and cost benefit analysis of current policies and future policy options for increasing the supply and affordability of child care. This report has been received by the children's office and is currently under consideration by the group. The high level group is expected to report back to the Cabinet shortly with an integrated set of policy options. As part of its work, the group will also be considering a number of significant reports that have been published recently which make a valuable contribution to the child care debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The NESF report on early childhood care and education which was published earlier this week will be considered in full by the group. In this report the forum recommends a policy framework and implementation plan to cover a ten year period. However, many of the underlying principles for their proposed policy reflect those adopted by the high level working group and as such, the group will consider the NESF's recommendations as part of their examination of the options. Similarly, the National Women's Council recently launched their accessible child care model report which will also be considered by the high level group.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">In devising policy, it is often easy to see what worked well in the past. It is even easy to see what is working well at present. However, it is much more difficult to create something that will properly address future needs. To do so in a sustained way calls for hard-headed realism in assessing challenges that are still emerging and the creativity to imagine the structures that will best meet them.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">Everyone here today and everyone else active in the area of early childhood care and education wants to put in place the best possible service for our children and for the hard pressed parents who strive on a daily basis to juggle the commitments of work and home. Commitment is not the issue, rather it is devising the structures to deliver the best service. The very best of intentions will not deliver a service to even one child. Translating our vision and the vision of all those who have contributed to the reviews and reports outlined here today into practical, cost effective structures and processes will deliver the service children need.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The Government recognises the importance of this issue but also the complexity of getting the right mix of initiatives. It is my belief that any future framework must incorporate an integrated approach across Government. It must offer choices to families by increasing supply, diversity and affordability and it must be based on quality services as this is central to achieving the right outcomes for individual children, their families and wider society. All the parties involved in the early childhood education and care sectors have a role to play in building the right structures and processes for delivering a quality service second to none.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_59">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_161">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. In the absence of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, it is appropriate that the Minister of State with responsibility for children is here. Much of his speech dealt with child care. It is very opportune that we are debating the report on early childhood education at this stage. The report is welcome and is very balanced and I congratulate the Chairman and members of the committee who produced it.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">However, there is an element of frustration in the report as it identifies clearly the fact that we have had report after report over the years, along with committee reviews and analyses. In 1998, the National Forum for Early Childhood Education delivered a report, as did the Commission on the Family, which was created by the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, while there was also a report by the Partnership 2000 expert group on child care. All of those reports highlighted proposals and recommendations in child care, but we have had no action whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">In 1994-95, the early start programme was initiated. In 1996, over 1,600 places were created and there has been no expansion since outside the obviously disadvantaged sections of society in Waterford, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Dundalk and a few other places. The Minister of State stated in his speech that the Department of Education and Science is strongly committed to the development of early childhood education. That rings hollow in the minds of so many people because the reality is very different. If there was a commitment, why has there been no commitment to expansion, albeit in targeted regions to those who need it? Those who benefit from the €4 million to €5 million contribution welcome it very much.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Throughout the report, there is a criticism that at a time of plenty in this country, the Government has done nothing. It has frozen action on this aspect of early childhood education and care. Other countries are economically worse off than Ireland, yet they still have far greater commitments to providing child care. Our contribution represents 0.2% of our GDP, whereas most other European countries commit an average of 5% of GDP to child care, while Denmark and France contribute 8% and 7% of GDP. In these countries, 90% of the young population have access to and participate in early preschool education and care.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Why do we have such a poor response? There has been no commitment by successive Ministers of Education and Science in the past two Governments to accelerate a programme from which many young people could benefit. It is often highlighted in the report that people in disadvantaged areas have been targeted, such as members of the Traveller community and people with special needs. This is welcome, but we want a universal scheme where every child between the ages of two and five will have access to and participate in early childhood education and care. That is the difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">This report is nothing more than a clear indication of Government inactivity. I fear that we have a parallel to that which occurred before the summer recess, when we debated the Bill on special needs and the role played by the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children. One of the strong recommendations of this report is that a single Department takes responsibility for early education and child care. There is no indication in the speech given by the Minister of State that such a change will come about. The Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, as well as the Department of Education and Science are all trying to contribute to policy making. There is no co-ordination and no focus on the reality of what is happening on the ground. As there is so much duplication, funds have been wasted which could be used far more appropriately in the delivery of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">The Minister of State claimed that commitment was not the issue. I differ strongly with him as I believe it is the issue. If a commitment existed, there would be a delivery of a far greater service than that which currently exists. The service is the same today as it was in 1994-95 when the early start programme was initiated and when €4 million to €5 million was spent in 1996. In the US, the UK and northern Europe, a number of cost benefit analyses indicate clearly that the cost of €1 would have a return benefit of €7. If that is the case, I do not know how any Government or Minister can dilly dally any longer. In the heat of the upcoming election, the Minister for Finance recently said in Cavan that early childhood education and care is the important issue to which the Government must respond. However, he said that he would not introduce it in a universal way but in an incremental way, in a period of five to ten years. Nothing has happened in the last ten years so what can we expect in the next ten? The exception is that in this instance we have a report in which a very important cross-section of society has clearly identified what is essential for us to respond to. Many people have the idea that the debate in the current climate is taking place in response to the fact that so many parents, especially women, are at work. While that is a factor, I hope the debate is broadened to a discussion of a response which takes account of the tremendous returns from any input which is made at this early stage. Research has shown that young people aged between two and five years experience the most accelerated period of development of their lifetimes. If we allow those formative years to pass, we will pay the price later as evidenced in societies internationally as well as here where we have experienced a share of crime, drugs, poor health and anti-social behaviour problems which we could well do without. While we must appreciate fully that parents are the primary educators and, as such, have responsibilities, we must acknowledge that many parents are forced into circumstances in which they must go out to work to make ends meet. In the absence of continuing parental education in the home, we must ensure that services provided are of the highest quality and that everyone involved is provided with the appropriate training and facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">There is a clear indication that children who transfer to primary school having had access to some element of pre-school education have an advantage over those who do not do so. We were told by the current Minister that one of her priorities in office would be the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio. Action in this area would have meant a significant advantage for children under nine years of age at primary level, but nothing has happened. While we have been told that 600 additional jobs have been created, they have had no impact on the overall reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio. If we lack commitment to the services which already exist, how can we expect additional funding to be provided? While it might be listed — and the Minister of State has quantified the additional funds which will be put in place — Deputy Cowen's remarks make it very doubtful that any increments will be other than very small.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">In response to the report, I ask the Minister of State, through Deputy Hanafin, to request at Cabinet that a single Department and Minister take responsibility for the diffuse area of child care and early childhood education. This action is necessary to provide focus and to ensure appropriate levels of funding are provided. I hope the Department of Education and Science will indicate that any new national school will encompass facilities on a single campus to ensure the provision of early childhood education is part of the primary system. While I do not know which Minister the Government would decide should take overall responsibility in the area, what is most important is for the Government to establish the scheme on a universal basis at a time when the funds to do so are available. While the targets for disadvantaged areas and others were welcome, access must be universal for all children.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">We must pay tribute to the more than 50 groups which made submissions on the report with a view to improving and enhancing services in this area. We have a growing population and workforce and are told we need more workers. Given the extent of the return indicated in the cost-benefit analysis outlined in the report, I cannot understand why we are delaying implementation any longer.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fitzgerald</from>
          <p eId="para_171">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for outlining developments, improvements and the establishment of structures at departmental and sub-departmental level over the past seven or eight years to address the crucial issue of the welfare and education of children. While I found I came close to agreeing with Senator Ulick Burke on some of the last sentiments he expressed, I disagree fully and fundamentally with him on certain earlier points.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Child care and early childhood education have been accepted internationally as well as in Ireland as crucial issues. Early childhood education strengthens the foundations of lifelong learning for all children. While we have been hearing about child care and early childhood education for a number of decades, there is a definite and growing consensus on these subjects. Early learning is the foundation for all subsequent learning, including lifelong learning, and early childhood offers a tremendous opportunity to enrich and extend children's learning over time. All ongoing neuroscientific research demonstrates that a child's ability to learn rapidly develops at a young age and indicates that children are innately motivated to learn and need not be forced to do so. While learning happens spontaneously, we must provide children with opportunities to engage in the process. We must create the healthiest possible environments for learning, crucial to which is the recognition that children have needs both for education and care. The Minister of State and Senator Ulick Burke referred to these needs in great detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">Government policy in this area came to the fore on foot of the wide-ranging public consultation process on the needs of young children initiated by the previous Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in 1997-98. From the examination of the pre-school and early school needs of children came the White Paper on early childhood education, Ready to Learn, which was referred to frequently by the Minister of State and Senator Ulick Burke. The White Paper emphasised that the focus can never be exclusively on either education or care, but must be on both. Care is so crucial to the life of a child and the environment in which it is provided is so special that Government must work on the two issues together. To attempt to work on the issues separately would be to miss out on the real gains which are there to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">I wish to deal at this early stage in my contribution with an issue raised by Senator Ulick Burke. While the Senator finds it very hard to accept, there has been real progress over the past seven or eight years through investment, support, the provision of increased numbers of places for child care, assistance through the equal opportunities childcare programme to which the Minister of State has referred to in detail, FÁS and the health boards. While the number of places has been expanded and facilities and quality upgraded, there is a significant lacuna which remains to be addressed. To do that, we must move towards the integration of education and care. Three issues are vitally important to deal with an effective programme into the future, namely, the quality of early childhood education and care, access to the service — to which Senator Ulick Burke referred — and proper co-ordination. Substantial additional investment will be required to target these three objectives within the overall programme. The good news, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and Senator Ulick Burke have already adverted, is that it makes a lot of sense from an economic point of view to promote a national programme of pre-school education and care. The return is in the order of 7:1. That was the experience in the United States and that same experience is being vindicated by the National Economic and Social Forum report that was published this week. The good news is that it makes economic sense to go down this road and the most recent report published here by politicians and officials reinforces and vindicates that view.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">One of the causes of the lacuna in pre-school services is that 50% of four year old children are enrolled in junior primary school and nearly all of five year olds are enrolled. Due to the fact that children here go to school at such a young age the pre-school service has not been given the same emphasis as would have been the case in Finland and other countries in Europe where the school-going age is much older. As a result of the fact that the school-going age is much older elsewhere, other countries have to varying degrees a more comprehensive national pre-school service. Our service was by and large dependent on voluntary effort. It is reminiscent of the way our adult education service developed in the 1970s and 1980s — on a wing and a prayer. The service was patchy, uneven and there was no comprehensive national programme in place. However, in the past seven or eight years there has been a definite commitment under the equal opportunities childcare programme to develop a policy of pre-school child care facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Senator Ulick Burke referred to the inadequacy of what has been done over the past seven or eight years. It is true that this has been inadequate to meet present and future needs. We would be the first to admit that, but we must take into account how radically society has changed in recent years. In the past nine or ten years we have the highest population since the 1870s. Children under six years of age make up 10% of the population. Lone parent families make up 12% of households in the country. We are rapidly becoming an urbanised society. Most of these things have happened as a consequence of the phenomenal economic growth that has taken place. With all of these changes the demand has increased greatly over that period. Listening to Senator Ulick Burke, one would think that from 1994 to 1997 the Fine Gael Party had no contact with Government or no opportunity to do anything about the needs that were already in evidence and growing.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fitzgerald</from>
          <p eId="para_182">There was a failure to acknowledge that the need existed and was growing. The demand became spectacular with the turn of the new century.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">There have been a number of Government initiatives in this area over the past seven or eight years to target the phenomenal growth and to acknowledge that the problem exists and is growing. First, there was the establishment of a Cabinet committee on children. This was a significant move to try to integrate and co-ordinate the range of services that existed. While there might have been an historical reason the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform had responsibility for policy relating to children, I have never been able to accept it. I do not accept it today and I will not accept it tomorrow. Nevertheless it exists but I hope it will not be there for much longer. To that extent I empathise with Senator Ulick Burke.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The Cabinet committee on children was one structure established by the Government in an attempt to pull all the strands together and to give some kind of unity of purpose to policy and the implementation of policy in the care and education of children. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is an example of how joined-up Government is attempting to work by virtue of his having responsibility across a number of Departments. It is a nonsense that responsibility for children is spread over five Departments. I am prepared to accept that without equivocation. It should not continue for much longer and I hope it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The national children's strategy was another significant development. The Department of Education and Science published a White Paper, Ready to Learn, following extensive public consultation. Following from the White Paper, the Centre for Early Childhood Development in Education was established. Its aim was to develop and co-ordinate early childhood care and education in line with the objectives of the White Paper. The OECD produced a report last year following a wide ranging examination of early childhood care and education. It identified significant shortcomings to meet present and future demands in this area. Many of its recommendations have been endorsed and reinforced by the report of the forum that was published this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">A number of significant developments have been and are taking place across Departments. I hope they are all moving towards the centre and that ultimate objective to which Senator Ulick Burke referred with which I agree. For example, in a new departure for it, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has published a document that seeks to work in close partnership with the early childhood sector. It was not established for that purpose but it has now acknowledged that new role and is embracing it enthusiastically. That document was the first publication of its kind to extend beyond the boundaries of pure education, which is a significant development. I admit that progress has been slow. It is not before its time and has a lot further to go but, nevertheless, it is to be welcomed. As I stated, the national children's strategy is a vital component in the overall approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">I welcome the National Economic and Social Forum report. Many of its recommendations are far reaching, challenging and tell us some home truths. We are on the right road. We are moving towards a unified approach to this problem in terms of Departments. I call on the Government to designate a single Minister at the Cabinet table with full responsibility for this area. It would be most appropriate that the responsibility would rest with the Minister for Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">I agree with the conclusion of the forum's report. We have a unique opportunity over the next ten years to establish a landmark in social and educational history. Many elements are already in place. This debate is concerned with young children from birth to six years of age. It is about how to provide the best care for them in the Ireland of today and into the future. It is about creating the best environment for them in which to learn and about enabling all our children to have the best quality of life possible and to participate as fully as possible in society. If we can move closer to realising those objectives, our children and society in general will stand to reap great dividends along the way.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_67">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_189">I, too, welcome the Minister of State to the House. I remind him that since the redrawing of the boundaries, I am now his constituent and expect to be listened to. I promise him that, as a graduate, I will look after his needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">There is a considerable amount of material associated with this subject. I sense that the Minister of State has been sent in to bat with a fine speech that says everything but is going nowhere. It is full of possibilities but contains no certainties. He said the NESF report has three clear aims, one of which is to set out an implementation process with key targets and objectives to be achieved at policy level over the next five years. Towards the end of his speech he said the Government will set up a high-level group to work out the options and potential for the next couple of years. One would want to be devoid of a sense of irony not to realise this is just going around in a circle.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Let me draw the attention of the Minister of State to the fact that the NESF report points out very clearly that we have ample policy concerning early childhood care and education but now need structures to ensure its implementation. That is what I want to consider today. I have spoken to many different groups involved in this area and have had some involvement in it in one way or another for many years. To address the issue, we should, as a first step, have one Department, headed by one Minister, responsible for the whole area of child care and education. Which Department it should be represents another day's discussion. There is an absolute need to increase paid maternity leave to 26 weeks, and we should begin that process immediately. I have said that paid parental leave should be increased to 26 weeks so many times in the House that it does not need to be reiterated. This is absolutely necessary and is in line with what is happening throughout Europe. We also need funded or free universal access to child care for three year olds.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">One of the first tasks I would like prioritised and achieved is the establishment of an accreditation system for all the providers in child care and early childhood education. The advantage of this is that it would allow for variety. As general secretary of the INTO, I argued very strongly that there should be a variety of possibilities for children in the formative years from birth to five years. These would include school, play, nursery care and child care, yet there would be an insistence on quality, which would be determined by accreditation. In this regard, an accreditation body is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">There are many people working on this issue. There is no way the high-level working group the Minister of State is about to set up will second guess the levels of commitment and reporting that have been evident over the past ten years. It cannot and will not do so. It would be better for it to consider what every group is saying. I know I am summarising what the Minister of State said and am in a sense putting words in his mouth.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">Yes, but I do not believe Senator Ulick Burke is at all worried that will happen. That is the truth of the matter and we must bear it in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">I have been considering the work of the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, which has been mentioned. I have been considering what the Irish Childcare Policy Network has done and have examined the OECD report and the statements of the National Women's Council of Ireland. I have also looked at the NESF report and have tried to anticipate the content of the national equality framework for early childhood care and education, which will be presented shortly to the Department of Education and Science by the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education. Are there consistent lines and issues on which one can draw? Is there a consensus between these diverse groups? The truth is that there are many consistent demands and conclusions replicated among the statements of these bodies. We should consider them.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The Irish Childcare Policy Network has asked that provision be made for 26 weeks maternity leave, paid parental leave and free preschool for all. I am just summarising some of its demands; it has obviously made more. I want to hang this debate on actualities and real tasks that can and must be carried out immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Consider the OECD report, which states we have a very solid support structure for four to six year olds within the national school system. I am glad some of us took a strong stand on this matter 25 years ago. The support structure is now standing us in good stead. It is important that Irish people understand that, in much of the rest of Europe, this age group would be considered to be in the preschool category. The OECD report also recognised that there was a very solid active and voluntary and community sector in the area of early childhood education and care and that there were strong local partnerships upon which we could build. This is linked to what I said about variety. The existing framework provides a structure on which to build. The report calls for publicly funded support structures for three to six year olds. The Minister of State signed up to this, as did we all. The support structures would involve school and after-school activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Consider the relief that would be created by putting in place the publicly funded support structures. The high-level group should take the first step through the current budget. The National Women's Council of Ireland has sought a very similar provision, namely, universal access and support structures for children between three and six. It has also suggested that there should be a certain level of support for infants from birth to 12 months and an advanced or different level of support for children from one to three years. It has suggested there should be a more regularised structure for those between three and six years. We must consider these issues. Structures should be formal while the activities and learning should be informal. However, in all cases the system should be structured. There should be a framework. One cannot just let it happen by itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">I am one of the few people in this country who believes it is utterly daft that parents are regarded, under our Constitution, as the prime educators. It is grossly unfair on them that they are lumped with this responsibility. They should have a responsibility to see that their children are educated. It is difficult to understand why the writers of the Constitution said parents should educate their children. Their responsibility should be to ensure that their children become educated and to use whatever structures are put in place by the State to do so. We should be developing such structures for the younger children in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The National Women's Council of Ireland stressed time and again the importance of extending maternity leave and the importance of parental leave. A related issue, dealt with very specifically in a European directive some years ago, concerns the attitude of businesses to women who are pregnant, who have recently had children or who are breastfeeding. I have received many calls from women working in the lower to mid-range of middle management who, on return from maternity leave, are being in some way disregarded and treated with some contempt or are not being afforded equality of esteem because they have taken time out to have children.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">In order to ensure the continuance of the tribe, we need to be supportive of child care. It is worthwhile reminding ourselves of the extraordinary announcement last week by the French Government announcing it was making sizeable grants available to "professional" people to encourage them to have a third child. I do not know how this will be achieved but I suggest a high-level group may be needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">If all children and parents are not supported then this country will encounter the same problem of an unsatisfactory level of births as exists in France. Following a drop to below two, the Irish fertility rate has risen again but it must be raised to over 2.1. The Scandinavian countries——</p>

          <p eId="para_211">I have five points which I ask the Minister of State to consider. I suggest one Minister of State in one Department should deal with the area of child care and child education.

I suggest universal access for all three year olds to care and education, whichever is appropriate. I suggest an accreditation system for all providers of child care. These suggestions could be written by the Minister of State on the back of an envelope and there is no need for a long speech. These are five easy points.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House. The importance of education in early childhood is recognised by all. By means of my party's manifesto and An Agreed Programme for Government, the Government has sought to bring together the complex areas of childhood education, child poverty and child care, to ensure that all that can be done is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Our objectives are clear, including valuing children to the utmost, providing holistic support, reducing poverty and increasing access. We will ensure the policy and resources are in place to provide the necessary infrastructure for developing and creating services.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I commend the work of the National Economic and Social Forum, particularly its recent report on early childhood care and education which sets out clearly the challenges facing our changing society in respect of such education. Recognising the consequences of our rapidly changing society as the context for our endeavours is the first step.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The NESF paints a clear picture. The population is at its highest level since 1871 and our birth rate has been increasing since 1994. Children under six years comprise some 10% of the population. Our population is becoming increasingly urbanised with 60% of the population living in urban centres in 2002. Our changing society and rapidly developing economy has changed the environment for early childhood learning. The number of women working outside the home rose from 483,000 in 1995 to 771,000 in 2004, an increase of 60%.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I commend the Government and the Minister for Education and Science on asking the Dublin Institute of Technology and St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, to jointly establish the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education in 2001. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has referred to the great achievements in this regard. This body works as centre of excellence to develop a quality framework for early childhood education; to develop targeted interventions for children who are educationally disadvantaged and for children with special needs. The publication by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment of the Framework for Early Learning is to be welcomed. This sets out the basis for the first national framework for learning from birth to six years. Groups such as the NESF, the National Children's Office, the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education and many other excellent groups can point out to legislators the challenges to be faced. Parents, families and teachers inform us as legislators of the immediate concerns for children and their education. I recognise that at less than 0.2% of GDP, our investment in early childhood education needs to be reconsidered. I realise that the wider setting of the child must be considered. As the NESF report suggests, if we are to do all we can for early childhood learning, we need to further examine the factors that contribute to, or undermine, the well-being of children in contemporary Irish families. Irish society has changed quite dramatically in the past 20 years. We must devise and implement effective and responsive policies relating to children and to the design of services for children and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I am particularly delighted that, through the National Children's Office, the Government is funding a national longitudinal study on children. This will be the most significant of its kind to be undertaken, particularly in terms of the cost, scope and the extent of the period to be studied. In the words of the NESF report, we need to look at, "the care and education needs of young children in an enlightened way, identifying and removing the inadequacies and rigidities". As policymakers we must commend the work of the national longitudinal study, ensure we have an enlightened attitude and also be brave and forthright in identifying and removing the inadequacies and rigidities.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I am conscious of the general link between early learning and child care. The Government has made a greater commitment to the child care sector through the equal opportunities childcare programme, than any other in the history of the State. In line with promises made during the general election, the Government has kept State funding on child care under continual review and has recently committed to increased spending. At least €500 million will have been spent on the EOCP by the end of 2006. Even then the Government's investment in child care will not stop. In the last budget the Government, through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, secured a commitment to further increase capital funding under the next phase of the equal opportunities child care programme, which will start officially in 2007. The funding allocated under the 2000-06 programme will result in the creation of some 36,500 new child care places, many of which are already <i>in situ.</i>

          <p eId="para_220">The NESF's call for enlightenment and courage puts the onus on us all to work to address the problems in the system. My party, the Progressive Democrats, has outlined a five-point approach to do this in regard to child care. In the coming days we will develop further our ideas on increasing supply to reduce costs and burden on families to improve the context within which all our policy endeavours must sit. We will examine reforms to address distinctiveness to supply and reforms to incentivise the provision of nurturing environments for childhood learning within the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">I welcome these statements. This is a complex area. There are statutory and voluntary groups who do great work and provide excellent information for legislators. We have a duty to act on that information. I am certain that further progress will be made in early childhood learning.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_222">Like other speakers, I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the statements on this important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">This is not the first time we have touched on this subject. The recent report published by the National Economic and Social Forum has allowed us to focus on one part of a broad area of social policy, namely caring for children, for which the term "child care" has become shorthand, with which we are only now coming to terms. It is extraordinary that we are only now waking up to the neglect of this extremely important area of social policy. When I was a journalist in the 1980s and the parent of young children, I tried to interest newspapers in carrying an article on child care and occasionally I was successful. The issues at that time concerned finding a child care place and the regulation and quality of child care facilities and they continued to be the issues for some time. Until relatively recently child care was, to a large extent, a minority issue because there was not the same level, as there is currently, of participation by mothers in the workforce. The increased level of their participation in the workforce has caught up with us very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">A recently published report by the National Women's Council of Ireland, which I commend for its major contribution to this debate, pointed out that traditionally, the care of children was exclusively the concern of parents and,as policymakers, successive Governments have left it to parents to make their own private arrangements for the care of their children while they go out to work. However, we can no longer do that because of the number of parents working and the fact that this is having an economic impact. It is a regrettable that it is the economic impact caused by the lack of a child care infrastructure that has put this issue on the agenda rather than the issue in its own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">This debate is good because we have narrowed the issue to focus on early childhood education which has been largely neglected. We have an excellent primary education system but until the establishment of the early childhood development unit in Drumcondra we did not examine the importance of and the measures to be introduced to provide for the education and care of very young children. However, we are dealing with this issue now and we have a unique opportunity to put in place the best possible infrastructure and delivery in terms of child care. I do not see why we cannot aspire to achieving that, given the backdrop of the level of prosperity and economic activity against which we are working.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">The Government has a certain level of income, which I hope future Governments will have, but that will be only possible if the child care infrastructure issue is dealt with. Assuming it is dealt with, this and future Governments will have available to them the resources to put in place the best possible child care infrastructure in the world. That should be the foundation for our economy going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">We also have an extraordinary opportunity to eliminate childhood poverty and, in many ways, we have a moral responsibility to do so. We have the resources and ability to tackle and eliminate childhood poverty. We have only to look across the water at what the British Government has done to deal with this issue in recent years and compare that to the limited progress made in the United States due to the fairly minimal investment made there. Targeted investment in child care in disadvantaged areas can be effective in tackling poverty at source. We have a moral responsibility to do that. We can do it now and we should. I hope that an initiative to this effect will be put forward by the Government shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The recently published NESF report is a major contribution to this debate. I commend all those who worked on it and produced a valuable addition to the debate on this issue. The press release issued by NESF at midnight on Sunday, 25 September posed the question, what progress has been made on implementing early childhood education policy, to which the answer is very little. The press releases states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_229">The child care sector is weakly regulated and conceived mainly as a service for working mothers. The NESF report concludes that there has been little progress in relation to the implementation of the policy decisions set out in the Government White Paper on ... [early childhood care and education] in 1999, instead we have had "a picture of inaction, peripheral implementation and drift".</p>
          <p eId="para_230">That is a quote from the NESF report and not my version of events. It is the level we are at. There has been inaction, peripheral implementation and drift. Small bits have been done in an <i>ad hoc </i> fashion without any overall thrust in terms of delivery. Other Senators pointed to the absence of a single Department or Ministry with responsibility for implementing child care policy. I believe that is a missed opportunity. However, it is possible to put in place an agency that would be answerable to one Minister and clearly, the Minister for Education and Science has a major role in this area. A single ministry or a well resourced, high-powered agency is required to deliver the necessary infrastructure which we have only started to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The county child care committees, which took many years to put in place, are working well and are delivering the equal opportunities childcare programme. It is an <i>ad hoc</i> programme devised within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am delighted it was devised there because if it was not I do not know where we would be. I wish to mention a public servant, Ms Sylda Langford and pay tribute to the work she has done virtually single-handedly because of her passion for this area. Without her drive and energy this would not be happening. Much has been said about the public service but in terms of an individual who has made a major contribution, she should be singled out in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">It is an anomaly that child care is being delivered from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is being delivered from a single unit and, as pointed out, €500 million has been spent. An examination of the operation of the equal opportunities child care programme reveals the results of good capital investment throughout the country in terms of the delivery of child care centres. However, there is a significant problem regarding the continuity of service because there is a reliance on people participating in community employment schemes to staff these centres. I am on the board of the Nenagh Childcare Centre which is located in an excellent state of the art building on a site donated by the county council and it is fabulously well managed. Of the 22 full-time staff, 17 are community employment workers. I do not have a problem with that as they are all well trained and they are doing an excellent job. Nevertheless, that illustrates the fine balance on which such centres are operating. We need far more investment at that level, particularly in terms of what those publicly funded centres can deliver to target disadvantage and support families who are disadvantaged, not in ghettoised context but in a broader community context. Excellent work is being done in regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I point out to the Minister of State what I have said before here, namely, that the equal opportunities child care programme is barely a start. The county child care committees are also barely a start. While the investment made appears significant, it is only scratching the surface of the investment required to provide what needs to be done. This issue needs to be viewed in the wider context of a range of measures, including maternity leave, parental leave, paternity leave, flexible working and family friendly work policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">I ask the Government to look at what is happening in Britain. I do not propose that we should do what they are doing. However, we should look at what is working and what is not. In particular, we should look at the Sure Start programme from which the results have been spectacular within a very short timeframe. There is a core issue for us to look at from the viewpoint of social policy and the opportunities we have. One thinks of the introduction of free education and the difference it has made to this country over an entire generation. Perhaps quite a number of the Members in this Chamber would not have got the education they did if this had not been available to them. We should also consider the high priority given to education in Ireland and what this has delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">However, a key part of the puzzle is missing, namely, the smallest citizen and the earliest opportunity to invest in education. This is in interesting contrast to Britain and presents some key dilemmas for us. My recollection is that the CSO figures show that 50% of children under five are cared for by their parents at home. The remaining 50% are cared for in a variety of settings — crèches, relations, friends, the usual. We are still considering what the best possible arrangements should be, particularly for very small children. I hope we can have a reasoned debate on that whole issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">The National Women's Council proposes that those who choose not to stay at home for the first year of an infant's life should have access to a well regulated and supported child care option. There is an issue to be addressed as regards the so-called stay at home parent. This needs to be looked at in terms of supports. It is not simply an economic issue. It is an issue of social policy that has to do with the care of children. It clearly has to do with parents being in the workforce, but that is not the only dynamic at work here. We are at a point when progress may be made on this issue and something extraordinary can be created, not only for children, but for the whole community.</p>

        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_237">I welcome the Minister of State. I believe we should concentrate on what can be done for children from the time they are born up to the age of six. Where have matters gone wrong? These are the types of questions I was turning over in my mind as I listened to this debate. Conditions have changed dramatically for Irish society in recent years. There is the population increase, the prolonged commuting from satellite towns as well as the enormous economic growth. Taking all that into account we appear to have forgotten how best to manage and provide early childhood care and education for the age cohort, zero to six. This involves dialogue and consultation with the parents and child care providers as well as the various Departments concerned. The Government has been committed on this. We have seen examples through the White Paper on early childhood education and the Early Start programme. There was also a Cabinet sub-committee on children which dealt with all these recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">However, we are still not getting matters right. This is nobody's fault as successive Governments have made attempts through the years. It is crucial, as everyone today has said, to set up one Department, without delay. Within that Department there should, perhaps, be a unit for early child development to deal with how to set out programmes and provide an inspectorate for monitoring them. The question of day-to-day administration in terms of the adult child ratio should be reviewed. How do parents feel about these early programmes? So far in this discussion there has been very little linking with parents, as such. Once parents have a new baby they must decide whether they want to stay at home. If so, they must learn how they may be best facilitated as regards grants, etc. It is crucially important not to overlook the mother who wishes to stay at home. This has not been addressed so far. The debate has focused very much on matters outside the home. I hope the Minister will bear in mind that the mother is the key person to be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The local element is also vitally important. Centres should be kept to link up with the local authorities, for example, through the county development boards. These were very much in evidence when I was a councillor in South County Dublin where areas for local child care crèches were provided for under the county development plans, with the requisite providers and programmes, as necessary. This is an area that needs to be decentralised as much as possible. I would also like to see a reform of the infant class system, as referred to in the NESF report. Perhaps a pre-school programme might be introduced within the infant class system. Two programmes could be established, which would allow children to come to school at three years of age. This needs to be teased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Child and family centres should be established to provide an integrated service, particularly in disadvantaged areas, where the Early Start programmes have begun. The concept is very good, but somewhat scrappy. I do not know whether it is meant to have pilot schemes or if they are up and running everywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">We need an integrated policy, one Department and to enter into discussion with employers on flexitime and how best to help young mothers. If they want to do a couple of hours in the day perhaps they can work at home. An evaluation and monitoring system is needed within whatever Department is set up. There must be an inspectorate to evaluate what types of programmes are being introduced within the crèches. This is very important. It is not always a question of money, but rather how a proper policy may be implemented. At present it is very fragmented. There are good fundamental points in this discussion and in this report. Let us work on those. A good child care service can be introduced and it is not always about money.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_242">I welcome this report on early childhood, care and education. It is startling that the report shows that we have the highest population level since 1871, with children under the age of six accounting for 10%. The number of women working outside the home has increased by 60% in recent years. This is a reflection on the Government's poor planning, where it went out of its way to encourage more women into the workforce while not matching this with increased and improved child care facilities. The schools building programme is still in turmoil. Then there is the Government's broken promises as regards the pupil-teacher ratio, which applies in particular to younger classes. I am sure that Senator Fitzgerald, on the other side of the House, a former teacher like myself, will agree with me on that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">—fully supports the family of the late Joseph Rafferty in its quest for justice;</p>
          <p eId="para_251">—condemns any intimidation of the family and calls for it to cease immediately;</p>

          <p eId="para_257">—and calls on everyone, but particularly on Sinn Féin, who has any awareness of or contact with persons who might be in a position to assist the Garda investigation to use their influence to that effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">It is a matter of considerable progress that this motion has been agreed in the names of the Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Independent Senators. It is crucial that the message to emerge from the House during this two hour debate is that all Senators and political parties represented in the House are at one with the Rafferty family in its quest for justice for its murdered brother. It is significant that Senators have agreed to table a joint motion in the names of all party leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">Over the past three weeks members of the Rafferty family have met the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Kenny, the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, and other politicians to highlight their campaign to ensure they get justice for their murdered brother. I welcome members of the family, who are seated in the public gallery, to the House. They have shown remarkable courage in the face of intimidation and abuse from the republican movement since the murder of their brother in April this year and deserve our respect and support. I also welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and thank him and his officials for facilitating agreement on the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The campaign of the Rafferty family has one objective and one mission statement. It seeks to secure justice for its brother, an innocent man who was murdered in April this year. I pay tribute to its campaigning zeal and forbearance. I also congratulate Councillor Gary Keegan of the Fianna Fáil Party on his diligence in constantly raising this issue which recently acquired prominence on Dublin City Council, a proper forum in which to raise it. I acknowledge CouncillorKeegan's contribution and the manner in which he has represented his community and supported the Rafferty family.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Joseph Rafferty had no involvement in crime. Just after his murder the republican movement in the south inner city put out a dirty slur that he was a drug dealer. He never had any involvement in crime or drugs and was an honest, hard-working 29 year old man who had set up his own business in recent years, owned his own property and was a good father to his four year old daughter whom he provided with a home. He was murdered in cold blood on 12 April as he left his home. The only crime he committed was to get in the way of Sinn Féin-IRA which did not like the fact that a personal altercation took place. I am not suggesting that the army council took a corporate decision to murder Mr. Rafferty but the fact remains that one individual took it upon himself to murder him simply because he got in the way of the kind of intimidation that these people mete out on a daily and monthly basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Initially, Sinn Féin stated it had no involvement in the crime and that remains the position of Mr. Adams and the leadership of his party. There is, however, a history in this regard. In recent years, the party has consistently denied involvement when the IRA or an out of control IRA activist murdered an individual. Its first response to the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was to deny involvement until it became clear that those prosecuted for the crime were activists who belonged to the republican movement. Sinn Féin also denied any involvement in a recent case before the Special Criminal Court which involved individuals who took part in surveillance of elected Members of the Oireachtas. They were found guilty in a court of law on charges connected with membership of a proscribed organisation and surveillance of elected officials. I understand the latest demand from Mr. Adams and Deputy Ó Caoláin is that the individuals in question should be released from prison, even though they were convicted in the Special Criminal Court of serious offences in the recent past.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Sinn Féin also denied involvement in the murder of Mr. Robert McCartney in Belfast, which the party described as a bar room brawl until it became abundantly clear that Sinn Féin-IRA activists were responsible. In all of these cases, Sinn Féin has lied, as it has lied in the case of Mr. Rafferty, to save its bacon and used the cloak of ordinary politics as a means of explaining that it had no involvement. It did not wash in the past and does not wash now. They have a direct responsibility to ensure those responsible for this horrendous crime against Joseph Rafferty in April are brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The family of Joseph Rafferty went to the local Sinn Féin councillor on three occasions outlining to him the intimidation and threats being made against his life and asked that representative to do everything in his power to ensure he would not be a victim of violence. This has become the subject of much controversy between the local Sinn Féin councillor and the family in recent months. Last night on television news the councillor in question said he did not speak to anyone at all when the matter was first raised with him in spite of his claiming that he could assure the family there was no republican involvement in the case. If he did not speak to any third party, how could he assume there was no republican involvement?</p>
          <p eId="para_265">It is important to state that the Rafferty family was badly let down by this councillor, who looked the other way when they came looking for help concerning the intimidation of their brother. The same councillor continues to leaflet the community on this case despite the family asking him not to do so. It is late in the day for that councillor and Sinn Féin to cry over this case when for five months he and the party sat back and did nothing. When the specific intimidation claims were brought to Sinn Féin's attention, it did nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">It is inherent on all of us to expose republican gangsterism wherever it raises its ugly head. It is the responsibility of this House, the other House and the democratic parties that have served this State to say that we will not put up with this in the new post-Agreement Ireland. A small group of gangsters, and that is exactly what they are, feel that they have a right in some working class communities to act as judge and jury and as policemen; they are none of those and we must expose that fact. We must put pressure on the republican community to ensure prosecutions come from this case and also ensure that its involvement, whereby a known Sinn Féin-IRA activist was involved in the deliberate assassination of Joseph Rafferty, is recognised. If Mr. Adams, Mr. McGuinness and the Sinn Féin leadership would recognise that it would go a long way towards heeling the appalling pain that has been visited upon the Rafferty family since the murder in April.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">With those words I open the debate. I look forward to the contributions and unequivocal support that will come for this motion given that it has been agreed by all groups.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I am pleased that all of us in this House can find common cause on this important issue and like Senator Brian Hayes, I pay tribute to the members of Joseph Rafferty's family, who are here today, and to councillor Gary Keegan who has done so much to help them in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I welcome this opportunity to discuss the facts surrounding this horrendous murder. JosephRafferty, a young 29-year-old man, was brutally shot dead outside his home on the morning of 12 April last as he left for work. The Garda Síochána immediately launched a major murder investigation, with an incident room established in Lucan Garda station. This was a cold-blooded murder and, as I shall chronicle, it was a death foretold.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Senators will appreciate that I am, of necessity, somewhat circumscribed in what I can say about the progress of the Garda investigation and where — and to whom — it may lead. What I can say, however, is that the Garda authorities believe that suspicion for this crime points strongly to a disagreement between the deceased's family and another family, among the latter of whom are persons well known to be Sinn Féin activists.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The facts speak for themselves. As the lawyers would say, <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>. There is no doubt nor argument, for example, that in the weeks immediately before the brutal murder of Joseph Rafferty and as a consequence of the disagreement that existed between the families, explicit violent threats were made against members of the extended Rafferty family in which the name of the Provisional IRA was clearly invoked.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">These threats had the chilling effect of putting that family in such fear and trepidation for its safety that members approached a local Sinn Féin city councillor in an attempt to get the threats lifted. That Sinn Féin local representative gave the family certain assurances, the burdens of which are now disputed between him and the family. The family are clear, however, and I accept their view, that he offered to help to get the threats by his associates lifted. He has an entirely different version of their dialogue. Sadly, as we know, despite this dialogue and the family's desperate efforts to save him, Joseph Rafferty was murdered.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">It is also a fact that following the brutal murder members of the family once again approached Sinn Féin local representatives, this time to seek their help in bringing the perpetrators to justice. It is a further fact that members of the family were subjected to intimidation following the murder as they sought to illuminate the truth of what had happened and in their quest for justice for Joseph. It is also the case that the Sinn Féin councillor approached by the family publicly stated that he would co-operate with the Garda investigation. That co-operation, at least to date, has extended to providing no more than an uninformative, perfunctory written statement which has done nothing to progress the murder investigation by the gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">While, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have received important information on the murder from the Garda, I am not in a position to say too much about the Garda investigation. I do not want to say or do anything that might in any way prejudice the outcome and the objective of bringing the killer to justice. I can say, however, that a chief suspect in this case remains someone who would be regarded as a member of the IRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Whether or not IRA or Sinn Féin members were involved in the murder of Joseph Rafferty will ultimately be a matter for the Garda Síochána and the courts. One thing, however, is not in doubt. The family of the late Joseph Rafferty, like the families of countless victims of the IRA in the North, passionately believed that Sinn Féin public representatives had the ability to exert influence on the hard men in local communities - the hard men associated with the IRA and who have a reputation for dealing with so-called problems, usually at the end of a baseball bat. It is one of the enduring legacies of the so-called armed campaign of the IRA that it has placed whole communities in the North of Ireland in the thrall of these men, who swagger around their communities as if they are untouchable. I want to send a message to any member of the IRA in this jurisdiction who thinks he can emulate his Northern counterparts, to think again. There is only one police force and one system of justice in this Republic, and its members do not wear balaclavas as a badge of office.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">It is important for me to acknowledge, however, that it is at this point at least the professional assessment of the Garda authorities that the killing of Joseph Rafferty was not, as Senator Brian Hayes concedes, an operation sanctioned by the Provisional IRA and that it was carried out without the tacit approval of the Provisional IRA. Senators know my track record on the Provisionals and know equally well that I count myself among the front ranks of their resolute opponents. I do not, therefore, say lightly what I have just said. I am as equally committed to upholding the truth as I am to defeating the criminal legacy of the paramilitaries, and the assessment — at least in as much as one can be made at this stage — is that the killing of this young man was not a sanctioned act of the Provisional IRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">This Garda view has nothing to do with the recent, very positive events regarding decommissioning. I will say more on this important and happy subject later, but without a doubt, the report of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning was extremely positive, and it potentially heralds a new dawn in the political landscape of the island. However, we should not and will not allow this development to overshadow the wrongs that remain, for they are many and serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">There are very disturbing parallels between the killing of Joseph Rafferty and the killing of Robert McCartney in Belfast last January. That horrific act also was not a prior sanctioned murder by the IRA, but we all know the lengths to which members of that organisation went to cover up the awful deed and the attempts still going on to intimidate the family into silence. In the McCartney case, there is no doubt people, as well as those immediately responsible for the killing and the subsequent cover-up, have information that could prove extremely useful to the PSNI in bringing the perpetrators to justice. However, those same people either choose not to divulge the information in their possession or are afraid to make statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">As Senator Brian Hayes stated, the reaction of the Provisional IRA to that murder should be remembered. It went from outright denial of any involvement to a private offer to the family to shoot those considered responsible who ranked among its number. It then put it on public record via a P. O'Neill press release. It is to the enduring credit of the McCartney sisters and Robert's grieving partner that they spurned out of hand that depraved and obscene offer from the IRA. The insistence by the McCartney family that justice can only be served through the machinery of the criminal justice system, including full co-operation with the PSNI, demonstrates the absolute necessity to uphold the rule of law in tackling vicious crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">In the case of the murder of Joseph Rafferty, I am certain there are people in the Sinn Féin-Provisional IRA movement who possess information invaluable to the Garda investigation. However, they continue to remain silent, refuse to make signed statements or simply look the other way. If they do so out of a sense of loyalty, whether political or personal, then it is a perverted sense of loyalty that speaks volumes for the values of the organisation, political or military, which they support. There are others who are simply too frightened to cross the thugs who invoke the name of the IRA. No good can come from aiding and abetting the heinous crime of murder. To do so only further victimises the Rafferty family.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Like the family of Robert McCartney, the family of Joseph Rafferty deserve our praise and recognition for the courageous manner in which they have sought to honour the memory of this young man in the best means possible by seeking to secure justice for him in death, when it was not available before. To this end, they have launched a campaign for justice involving, among other fora, the national daily newspapers. In doing so, they have been instrumental in maintaining public focus on this case which could have easily slipped into obscurity.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">This is despite the family being subject to blatant intimidation. Senators are doubly right, therefore, to condemn the intimidation directed at the family. I had the honour of meeting privately with some members of the Rafferty family in June last at their request. During this meeting a portrait of intimidation was painted which I found very frightening. To think this is happening in Dublin city and those involved believe they can do so with impunity is frightening. To counter these threats, the Garda authorities increased the level of foot and mobile patrols in the immediate vicinity. Moreover, two persons linked to the murder investigation are before the courts for offences that include elements of intimidation. TheRafferty family has received assistance from a support organisation dedicated specifically to the needs of the families of murder victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The Government is doing all in its power to promote the full and frank disclosure of any information, held by whomever, that could be of assistance to the Garda investigation. Last week at our meeting with the leadership of Sinn Féin, first the Taoiseach, and then I, specifically raised the murder of Joseph Rafferty. Does this very act not point to how far Sinn Féin has yet to progress before it can be regarded as a political party on a par with other parties represented in this Parliament? It should not be the stuff of ordinary politics that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform feel it is necessary to make clear to the Sinn Féin leadership that it is beyond doubt that the victim's family believed with good cause they were in fear of attack from persons associated with the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin but unfortunately it is. We stressed how family members went to Sinn Féin seeking assurances that intimidation and threats would be lifted and how, according to family members, they were given those assurances by a Sinn Féin local representative.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Notwithstanding this, the harsh and terrible reality is that Joseph Rafferty was murdered. I also made it clear to the Sinn Féin delegation that the family reported continuing threats and intimidation by people linked to the so-called republican movement. I went on to insist that Sinn Féin must use whatever influence it has in the community to ensure those associated with that organisation immediately end any form of intimidation of the Rafferty family and co-operate fully with the Garda investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">It must be borne in mind that the Rafferty family have informed me, and have made it known publicly, that prior to this they would have voted for Sinn Féin. The McCartney family were also in the same position. I am not making political hay but we have a long way to go if people must ask individual councillors to call off the hounds of war, even after disarmament. Yesterday the Taoiseach separately met with theRaffertys to support their ongoing campaign for justice. He has expressed his commitment to the case and undertook to provide whatever support he can to the family, in the expectation the perpetrators will be brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">A state of affairs in which any family would go to any public representative to ask persons whom they believe are associated with or influenced by that public representative, not to murder their loved one, is an appalling one. I did not create that situation nor did the Rafferty family. They are not pursuing some political agenda as it is clear that until recently they would have given their vote to the people who have let them down so badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">What kind of society do we want? Are we prepared to live under the yoke of bullying, violence and intimidation as part of the ordinary life? Why should there be corners of north and south Dublin inner city where some people are condemned to live under the shadow of thuggery, violence and killing? There is no good reason for this. The people who can do most to bring about an end to this psychology and domination of local communities are the people who are closest politically to those who carry out these terrible acts. If one is a republican, as I claim to be, one cannot talk about societies in which one citizen walks down the street afraid of other citizens or in which one politician has associates who can or cannot be dissuaded from murdering or beating up other citizens' loved ones. This is anti-republican and a betrayal of the tricolour. It stands for everything republicanism is not. These people have nothing to with what Pearse did in 1916, Davis did in 1848 or Tone did in 1798. They are abusing and betraying the term "republic" to perpetrate a form of brown-shirted tyranny on communities with a view to dominating them.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I salute the Rafferty family for standing up to them. I pledge them every support I can possibly give them, consistent with the independent investigation and prosecution of offences by the organs of law appointed under our Constitution.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_293">However, members of a certain political party still use the phrase. Even as they say there is only one army, they then talk of Óglaigh na hÉireann as belonging to them. It does not belong to them. Neither does it belong to the Government. Óglaigh na hÉireann belongs to the people through the Constitution. Only through the Constitution and constitutionally elected Governments, that can also be constitutionally deposed, can one have an army that is truly accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Anything else is a licence for what the Minister is talking about. Let us not heed people who say we are in transition. There is an old phrase that those who would sup with the devil should use a long spoon. People who found these psychopathic thugs useful in their political endeavours cannot say they are no longer connected with them. They are connected with them as long as they tolerate their continuing psychopathic thuggery by their silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Let us not pretend that the murder of Joseph Rafferty is the only thing that was done. The current Member of Dáil Éireann for Kerry North was once able to persuade people by the eloquence of his words to hand back stolen goods, apparently by simply appealing to their better nature. Suddenly incorrigible thieves discovered a new side to themselves, handed back the stolen goods and we are supposed to believe it was because of eloquence and persuasion. A member of the same political party not far from Cork reported a drugs incident to the Garda Síochána and the dealer assaulted one of his children. Then the drug dealer was approached by a man in a balaclava and warned as to the consequences of beating up a 16 year old again. These people think that is a great thing to do and swagger around saying as much. Every time they do that they are not just attacking individuals or families but that which keeps us safe. In a political dialogue where I disagree with much of what the Government does, as I will continue to do with varying degrees of coherence, it is a fundamental principle that none of us feels any other member is or implies a physical threat or would even contemplate so doing, whether in the political arena or outside.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Their ambivalence is crystallised in the unbelievable denial of the Sinn Féin leader that he was ever a member of the IRA. How can we have a political party led by somebody who says something that is so much at variance with the conviction of everybody in politics, and everyone I know outside politics who lives in Northern Ireland, who says he was not only a member but an extremely influential member? We can leave that to history but I cannot leave the denial of an unchallengeable fact in the eyes of everybody I know apart from this one individual. That is the fundamental problem. None of us is an angel but one political party claims to itself a right to manipulate the truth in a way the rest of us would not even attempt. We are all in the emotionally and physically demanding business of confrontational democratic politics but none of us claims the right to rewrite history. I am entirely tired of a political party which tells the Minister, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and particularly the Labour Party what they did wrong for the past 20 years but, when asked about its own activities in that period, says we must now look forward. Its members look back at everybody else's behaviour but their own. They have given up arms they never should have had or used. As Senator Brian Hayes said these were arms for the use of which there was never a scintilla of moral justification.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I reiterate what Senator Dardis said that the decision of RTE's Northern correspondent to use the name of Gerry Adams and Mahatma Gandhi in the same sentence was one of the most outrageously disgusting things I have ever heard.</p>

My two greatest heroes are Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Both achieved enormous change in their societies but said it was not morally justifiable to kill one person to achieve that change. The idea that a man who tells lies about his past and who leads a party that was directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people could even be mentioned in the same sentence as Gandhi, let alone afforded the political adulation that was tagged on at the end of the piece, is among the most appalling editorial decisions I have seen from RTE for a long time. It deserves to be dealt with with the utmost firmness by anyone in RTE who believes it needs to be balanced in reporting the news.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I live about 160 miles from Dublin so I cannot add anything to the discussion on the murder of Joseph Rafferty except that it is wonderful to see people taking their courage in their hands in the face of disgusting intimidation and saying they will no longer be silenced. I met the McCartney sisters and they are wonderfully impressive people. I have never met Joseph Rafferty's family but they are brave people.

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_303">I join with other speakers in sympathising with the members of the Rafferty family. This is obviously a personal tragedy for them and is particularly traumatic for Joseph's child, who will never know his father. It puts into perspective the heinousness of such crimes. I commend other Senators on the courage with which they have taken a stand in exposing those who were involved in this terrible crime so that they can be brought to justice. The intimidation suffered by the family subsequent to the murder, which compounds the felony, bears all the hallmarks of the murder of Robert McCartney earlier this year. In that regard I compliment Councillor Gary Keegan and his colleagues on Dublin City Council, who are here today, in condemning both the atrocity itself and the intimidation. Someone once said that for evil to prosper all it takes is for good men to remain silent. In this instance Mr. Keegan and his colleagues on Dublin City Council have performed a good service and confounded that adage.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">It is interesting that we are debating this issue because this week we have seen the decommissioning of IRA arms. This is hopefully a sea change in the transformation of the attitude between communities and the climate in which people live their lives on this island, particularly north of the Border. It is not sufficient just to decommission arms, and Sinn Féin itself has described it as a step in a process. What is more essential, but probably more difficult, is the need to decommission mindsets. As a person who would describe himself as a republican from a very early age, I am offended by the murder being discussed this evening and that of others such as Robert McCartney. These events offend any basic principle of republicanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The IRA undoubtedly comprises in part idealists who felt they were fighting a just cause against the British Government. However, as others have stated here, it also contains an element of thuggery which feels it is above the law and that its type of justice will be administered. This is unacceptable in any civilised society, let alone a democratic society. This message must go out clearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">I participated in a debate on the murder of Robert McCartney, among other issues on Northern Ireland, on local radio over the summer with some representatives of Sinn Féin. I stated at that time that if Sinn Féin was serious about restoring public confidence in the peace process, co-operation with the PSNI in identifying those responsible for the murder of Robert McCartney and ensuring they were brought to justice would be one of the best ways to bring such public confidence about. Republicans must be seen to be acting in a way that will restore confidence even to cynics. If the people on this island are to move forward together, it must be done in a spirit of trust, which must now be earned. Prices have been exacted in the past and trust will not and should not come for free.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Another opportunity for trust arises in possible co-operation with the Garda to ensure that those responsible for the murder of Joseph Rafferty are also brought to justice. If this co-operation comes about, a scene will be set for Sinn Féin that will entitle it to political support and full participation in the democratic process. I hope this happens in the future. It is essential for several reasons. Much of what has been seen in Northern Ireland over the summer does not inspire confidence. The level of loyalist activity, including murders, is often not discussed or criticised either side of the Border, and the evident sectarianism would blight any society. My party recently hosted a delegation headed by the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. The deputation met other parties in this House. I put the point to the delegation that there was a dearth of leadership within Unionism that could attempt to lead the movement from the abyss of sectarianism, which certainly blights Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">All sides must be seen to be moving towards a more civilized and democratic approach to governance within the island. Seeing what is going on now and what has gone on over the past 30 years, the number of Catholic families forced to leave their houses is an indictment of 80 years, or even centuries, of British rule in that part of the island. I would like to see this rule ended, but to achieve this, a republican element cannot operate outside the law, bringing hardship and trauma to families such as the Rafferty family. Many more would empathise with the pain suffered by that family. Such criminal actions should be brought to an end and I hope this will occur in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">There is also an obligation on legislators, and I am glad that the motion has been changed to a composite motion. We have an obligation to the Rafferty family and all other families who are victims of crime. The obligation is to ensure that legislation is crafted in a way that avoids maladministration of justice and situations where people who are guilty of heinous and serious crimes are able to walk the streets with impunity because of a lacuna in the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I am glad the Minister has placed on record that this murder was not an organisational decision by Sinn Féin but rather by elements within it, as this gives the party an opportunity to use its influence to see that the elements operating outside the law are brought to justice. It is only when this happens that the party can command the respect any political party in a civilised society should.</p>

        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_98">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_311">Many of my words will echo the remarks of previous speakers and the Minister. It is absolutely fitting that the motion before us is an all-party motion which every party in the House fully supports. The decommissioning of IRA weapons must be welcomed by all right-thinking people. It was long overdue and hopefully the IRA and Sinn Féin will abandon, along with the weapons and explosives, the other criminal activities which have wreaked much misery and hardship on families, individuals and communities north and south of the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">We must be absolutely sure that paramilitary groups know that there is so much more to normalizing conditions in the North and elsewhere than declaring a ceasefire and abandoning weapons. Unfortunately, many IRA members have lost sight of their political goal and became more concerned with the type of illegal activity that has seen banks robbed, shops vandalised, families from all communities threatened and intimidated, punishment beatings, abductions and, most tragically, murders and executions.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Many of the families of these victims of murder were further tortured by never seeing their loved ones again, as men in balaclavas shattered the peace in their homes. They stole husbands from their wives, mothers from their children and brothers from their sisters. The disappeared were a harsh reminder of the cruel, callous and wholly ruthless attitude of the IRA towards its victims. Despite the fact that republican political leaders refused to condemn such activities and denied any responsibility, they claimed that the IRA had ended its campaign of violence. It is time that the republican leaders realised that this kind of activity is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by ordinary Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">A very public example of this was when the IRA walked into a public house in Belfast in January and stabbed a 33 year old father, Robert McCartney. For months, the IRA and Sinn Féin leadership denied any involvement of their members in the killing, hollowly calling for anyone with information to come forward and aid the investigation although they stopped short of telling people to go to the PSNI. It was only through the dogged determination of Robert McCartney's sisters, who were not afraid to expose the murderers for what they were and who never desisted in their search for their brother's murderers, that Sinn Féin finally, in a somewhat empty gesture, expelled some members from the organisation in April.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Despite the insistent claims of the Sinn Féin leadership that none of its members would be involved in such activity, it was finally revealed that a criminal element within republicanism was not just alive and well but was active and prowling the streets of our towns and cities, distributing its own brand of vigilante punishments to those it felt deserved it. Ultimately, these people were shown up for what they were — nothing more than thugs and bullies who think they have the right to behave in that fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">At the same time that Sinn Féin was expelling members for their involvement in Robert McCartney's murder, 28 year old Joseph Rafferty was vindictively shot dead by a gunman as he left his family home on 12 April. As with Robert McCartney, when Joseph Rafferty's family pointed the finger at the IRA, the usual platitudes were trotted out about how republicanism would not be involved in such a murder and how it was no longer involved in paramilitary activity. Some of its members have strongly denied that the man suspected of Mr. Rafferty's murder is in the IRA and some Sinn Féin members of Dublin City Council stated that they would resign if the killer proved to be an active member of Sinn Féin. All the while, Mr. Rafferty's family suffered intimidation and a stonewalling silence from the Sinn Féin leadership when they went looking for answers. Does Sinn Féin think that anyone will believe it was not involved simply because it says so? We have heard it all before and now we want action from Sinn Féin, not simply empty commitments and promises.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The Garda has stated that its suspect is a former member of the IRA who retains close links to the organisation. The Minister has said something similar in this House this evening. Let us not beat around the bush. I call for Sinn Féin to come clean for once and to give the Garda the information it has concerning this man, irrespective of whether he is a current, former, occasional or visiting member of Sinn Féin or indeed the IRA. Ultimately, the murder of Joseph Rafferty bears uncanny similarities to that of Robert McCartney. Thus far, there has been little or no support for the family from the leadership of Sinn Féin. It is about time this changed. Mr. Rafferty's family has the right to see justice done and I call upon Sinn Féin this evening — and anyone else who may have information — to do what they can to ensure the murder is solved and the guilty party is brought to justice.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_99">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_318">I also welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate Fine Gael for tabling this motion. I am delighted it is now a composite motion to which all Members can agree and support. No one who is aware of my views and those of the Progressive Democrats will be surprised that I will use this opportunity to restate my absolute belief that our democracy must be carefully protected from the caustic actions of the IRA and Sinn Féin. As the House has heard, Joseph Rafferty was shot dead in west Dublin on 12 April. He was shot twice in the upper body. His family has stated that he was told that he would be shot dead. Garda sources have confirmed to the national media that the suspect in the Rafferty murder was an IRA member. The dead man's family state that the suspect has been active in Sinn Féin and that Sinn Féin is shielding the person who shot Mr. Rafferty. The Rafferty family claims it has been the victim of alleged IRA intimidation in the south inner city neighbourhood.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">These are the awful facts. The Raffertys have been through a very difficult time and continue to suffer. We must do everything we can to help them. That includes voicing, in the strongest possible terms, our utter disgust at this cold-blooded murder and any party's action which frustrates the search for justice. Everyone has a duty to help the Raffertys, including Sinn Féin and the IRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">When I saw the Rafferty family at Government Buildings last Tuesday, holding aloft a photograph of Joseph, my mind instantly turned to the McCartneys. Following a meeting in Belfast with the McCartney sisters, Mr. Rafferty's sister stated that her brother's murder was a carbon copy of the Robert McCartney killing. After that meeting, Catherine McCartney said the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_321">The incidents around Joseph's death are very similar to our own... We are talking about the murder of two men... For our two cases, murder is murder and can only be sorted out by the rule of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Ms McCartney's reference to the rule of law is telling. The rule of law and the justice system are the flip side to our democracy. The law ensures that the democratic will of the people is adhered to. This is why the case of Joseph Rafferty's murder must be discussed in this House. JosephRafferty was originally from the south inner city and it is claimed that in the months leading up to his murder, he had become embroiled in a dispute with a family from that area. Mr. Rafferty was allegedly told a number of times by members of the family with which he had clashed that he would be "got" by the IRA. This took place in the south inner city, on the other side of Trinity College and that institution is all that stands between this House and where this terror unfolded. Our institutions, such as this House, are all that stand between us and brutal thuggery, the law of the jungle, criminality and terror. Joseph Rafferty's murder and the necessity for the campaign led by his family are a stark reminder of how everything we hold dear is threatened by criminal elements, thugs and the IRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Sinn Féin asks people to join the organisation to do the following: to take an active part in changing Irish society; to work to build an Ireland of equals; and to campaign for justice on issues locally and nationally. Let us look at each of these in the context of the McCartney and Rafferty slayings. Remember that Sinn Féin bargained with and depend on its association with the illegal Provisional IRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">First, it claims to be taking an active part in changing Irish society. Is that changing Irish society for its good or to its detriment? IRA-Sinn Féin is undoubtedly active in changing our society. Robbery, money laundering and asset creation are used to create a state within a state with no loyalty to our State or to our society. The IRA is not going out of business. We should remember it is going into business. The IRA's army council and its political membership oversee the transformation from a heavily armed private army into a lightly armed criminal enforcement group. I urge no one to take any part in Sinn Féin's activities to change Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Second, it claims to be working to build an Ireland of equals. How equal will Ireland be when one group engages in beatings, extortion, robbery, exiling, smuggling, running protection rackets and money laundering? What if all this is done on behalf of those who engage in politics? Do Members see this as an Ireland of equals? I do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Third, it claims to be campaigning for justice on issues locally and nationally. I am almost lost for words. Spare a special thought for the Raffertys. Deputy Ó Caoláin has denied that any member of Sinn Féin or the IRA was involved in the murder of Mr. Rafferty. As I have stated, the Garda has confirmed to the national media that the suspect in the Rafferty murder was in the IRA. Members may choose the bona fides they prefer as they will. If, as alleged, Sinn Féin representatives refused to intervene to save Mr. Rafferty's life, what faith can we have that they will campaign for local justice for Mr. Rafferty and his family? Whose justice are we talking about? Is it our democratic system of justice or is it IRA justice? The Minister stated that our justice system does not wear a balaclava as a badge of honour. Senator Ryan stated that there is only one Óglaigh na hÉireann. I am happy that I was a member of Óglaigh na hÉireann for 21 years and that I was involved in peace processes throughout the world. However, I never wore a balaclava; I wore a blue beret and I was happy to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The Rafferty family claims that a Sinn Féin councillor was informed about the threats against Joseph Rafferty a number of times in the past year and earlier this year. Was the murder of Joseph Rafferty part of Sinn Féin's vision of local justice? Who would join their campaign for local justice if that is the case? The Progressive Democrats truly support campaigns for justice and we support the Rafferty family in its pursuit of justice. The family believes that Sinn Féin representatives on Dublin City Council are in a position to put pressure on the chief suspect to make a statement to the Garda. If Sinn Féin wants to campaign for justice, it should ensure it does everything possible to help the Raffertys in their cause. The criminal activity linked to republicans, such as the Northern Bank raid and the McCartney and Rafferty murders, will not be air-brushed out of the picture. The Government has committed itself to raising the issue again when next it meets Mr. Adams. The Garda intelligence and security investigations are on-going. I welcome this action and all action to ensure that our justice system is protected. That is at the heart of the Rafferty campaign. They are brave enough to take on those elements in society, those in dark corners and those so-called public representatives whose ideology is repugnant to what we know and whose actions threaten what we hold dear.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Never before have I agreed with Mr. Adams, but at the ploughing championships yesterday in Cork, he said that this murder was carried out by thugs. He is right and I agree with him, but he left out one word before that. They were IRA thugs.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_329">Along with my colleague, Senator Ryan, I fully support this motion. I sympathise with the family on their loss and I commend them on their bravery in pursuing this case. There are not many people in our society who are prepared to put their head above the parapet in this way, but the Rafferty and McCartney families have. When they do that, we all benefit and democracy benefits. Deputy Quinn and Councillor Kevin Humphries of the Labour Party have met with the Rafferty family and have discussed the case with them. They have supported calls that Sinn Féin does whatever it can to make sure the killer is brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Sinn Féin Councillors Daithí Doolin and Christy Burke stated that if it transpired that the killer was a member of Sinn Féin, they would resign their seats. When asked about the IRA, Councillor Burke was quoted as saying that he would not dare ask if a person was a member of the IRA. Why not? When Sinn Féin receives bad publicity, then its representatives claim they have nothing to do with the IRA. However, Gerry Adams was doing everything he could today to maximise the IRA initiative on decommissioning. Sinn Féin members cannot act like pop stars and refuse to answer the hard questions. If they are really embracing democracy, then they must accept accountability, especially accountability to the law. For all the fanfare, Sinn Féin members are showing that they are not prepared to do that. They should not be let away with it in politics.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_331">I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to say a few words on this dreadful event. It is a sad reflection on our society that we are here discussing such a gruesome, cowardly act. However, it is also very necessary that we do so. The apparent intimidation that is going on in certain parts of the south inner city, as reported, is frightening. If we think of the plight of the McCartney family and move the events to Ringsend, we then have it in context. We would be derelict in our duty if we ignored this issue, the plight of the Rafferty family and the intimidation to which they had been subjected.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The Rafferty family saw their loved one gunned down in cold blood on 12 April. He died after being shot twice in the upper body as he left his home in Ongar Park, Blanchardstown. Since then, the family has been fighting hard to bring about some justice. By all accounts, we are talking about a decent man who went about his business making a life for himself and his family, including his young child. He did not rely on anyone for handouts and he went out and made it happen for himself. When he was not working in his job as a courier, he was doing other work to make life even better for himself and his family. That his life was worth so little is disgusting. That the person who murdered him is still walking among us is a disgrace and if the person is receiving the protection of any organisation, democratic or otherwise, then that person should be exposed for what he is.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Any article that I have read on this murder draws comparisons with the killing of Robert McCartney. Many observers much closer to the situation have suggested such similarities. I am not in a position to offer a view one way or the other as to who committed this dreadful murder, but I have spoken to people who are much closer to the situation and it is hard not to conclude that there is a familiar hand spreading itself across the chain of events. One of my own colleagues on Dublin City Council, Councillor Gary Keegan, has been deeply involved in this issue and has a strong view as to how this dreadful deed was committed. Joseph Rafferty's family are obviously heartbroken and there will never be a day when they do not remember him. They deserve justice and they deserve our assistance in acquiring that justice. The family is now embarking on a nationwide campaign in order to bring about that justice and I wish them well.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Comments have been made that the gunman is known to all and sundry. It is stated that he was recently seen at a Sinn Féin rally in the city. That is also denied by the Sinn Féin councillors on Dublin City Council and by the Sinn Féin representatives in the Dáil. Councillor Keegan stated in Dublin City Hall that Joseph Rafferty was executed over a meaningless petty grudge which was fuelled by a little thug and his mother who resides with the alleged killer. It is a sad reflection on our society that a thug like the man in question has the power to cause another man's life to be snuffed out in such a callous and cold manner. It says something about us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I have been informed that the Garda is doing a good job in this case. I have been led to believe that the Rafferty family is quite satisfied with the progress being made by the force. I encourage all those with any knowledge, no matter how small, of this issue to contact the Garda Síochána. The police should assure those who come forward that they will receive all possible protection from the force. There is no doubt that in circumstances of this nature, a fear of reprisal can influence the actions of the most upstanding members of society. We do not need any proof of what these people are capable of doing. Anyone who comes forward to give information to the Garda should be given some form of assurance, in so far as it is possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">As a society, we have to make it clear that there is no hiding place for these thugs on this island. If we are to think of our society as civilised, we must ensure these individuals cannot avail of any hiding place. I am sure the Rafferty family has taken great comfort and guidance from the endeavours of the McCartney family. We all know what the McCartneys achieved in similar circumstances. I know the Rafferty family will not give up until the killers of Joseph Rafferty receive their just punishment. I wish the Rafferty family well in their endeavours and I offer them the support of this side of the House, for what it is worth. I encourage all decent minded people to help the Garda Síochána in whatever way they can.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">If it is the case that members of Sinn Féin know something about the death of Joseph Rafferty, I appeal to them to come forward to give such information to the Garda. That party should not make the mistakes it made in the McCartney case, when it denied that Sinn Féin members were involved and then offered to shoot the killers of Robert McCartney. Those associated with Sinn Féin should give the Garda whatever information they have, to help the Rafferty family to achieve closure. I know that the Taoiseach, who met members of the Rafferty family yesterday, will do everything in his power in this case, just as he and the Minister, Deputy McDowell, have done in the past. I wish the Rafferty family well in their endeavours.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_339">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. I wish to make a short contribution to this important debate, which offers Senators an opportunity to acknowledge again the importance of justice as a cornerstone of our democracy. It is important that the pillars of justice are seen to uphold what the Members of the Oireachtas stand for. We should take this opportunity to remind ourselves in a significant way of the value of life. We have almost become inured and anaesthetised to the discovery of bodies following murders in various parts of this island. It is important that this debate should remind us again of the importance of a person's life. My feelings on the murder of Joseph Rafferty are similar to my feelings on the killings of Brian Fitzgerald, a totally innocent person who was murdered outside a nightclub in Limerick for standing up for what was right, and Robert McCartney. The actions which were perpetrated against the people I have mentioned, who were taken out, represent one of the many evil sides of terrorism. I do not doubt that regardless of the provenance of the person who carried out the terrible murder of Joseph Rafferty — regardless of whether the person is a member of the IRA — the events in question are symptomatic of our society's free access to killing and easy approach to life.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Senators should stand and salute the members of the family of Joseph Rafferty, some of whom are present in the House this evening. As previous speakers have said, Mr. Rafferty's relatives have shown they are prepared to take a courageous and public stand. They have proved willing to take their case to the greatest court of all — to the people. It is hugely important for them to recognise that although justice and politics are completely intertwined, they are completely separate at the same time. It is quite a difficult concept. As Members of the Oireachtas, we make the law and ensure that it is implemented, but we do not dare to involve ourselves in how it is implemented. It is a tricky set of circumstances, which relates to other matters such as the case of the Rossport five. We need to consider the extent to which we, as elected representatives, can get involved in legal matters. In this instance, we are on the cusp of a movement. This is the beginning of the long road to justice for Joseph Rafferty. People had to take the same road to prove the innocence of the Birmingham six or the Guildford four. The obverse is the case in this instance — the Rafferty family are trying to bring to justice a person who is clearly guilty of a terrible murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">It is clear that this is a difficult time for the Rafferty family. While no family wants to be faced with a challenge of this nature, it is impossible for any family to walk away from it. For that reason, the members of the Rafferty family deserve our full support, wherever it can be provided. Every public representative, including those who represent Sinn Féin, has a responsibility to ensure that no stone is left unturned to help them. If members of Sinn Féin have some information about the death of Joseph Rafferty, they have a bounden duty to ensure that such details are brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities. Some people in Irish life have a certain attitude to consultation with the Garda — they question whether co-operating with the force is the right thing to do. There can be no doubt that society regulates itself by means of its law and its police force. As I said at the outset, the justice system, as a means of social regulation, is a cornerstone of what we do. If we are to ensure that our justice system is upheld, we have a responsibility to give our fullest support to the motion before the House. We need to urge all those mentioned in the motion to take the appropriate action to ensure that the necessary information is brought to the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The importance of this debate is that it is sending a clear statement to all and sundry — I refer to the people at large, Sinn Féin, the IRA, whoever is listening and whoever wants to listen — that there should be no hiding place for people in our society who act like whoever killed Joseph Rafferty. This kind of killing diminishes everyone in society. The manner in which we deal with such crimes is a reflection on how we order and regulate our society. For that reason, we have to ensure that justice is done. Those who are protecting and hiding the suspect in the case of Joseph Rafferty in such an unacceptable manner should be answerable to society at large. Justice needs to be done, and to be seen to be done, quickly. I hope the Rafferty family will take some sustenance from the support of people on all sides of the political stage. I hope we can be of some help to the family during its challenge to find justice for Joseph Rafferty.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_343">As the Leader of the House, I wish to add my voice to this debate. I thank the Fine Gael Party, which deserves credit for using its Private Members' time to initiate a debate on this issue. I give credit to the Minister, Deputy Michael McDowell, and his colleagues on the Government side who produced an amended motion that took the views of all parties into account. The leaders of the parties in this House met after the Order of Business to decide, with the help of a very careful official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on an amended wording that is acceptable to all sides. The thrust of the amended version is the same as the thrust of the original motion, although some of the language has been altered.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Several messages have been sent by those who have spoken on the motion to date. The message that politicians can agree on certain matters when the cause is just is a powerful one. Media commentators would have one believe that politicians spend their time shouting and roaring without doing anything positive. They suggest that we do not get anywhere with our ideas. If one listened to what was said on the radio this morning, one would have believed that nothing of any use would be done in the Seanad or the Dáil today. This House had an interesting debate this afternoon and the matter currently under discussion is highly relevant to the developments of last Monday and the ongoing issue of Ireland as a whole. The powerful message being sent out by Members on all sides of the House — I refer to Members from all parties and Independent Members — is that we strongly support the Rafferty family's campaign to find their brother's murderer or murderers, and to bring him or them to justice so that justice can be seen to be done. The Rafferty family is on a hard road and they know this; their faces show it this evening. This matter has been going on for some months. At the same time there are people in the community from which they come who know what happened. There is no doubt there are people who know the exact circumstances of who did it and when it was done. There will always be people who will talk and tell the tale. The combined message going out from here tonight is that the perpetrators of that heinous act should be brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I went to Belfast to meet the McCartneys in their home at the time of the last election and I was struck by their tenacity and determination. I am aware the Rafferty family has spoken to them and exchanged views on strategies and how they might follow the path they have forged. I applaud that measure and consider it is the best way to go about it. The Rafferty views are forthright and they are getting media attention. They are standing four square behind the memory of their brother and intend to have his killer or killers brought to justice. I wish them good luck in their efforts. All of us in this august Chamber stand with the Rafferty family.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_106">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_346">I welcome the Rafferty family to the Chamber and applaud their courage and conviction in seeking justice for the death of Joseph Rafferty. Many of us in this Chamber come from a very proud republican past, from the real Sinn Féin. We in Fine Gael, as in Fine Fáil, look forward to celebrating the real 100 years of Sinn Féin. My grandfather James Feely was a Sinn Féin councillor who was imprisoned during the War of Independence. He joined the Army after the ceasefire and retired as a member of the Garda. I believe he did the State some service. At that time people made a transition from freedom fighters to people who uphold the law. What Sinn Féin must do now is uphold the law in this country. I applaud the major announcement weheard this week which is a step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">By all accounts, Joseph Rafferty was a quiet, hard working man who had no involvement in crime. He was a product of the Celtic tiger. I took a walk around this city tonight and was proud to see that at last there is real employment and opportunities. There is a now a chance for people to have housing, the benefit of going on holidays and having children who will have a future. That is what Joseph Rafferty stood for and what the Raffertys stand for. They want a country of which we can be proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">I have seen subtle intimidation in my own town in the early 1980s when we had the H-Block marches. People came around in cars and told shops to close which made them very afraid. That intimidation is nothing to what the Rafferty family has gone through. That is real intimidation and we must ensure it will stop. Sinn Féin and others must report crimes to the Garda. I have no reason to disbelieve the reports I have heard tonight that these people are involved in the Republican movement, Sinn Féin or the IRA. It is incumbent on Sinn Féin to ensure that its members co-operate with the Garda to ensure that the perpetrators of this heinous crime are brought to justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Democracy is a fragile flower that needs the support of all the people to ensure that we have not just a united Ireland but a better Ireland. The Robert McCartney crime remains unsolved in Belfast. The SDLP does not have guns and was overlooked by both the British and Irish Governments. Now that the guns are out of politics it is time for all these parties to come into the fold. I call on the Minister to ensure that the full resources of the law will be brought to bear to ensure these perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_350">I welcome the motion and offer my support and solidarity to the Rafferty family. The case has many similarities with the Robert McCartney case. In both instances we have family members simply not prepared to suffer in silence in the face of intimidation and harassment. Over the years we have had groups rightly seeking justice for victims of State violence in the North. It is equally right that the same rigorous criteria of justice are applied where people are the victims of paramilitary organisations. Although I will not address it this evening I have no doubt that precisely the same problem exists in acute form in loyalist communities. It behoves us to give support to people who are not going to put up any longer with that type of intimidation. As we know, the homes of the McCartney sisters are attacked at least in a minor way practically every night, which is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">This is a week in which very important and momentous advances have been made but that is not the end of the matter. There is a culture where people feel some kind of mystical authority to take the law into their own hands and to harm and injure other people. We should not have to tolerate this in any part of this country. I accept the point that these were not operations authorised by the IRA army council or any unit. They happen because individuals associated with that organisation got involved. What has happened both before and after is not a pretty sight. The peace process will not be complete until we get rid of that culture North and South. Let us be frank, this has existed in one form or another, including in parts of this jurisdiction, for up to 80 years. It was fading away until the Troubles arose and gave it a new impetus, particularly in certain parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">An attitudinal change needs to be made. There are people who get involved in these activities who the Garda Síochána discovers have memorabilia associated with the killers of Detective Garda McCabe and who seem to take some pride or glory in accidents like that. We in the House, and all decent people, regard that sort of thing as reprehensible and find it very difficult to get into the minds of people who believe what happened in Adare in 1996 was a glorious act.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The mindset and culture must be changed. People within the movements in question who want to make progress probably want to achieve such change but it is a very difficult task. They are dealing with an ingrained culture. The political organisations should not be surprised if there is no enthusiasm on any side of either House of the Oireachtas for getting into full-scale political partnership with them any time soon until such matters are dealt with. I appeal again to the leadership of Sinn Féin to make more effective efforts to have these matters sorted out and to be as rigorous in demanding justice as they are in the cases of Pat Finucane or others who have been killed to some degree in collusion with the state. There cannot be double standards. Although the members of the Rafferty family have suffered terribly in a way people should not have to suffer, they, in their reaction and the courage they have shown, are doing a real public service to this society, just as members of the McCartney family are doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">It is time for Sinn Féin to get real. We listen to its representatives every day talking about the great work the party is doing and stating it represents the marginalised in society. I always feel that all the political parties represent the marginalised. Nobody has a monopoly on the marginalised. We deal with the marginalised regularly in our daily work in our constituency offices. Nobody can claim to have a monopoly of representation over the marginalised sector of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">If one considers the reality on the ground, including the killings of Robert McCartney and Joseph Rafferty, and even that of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, one will note that Sinn Féin has been found wanting on every occasion. I thank God we have strong women in this country. In this regard I commend the widow of Jerry McCabe, Ann McCabe, who was fantastic in very difficult personal circumstances and who stood up to Sinn Féin at local and national levels. I compliment the McCartney sisters, who played a stormer, took on Sinn Féin and highlighted the case of their brother although they were being intimidated, as they are even to this day. This intimidation is truly shocking. I compliment the Rafferty family who are following their example. It is shocking in this day and age that a certain element in the Sinn Féin-IRA organisation has not moved on or realised it is not acceptable in a civilised society to mete out what it considers to be justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">There is talk about a united Ireland but I believe we should talk about it in terms of people rather than just in terms of geography. I welcomed the physical act of decommissioning this week but we must now move on and decommission the mindset of which previous speakers have spoken. Shakespeare warned us to beware of smiling faces. This applies in particular to many members of the Sinn Féin leadership. The come across very well and appear very suave on television and radio, yet when it comes to asking the hard questions and making tough decisions within their own ranks, they are found wanting. I urge them to accept the responsibility they have been given and out the people within their organisation who should be outed in respect of the killings of both Robert McCartney and Joseph Rafferty.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I was very upset during the summer when I heard the Taoiseach speak about Sinn Féin being given speaking rights, in the Seanad in particular. That was not agreed in the House. The Taoiseach should not be engaging in side deals with Sinn Féin and every issue should be in the open and debatable. We are living in a democracy and actions such as that of the Taoiseach are unhelpful. We noted the furore last year over the possible release of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. I am thankful the Opposition opposed it and that the Government did a U-turn in this regard. The House has stood united tonight against thuggery and violence and this is the way forward. The days of secret deals and meetings are over.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I sympathise again with the Rafferty family and urge members of Sinn Féin and the IRA who have relevant information to come forward immediately. There are many decent people in Sinn Féin, particularly those under the age of 30 who remember the party in times of peace. However, we should not forget the atrocities that were committed and must never return to circumstances in which they are committed again.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">I sat here for the duration of the debate and have really been touched by what people have had to say. I realised how brave we are to come into the House and say what has been said today. The members of the Rafferty family have said they are being intimidated. Every right-thinking person must believe them when they say that. In a democracy, such intimidation is indefensible and must be stopped. It is the duty of all citizens of this democratic Republic to renounced it an co-operate with the authorities in every way possible to stamp it out and defeat it.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">Having listened to the debate, I noted that neither I nor anybody else present can say who carried out this terrible crime, the murder of Joseph Rafferty. It is only for the courts to determine. However, we as responsible citizens of this Republic should ensure that all co-operation is given to the Garda to help it bring the perpetrators of Joseph's murder to justice. The Minister referred in his speech to those who may remain silent out of a sense of loyalty, whether political or personal. If they remain silent for that reason, they have a false sense of loyalty. How right the Minister is. He also stated there are others who are simply too frightened to cross those involved. I can believe that also. It is therefore up to people such as us, elected Members of the Oireachtas, who are normal citizens going about our everyday lives, just like the members of the Rafferty family, to speak out. If we do not come into this House and speak out about Joseph Rafferty's murder, we are doing politics a great disservice.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">In <i>The Irish Times</i> today I was interested to read a quotation from Councillor Garry Keegan which really caught me: “It’s not a campaign to get at Sinn Féin or the IRA. It’s a fight for justice and we’re calling on Sinn Féin-IRA to hand over the people responsible.” He is correct in that this is not a matter of political parties. This is an agreed cross-party motion being debated today and it is not a case of political parties having a go at Sinn Féin-IRA, as they would like us and the rest of the country to believe. We are citizens who happen to be elected Members of the Oireachtas and local government who are looking for justice for the Rafferty family, whose case is very similar to the case of the McCartney family.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Senator Jim Walsh stated in his contribution that members of Sinn Féin-IRA believed rightly or wrongly they have had a cause to fight for over the past 25 years, a fight to get the British army out of Northern Ireland. There are people in Sinn Féin-IRA, who have been described in this House as thugs and worse, who have no cause and never had a cause for which to fight. They are the people who callously took Joseph Rafferty's life. If there are fair-minded people in Sinn Féin-IRA, I ask them not to hide those responsible, the thugs who go under its banner, because they are not fighting for any cause and they have no regard for life. What was done to the Rafferty's lovely brother would not be done to an animal.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Nobody believes this was a sanctioned murder, as if it would make any difference whether a murder was sanctioned. I question how anyone can take life, whether that action is sanctioned or otherwise. This murder was carried out by persons with no regard for life. It is chilling for us all to think that those people are walking around today. I wish the family all the best in their campaign and assure them of the continued support of all Members of the House.</p>

I also compliment the leaders of all the groupings in this House, the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny and Deputy Rabbitte and all those who met and supported this family in their hour of need. This was an appalling and brutal murder of an innocent man. I hope and trust the Garda Síochána will be empowered and enabled to bring a successful prosecution of the murderer.

          <p eId="para_373">I do not often disagree with Senator Feeney but I do not think we need any courage in this House. The people who show the real courage are the Rafferty and McCartney families. It is easy enough for us to talk about the rule of law but the really courageous people are those who vindicate the rule of law. It is easy to talk about rights but the courageous people are those who assert their rights in a hostile environment and for which I applaud them. We must support those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">A remark attributed to Edmund Burke states that all it needed for evil to succeed was for good people to do nothing. We must ensure a culture in which good people can do something. I am not familiar with the details of Mr. Rafferty's murder and I am anxious not to prejudice any trial. I remind the House that a suspect is a suspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I was deeply impressed by Senator Mansergh's remarks and anything I say may be taken as a rider to them. I am familiar with the Markets area of Belfast and I am acquainted with the McCartneys and with their case. The frightening aspect is not the murder alone which was vicious and bad enough but the fact that a whole community could be cowed into silence. That culture of <i>omerta</i> needs to be changed and this is a challenge to all those who aspire to political leadership or to political office.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">It is not sufficient to advise people to go to the police. People were told to go to the police regarding the McCartney case but what did 80 witnesses see, everyone of whom was in the toilet when the incident occurred? It must have been the biggest toilet in western Europe. We are asking for rather more than compliance with the letter of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Like most people in this House and in this country, I rejoiced at the act of decommissioning this week and seeing the republican movement turning firmly towards politics and giving up the armalite for the ballot box. However, there must also be decommissioning of a culture. There is a baggage of criminality and of fellow travellers and these will be millstones around some people's necks. I appeal to the people in Sinn Féin to acknowledge this fact, to disown those people and to get rid of them. In the case of the McCartney killing everybody in that community knows who did it. They know why the person is being shielded by the republican movement and by Sinn Féin. If they are to have any pretension to engagement in formal politics, they will need to end that culture for their own good and for the good of all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I acknowledge that loyalist violence exists in the North as does sectarianism but discussion of loyalist violence takes the focus away from the present debate as does discussion of 800 years of British rule. Our own laws have been in existence for more than 80 years in this part of the island and this is sufficient legitimacy. The Garda Síochána has been the only police force for more than 80 years. Whatever reservations people might have about the PSNI, they can have none about the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I counsel against a system of restorative justice schemes. These can be excellent in themselves and can be of help to the victim but they must be closely linked with the Garda otherwise they become a vehicle for vigilantism or summary justice. I applaud the Rafferty family. I was deeply moved by the debate and by the unanimity shown. I am grateful to the Fine Gael Party for providing this opportunity to the House to show it is solidly behind citizens who have the courage to claim their rights and ask that they be vindicated.</p>

          <p eId="para_380">I welcome the Rafferty family to the House. I have not been through what the Rafferty family have endured and one must have suffered in order to have complete empathy with the suffering of another. I sincerely hope there will be a fruitful solution to this tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">As an activist in the peace process in the North since 1993, I have travelled to the North frequently. I spoke out in this Chamber against collusion in the case of the murders of Pat Finucane and Rosemary Nelson. It is known there was collusion between the forces of the state in the North in these murders. Sinn Féin must acknowledge the rights of the Rafferty family are the same as those of the Finucane family. If Sinn Féin knows the identity of the criminal thug who committed the violent act against Joseph Rafferty and in order for it to progress in a constitutional and political manner, it must be strong in fighting and getting rid of thugs and gangsters. I wish the Rafferty family success in their campaign and I thank them for attending the House today.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_382">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this agreed motion. Citizens of this democratic Republic are all subject to the rule of law and bound by the rules of law and order. We elect our representatives in this democracy to legislate and produce laws to protect ourselves and our families and to apply those laws equally to everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The political implications of what happened to Joseph Rafferty are one issue, but far more important and horrifying are the human implications of what happened to him. The Rafferty family and their relations and friends are traumatised by what they have gone through in recent months. That is on what we should focus. As public representatives, many Members of this and the other House have worked with Sinn Féin representatives and activists for a number of years. We know what they are capable of and, more importantly, we know what they are not capable of. What do we as public representatives say to a mother who calls to see one of us in an advice centre concerning her 16 year old son who was dragged into the back of a van, beaten to a pulp, thrown out of the van in the carpark of a shopping centre and told later it was a case of mistaken identity? What do the Rafferty family say to Joseph's child about how their father died? These are the human implications of what we are talking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">What the Rafferty family and Councillor Gary Keegan are seeking is justice for Joseph, his child and wider family. As representatives, we must do everything possible to maintain pressure on the elements within Sinn Féin who have information about this case and to give that information to the gardaí. If the Sinn Féin leadership want to be seen as leaders, they should lead. Our leaders, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, spoke to the family and they were proactive in dealing with this case. If the Sinn Féin leadership wants to be seen as what they are portraying themselves to be, they must take action. There is an onus on us to support the Rafferty family and the view has come across that we all do so. We support their efforts and cause. As citizens, we are all subject to the rule of law and order. The fact that so many Senators committed themselves to dealing with this issue is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">I commend the family and Councillor Keegan and assure them that those of us on this side of the House will support them in all their efforts.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_386">I thank my colleagues on both sides of the House who contributed to this debate. Some 21 colleagues, representing more than one third of the Members of the Seanad, contributed. It was an important statement that there would be unanimity in the position we would take on this motion. I was struck by many comments made.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">If this case related to another party and if a member of or activist in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Party was a prime suspect in a brutal murder case in Dublin, do Members not think that each of our parties would immediately disown that person? There probably would be a disciplinary executive meeting to establish the facts of the case. There would be automatic transfer of information to the gardaí, the prosecuting authorities. That is what would happen if the same situation existed in any of our parties, but that is what is not happening with the Sinn Féin leadership in terms of this brutal murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Senator Kett made one of the most telling contributions when he said it is crucial that whoever comes forward with the evidence required to bring a prosecution in this case, and that person or group of individuals will need considerable courage, that person or group will need protection. The Senator was right about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">We should not forget the words of the High Court judge in the McCabe case; he said it was the worst form of intimidation of witnesses he had ever seen before a court. The reason the McCabe murder was turned into a manslaughter charge was because of the difficulty in getting witnesses to the court to give open evidence in that court. Despite all the smiles, sweet words and lovely press and photo opportunities, these people are capable of anything. What Sinn Féin-IRA want to do now is to wipe all this clean. It wants this campaign and the Rafferty family to go away. It hopes that this issue will not emerge next week, that no one else will raise it at another forum, that it will not be raised internationally and that it will get over this month or two, move on and forget about all the bad publicity associated with the Rafferty murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I want to tell its members that this case and the family will not go away. It is right that every Senator who spoke here tonight mentioned that there is a resolve here among all the democratic parties, the institutions of this State to ensure that justice is done for Joseph Rafferty and for his family. That is why it is crucial that this case does not go away and remains at the top of people's political agenda until such a time as a successful prosecution is brought to bear.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I was struck by the argument made by the Minister, namely, the notion that in this day and age a law abiding family must take a case of intimidation to a local politician in order that such a politician can adjudicate with some shadowy group in the background is anathema to the notion of a free society. The fact that people did not have the confidence to go to the gardaí in the first instance because of the intimidation they were suffering is another appalling indictment of the way in which some people in some working class communities feel that they act above and beyond the law and with impunity. As long as we accept that is going on, it is a total negation of our democratic responsibilities. That is why it is crucial that this campaign continues until we find a successful conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Senator O'Toole summed it up well when he said that at the end of the day, this is about one life, a young man who came into contact with the republican movement and a young man who is now dead. That is on what we must focus as we go forward; the vindication of that man's right to life and of his family's right to have justice. One of the worst tragedies a parent or parents can face, as in the case of Joseph Rafferty, is to bury one's son or daughter. It is something of which a mother never thinks when she gives birth or of which we never think when we have the joy of having children. We must do everything we can to ensure, in the words of Senator O'Toole, that the importance of that young man's life is not forgotten and that those who were responsible for this crime are brought before the courts.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_395">I warmly welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, to the House. No one is in a better position to discuss Muckross House than the Minister of State given her knowledge of that lovely place. I remember her visits to the House in her former capacity as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands when she did a wonderful job assisting us, particularly on the occasion of the opening of our garden restaurant. Will she do me a favour and thank the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, for his visit to Killarney in July, in particular for signing the new partnership agreement with the trustees of Muckross House and for the launch of the management plan for Killarney National Park? I also thank the Minister, Deputy Roche, for signing the new partnership agreement with the trustees of Muckross House and launching the new management plan for Killarney National Park.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I am pleased that it is intended to retain and preserve the integrity and character of Killarney House, both internally and externally, and to provide for visitor access to certain parts of it as appropriate, in particular the three main furnished reception rooms. To this end, most of the contents of the house have been acquired by the State, including some important furniture and art that dates back to the Earls of Kenmare. I thank the Minister for meeting Killarney Town Council and giving assurances to it, the people of Killarney and the wider public on Killarney House in the course of his visit in July.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I would like to hear an update on the situation today. I had concerns about the house given the unfortunate state into which it had fallen and the cost of the necessary restoration works, particularly when it has been in State ownership for so many years and because it is vital to put a halt to the decay. I look forward to hearing how the house will be preserved and the timeframe involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The Minister knows how important the house and grounds are to Killarney, being such a prominent feature located in the town itself. It has the potential to make a magnificent contribution to the tourism infrastructure of Killarney. The previous management plan, that was sadly not implemented, contained wonderful proposals for the gardens that were specified in detailed accompanying maps. I hope and trust the gardens and grounds will not be neglected either and I look forward to hearing about this aspect. It is a pity that the expertise of the great botanist, Mr. Cormac Foley, was not availed of over the years. He is now with the Office of Public Works but I hope his expertise has not been lost because those were wonderful plans. I have not seen all of the management plan launched by the Minister in July but I would like to know if those plans have been carried forward.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SiledeValera" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_124">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</from>
          <p eId="para_399">I thank Senator Coghlan for giving me the opportunity to address this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. The Minister enjoyed his visit to Muckross House and Killarney in July and I am aware of Senator Coghlan's interest in and commitment to Muckross House and the heritage of County Kerry. I am also interested in Muckross House and I am pleased to see my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Roche, has continued that interest. I have enjoyed many visits to Kerry, not least to Muckross House, which were very pleasant. All of us who are interested in heritage know this house is dear to the heart of people of Kerry and it is also a national treasure.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Killarney House and the greater part of the accompanying estate was sold to the State in 1978 by the then owner, John McShain, for a sum well below market value, on the assurance that the house and estate would be incorporated into Killarney National Park. Mr. and Mrs. McShain reserved the house and surrounding 52 acres for their use for their lifetimes. Mr. McShain died in 1989 and Mrs. McShain lived in the house until her death in 1998, when use of the House reverted to the State. The house is currently the responsibility of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department, which manages Killarney National Park.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">There have already been a number of recent works to Killarney House. The golden gates and railings of the house have been restored, a security system has been installed and heating pipes and radiators have been upgraded. The lawns and garden at Killarney House are regularly maintained and small maintenance jobs are carried out on the house. The grounds of Killarney House are already a significant attraction in the town of Killarney.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Following recent consultations by the Department with the Office of Public Works, essential works are now under way to avoid any deterioration to the fabric of the building. These works are being funded by the Department and include the removal of plaster on the walls to prevent dampness, the provision of dehumidifiers to all the main rooms on the ground floor and other incidental but highly important trench and draining works.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The future use of Killarney House and gardens must be considered within the context of the management plan for Killarney National Park, which was launched at Killarney House in July of this year and which has been endorsed by the Killarney National Park liaison committee. On that occasion it became clear that there is indeed great potential for the refurbishment of the house into a valuable facility for both the national park and the people of Killarney.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Under the Killarney National Park management plan, it is intended to retain and preserve the integrity and character of Killarney House both internally and externally and to provide for visitor access to certain parts as appropriate, particularly the three main furnished reception rooms. To this end, most of the contents of the house have been acquired by the Department, including some important pieces of furniture and art dating back to the Earls of Kenmare.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Detailed specialist surveys commissioned by the Office of Public Works have made it clear that significant infrastructural works are required. In particular, adequate plumbing, heating and electrical systems must be installed before the house can be opened to the public. The total cost of these works will be considerable. Planning permission for a change of use will also be necessary. A decision on the nature and extent of works to Killarney House will, therefore, depend on the future availability of capital funding, having regard to other demands on the Department's capital budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The Minister's ambition is to restore the ground floor of this house to its original state of splendour as a further visitor attraction for the town of Killarney and as a reference point for visitors to Killarney National Park. However, it is important to canvass the views of key stakeholders before deciding on the best way forward and, to this end, the Department has recently invited the trustees of Muckross House to come forward with their ideas for the house. The Department is also, of course, seeking the views of the Killarney National Park liaison committee itself on this matter. The Minister welcomed the opportunity to hear the views of Killarney town councillors when he met them in Killarney House in July.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The Minister is committed to ensuring that Killarney House fulfils its potential and has asked that the Department work closely with the Office of Public Works in deciding upon a phased work programme for the house, having regard to the availability of resources and the views of key stakeholders.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_409">I wish to raise on the Adjournment the need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to ensure funding to complete the entire project at Longford-Westmeath Regional Hospital in Mullingar is provided and to set a timeframe for completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I am proud to say I live in Mullingar and the hospital there is a source of pride for everyone in Westmeath and Longford. In a recent report in the national news, Mullingar was deemed to be one of the best performing hospitals in the country. I appreciate that in the past five years, no fewer than seven consultants have been appointed to Mullingar general hospital, including a consultant in radiology, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology, a consultant paediatrician, a consultant anaesthetist, a consultant physician with an interest in cardiology, a consultant general surgeon and, most recently, a consultant in accident and emergency.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Much has been said about this important project. Despite the difficult circumstances pertaining at Mullingar general hospital, its nurses, doctors and ancillary staff give a fine service. Pious plaudits, however, are not enough and more needs to be done. The development control plan at the midland regional hospital at Mullingar, phase 2B, was completed at the end of 2003 and approval was received from the Department of Health and Children in September 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Members will be aware that several years ago when phase 2A was built and 2B was shelled out, it would then become the turn of other projects in the midland region to receive capital funding. I put in a proposal on this to the then Midland Health Board which subsequently changed this. As a result, the design team was appointed and the project which now stands for consideration in the Department of Health and Children is approximately four times that of the original project. It includes a medical assessment unit, which was recently opened. I extend warm congratulations to the consultant with the unit, Dr. Seán Murphy, and his staff for the excellent service they provide. The rest of the project includes an operating theatre, an intensive care unit, coronary care unit, a rehabilitation unit, an acute psychiatric unit, in which I have particular interest having worked in that area, a child and adolescent psychiatry unit, a pathology department, an occupational therapy department, on-call accommodation, central staff changing facilities, office accommodation, a catering department, a maintenance workshop and a central equipment store. Funding of approximately €57 million has been allocated by the Department and it has accepted the development control plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">However, matters have not progressed as fast as I would have liked. There is a degree of impatience pertaining to this project among people in counties Longford and Westmeath. I accept the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen's statement on the matter as bona fide. Nevertheless, for the benefit of those who still harbour lingering doubts, it is imperative a clear statement on the project's status is made. The project has been in place for some years. The plan is to complete the shelled-out part of the hospital at the end of next year. Patients will then be moved from the existing hospital so as to proceed with the remaining part of the project. When it is completed it will mean Mullingar general hospital will be a finer hospital with its bed complement increasing from 203 to 311. I want a clear statement on how this project is progressing.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_414">I know this is a matter Senator Glynn has taken a keen interest in and been supportive of over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The original general hospital in Mullingar was built in the 1930s and subsequently extended through a phase 1 development which was officially opened in 1990. Planning then commenced on phase 2 of the development of the hospital, which was subsequently divided into two phases, phase 2A and 2B. Phase 2A opened in 1997-98 and included a radiology department, an outpatients department, an accident and emergency department and a main concourse and reception area. It was agreed at the time that part of the construction contract for phase 2A would include the shelling-out of four floors designed to house ward accommodation scheduled for provision as part of phase 2B. This was considered prudent both from a long-term value for money perspective and to minimise disruption to existing functioning accommodation during phase 2B construction.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Capital funds to progress phase 2B are provided for by the Health Service Executive in its health capital investment framework 2005 to 2009. The full project has been sanctioned up to detailed design and tender stage. It was recently decided to fast-track the completion of the fit-out of the ward accommodation in the shelled-out area. This decision was taken to provide additional capacity more quickly than if the full project proceeded as a single construction contract. The design team is preparing detailed drawings with the intention of going to tender in March 2006. With this in mind, a prior indicative notice is to be lodged in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> by mid-October. Staff on site are to be fully consulted as part of the detailed design process. Planning permission is to be sought.by the beginning of November and the target completion date for the fit-out of the shelled area is early 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">On completion, the fit-out of the shelled accommodation will provide an additional 43 beds, mainly medical and surgical beds. The design work on the second stage of the project will continue in parallel with the fit-out and equipping of the shelled accommodation project. The second stage will include the provision of a pathology department, an operating department, medicine for the elderly-rehabilitation unit, acute psychiatric unit, child and adolescent psychiatric unit, occupational therapy department, administrative accommodation, staff accommodation, duration facilities, catering facilities and a new entrance concourse. The completion of the second stage of the project will provide a further 16 additional beds, mainly for day cases, as well as accommodating the transfer of 50 rehabilitation and acute psychiatric beds from facilities located outside the hospital. In all, there will be 109 additional beds on the hospital campus following the completion of the overall development.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The Health Service Executive has estimated additional revenue funding of €10 million, excluding inflation, will be required on an annual basis to run the shelled-out area when it is fully fitted-out. This estimate reflects a combination of the additional pay and non-pay costs required. Given the significant level of additional annual revenue costs associated with the project, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has decided that an independent review of the estimate is necessary, to ensure that the estimate and staff profile represent best value for money. This review is due to be completed prior to the finalisation of the tender documentation. It is not anticipated that it will delay the project.</p>

          <p eId="para_421">The Salesian College in Pallaskenry in County Limerick and the parents of its pupils were notified in July 2005 that the school transport facility, primarily for the Ballybrown and Clarina area, would not apply to first year pupils from September 2005 on. The parents were stunned by the announcement as they had enrolled their children for the school in November 2004. Over the last 15 years, a shared catchment area existed between city schools and Pallaskenry. The Department's decision has impacted on 34 first year pupils in Pallaskenry. Where is the logic in the Department of Education and Science supporting a considerable improvement in the Salesian College, Pallaskenry, in 2000 and then cutting off its potential student resource in the future by withdrawing school transport for first year pupils? Even if the pupils in the western side of the city had access to schools there they cannot get access to them. What is the point of exacerbating a bad traffic situation in the Limerick city area?</p>
          <p eId="para_422">When the parents discovered the directive in late July 2005 they were furious. Several meetings were held with politicians during the month of August to outline their frustration and request appropriate action. This was followed by proactive pressure on Ministers in the mid-west to persuade the Department of Education and Science to recognise the unique situation that prevailed and accede to the provision of transport for first year pupils. Despite protesting outside the Minister's own office, a subsequent meeting with her in Ennis and a bus journey with her to Ballyconnell in Cavan, in an attempt to highlight the issue with the Taoiseach, they have been unsuccessful and remain bitterly disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, has not issued a directive to the Department's officials requesting them to accommodate them.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The decision by the Department has fostered much bitterness in the area and has caused great inconvenience to both parents and pupils. Should the Department not change the decision then future implications for the college could be serious. It could lead to a reduction in first year pupils with parallel consequences for teachers and courses. This is an excellent school and I hope that sanity will prevail in the Minister's reply and that she will accede, as an injustice has been done in this case. The parents and pupils have been shabbily treated by the Department. The Minister should reverse the decision and allow school transport to be provided for the first year pupils who are currently deprived of this facility. I await her response.</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_424">I support Senator Finucane and ask the Minister to look compassionately at this unique situation, going back to 2001 where there were pupil-teacher ratio problems in the Limerick city catchment area resulting in pupils being allowed to go to Pallaskenry.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">As Senator Finucane has said, many meetings were held during the summer and it is time to find a solution. I believe that since the meetings took place the liaison officer on Limerick County Council, Mr. Seán Burke, has found additional places for 12 pupils owing to the Church of Ireland school in Adare having a larger bus which was able to be rerouted. It is possible at this late stage that when the final figures are received from Bus Éireann tomorrow additional places will be found but Bus Éireann has put on an additional bus returning from Pallaskenry since the start of the school term. The problem is not financial as it would only cost €19,000 for a morning bus. It is a unique situation where 50% of the pupils come from outside the Pallaskenry catchment area. The college in Pallaskenry would be non-viable without those pupils. The situation was reviewed in 2001 and I ask the Minister to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and review the situation at year end with a view to arriving at a final outcome. It would be in everyone’s interest for the pupils to be facilitated.</p>

        <speech by="#SiledeValera" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Miss de Valera</from>
          <p eId="para_426">I welcome this opportunity to outline to the Seanad my position regarding school transport to the Salesian College, Pallaskenry and Scoil Mhuire, Askeaton, County Limerick. One of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from schools and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Some 138,000 primary and post-primary pupils use the school transport scheme on a regular basis. The allocation for school transport in 2005 is €116.533 million which is an increase of 6% on last year's outturn. Approximately 30% of the allocation will be expended this year on transport costs and grant aid for children with special needs, who represent approximately 6% of the total number of children carried each day.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">For the purposes of post-primary education provision, the country is divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre. Under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme, a pupil is eligible for school transport if he or she resides 4.8 km, three miles, or more from the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they live. A post-primary centre is not necessarily a school building. It is usually a central point in the catchment area to which the distance from home is measured.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Eligible pupils who wish to attend post-primary schools in another catchment area may be allowed transport on school services from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended, subject to room being available on the school transport service and there being no additional cost to the State. The pupils themselves are responsible for getting to the nearest school bus service within that catchment area.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">An eligible pupil who is approved for catchment boundary transport is not guaranteed school transport for the duration of his or her education at that centre. As a concessionary measure, continued transport will depend on the availability of space on the school service to that centre each school term.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">A large number of pupils who reside in the Limerick city catchment area have been provided with full transport facilities to the Salesian College, Pallaskenry, because of difficulties encountered in previous years in securing placements in certain schools in Limerick city. A smaller number of such pupils were provided with full transport to Scoil Mhuire, Askeaton, for the same reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">However, as a result of the introduction of the Central Applications Facility for the allocation of places in Limerick city post-primary schools for the current school year, it became apparent that there were enough places in the city for all applicants from the catchment. Every child who applied for a place got one, and 95% received offers from one of their first three preferences. In the circumstances, it was decided to discontinue the practice of offering a special service to new catchment boundary pupils travelling to Pallaskenry and Askeaton. Existing passengers were reassured that they would have a place for the rest of their schooling, but new applicants were told they would have to be treated the same as catchment boundary applicants in other parts of the country. Catchment boundary transport will continue to be available to pupils enrolling inthe Salesian College, Pallaskenry, and ScoilMhuire, Askeaton, subject to the terms of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I do not propose to reverse my decision, which was made following a full assessment of all relevant factors. On the issue of catchment boundaries, there have been calls for local and general reviews of these boundaries to enable pupils to be accommodated with school transport to attend a school of their choice. I should explain that catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960s. For planning purposes, the country was divided into geographic districts, each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was that these defined districts would facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs. They also facilitated the provision of a national school transport service, enabling children from remote areas to get to their nearest school. While the service has been developed over the years to take account of linguistic and denominational considerations in the matter of school choice, it was never the intention that such choice would be unlimited. Clearly, the cost of operating such a scheme would be unsustainable, especially in the context of competing demands, including the major safety programme we are implementing at present. It is reasonable for parents to exercise educational choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">However, expectation as to the extent to which choice can be facilitated must be tempered with realism. A review of catchment boundaries may be appropriate where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a sole provider school closes due to declining enrolment.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">To revise boundaries in order to provide school transport for pupils to their school of choice would not be appropriate and it is not my intention to undertake such reviews. Any other approach would make it impossible to operate the school transport service on a cost-effective basis and could well give rise to additional costs related to additional teacher posts and accommodation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_436">I am very disappointed with the Minister of State's response as I believed that she empathized with the parents. In this case, pupils got very little notice from the Department of Education and Science as they were contacted in July. This could be a factor in a decision to make an exception in this case. I am disappointed, as will the parents and pupils in the area.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">I wish to enter in the record a letter that was sent out by the Department in 2001. A commitment was given at that stage that no changes would take place until discussions occurred with interested bodies.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">If bus transport is being provided out of Pallaskenry in the evening where surplus transport is available, it would not be an additional cost to the Exchequer. I ask the Minister of State that if a commitment was made that no changes would come about until a review of the catchment boundaries, whether the commitment made by the Department has been reneged upon.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">The situation has changed since 2001. It has been clear since 2003 that change was coming about because of the positions of placements within schools. The central applications facility is now in place. The reason for having this service until now in Limerick was because the parents could not find places for their children within the Limerick area. This is no longer the case due to the central applications facility. We are now giving the opportunity to children already on that bus to continue their education using the bus facility. However, it will no longer continue for first-year students because it is an anomaly. It is a unique situation made for Limerick given the circumstances that exist nowhere else in the country. That situation has now changed and the matter will revert to what occurs everywhere else in the country.</p>
