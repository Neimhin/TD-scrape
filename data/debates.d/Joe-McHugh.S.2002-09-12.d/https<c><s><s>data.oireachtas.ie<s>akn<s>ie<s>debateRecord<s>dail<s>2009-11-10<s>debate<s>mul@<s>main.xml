            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_14">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 13, inclusive, together</p>
            <p eId="para_15">On 7 July, I hosted a working lunch in Government Buildings for the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon.  Our discussions covered a number of key issues including progress on achieving the millennium development goals; the report of the Government's hunger task force; and the global challenge of climate change, including preparations for the UN summit which will take place in Copenhagen in December.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">During the course of our discussions I raised our concerns regarding the serious situation of the kidnappings of the two volunteer workers with GOAL in Sudan, which, thankfully, was recently resolved successfully.  I also pledged the ongoing support and assistance of Ireland for the work of the Secretary General and of the UN in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">On 22 September, I attended a high-level meeting on climate change in New York.  This was convened by the UN Secretary General in order to gather political momentum in the run up to the forthcoming UN summit in Copenhagen.  The meeting, which took place ahead of the G20 summit in Pittsburgh, was well attended at Heads of State and Government level and was the biggest ever gathering of political leaders to discuss climate change with a view to reaching what is hoped will be a comprehensive and effective international agreement.  The overall thrust of the interventions made at the meeting was one of political commitment to do more to address climate change.  At the plenary session, Chinese President Hu laid out a new plan to tackle China's emissions, tying them to economic growth.  President Obama outlined his Government's work on climate change since he took office and reaffirmed the United States' commitment to act decisively.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">During my intervention I said that we needed to take action now that is proportionate to the challenge facing us and that we must have meaningful proposals on the table in December on the basis of the Bali action plan which provides a clear framework for an international agreement.  The EU has already led the way with a commitment to a 20% reduction in emissions, to be stepped up to 30% as part of a global deal.  The global community must play its part in ensuring a fair and balanced overall agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">Regarding my travel plans for the remainder of 2009, it is my intention to attend the December European Council in Brussels and to attend the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen.  I will also attend the next summit of the British-Irish Council to be held on 13 November in Jersey.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">I did not formally meet the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board during my visit to the United States in September.  I last met the board during my St. Patrick's Day trip to the United States earlier this year as I reported to this House on 20 May last.  Currently, I have no plans to travel to the US again in 2009.  One would expect that I will travel to the US next March for the usual St. Patrick's Day celebrations.  A number of the members of the board were in attendance at the Global Economic Forum in Farmleigh over the weekend of 18 to 20 September and I met them informally on that occasion.  I also met some of them informally at an event which I addressed at the Amercian-Irish Historical Society while in New York on 22 September.  My Department maintains contact with the board primarily through the Irish Embassy in Washington, as well as through visits and meetings.</p>

            <p eId="para_21">During the Taoiseach's meeting with the Secretary General of the United Nations, did the Secretary General raise with him what Dóchas has called the "enormous and disproportionate" cuts in Ireland's ODA?  Was there any discussion about Ireland's commitment to ODA?  Was there any discussion as to how Ireland might now reach the UN target of 0.7% of GDP?</p>
            <p eId="para_22">I note that one of the forthcoming meetings the Taoiseach will attend is the British-Irish Council in December.  Does he have any plans to raise at that meeting or perhaps bilaterally yesterday's announcement by the British Government of its intention to expand its capacity to generate electricity from nuclear power stations and in particular the decision to locate a large number of those — I believe seven power stations — on the west coast of Britain, including at Sellafield and at Anglesey?  Is it still Government policy to oppose the expansion of nuclear generation in the United Kingdom and, if so, what action, if any, has been taken by the Government on this?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_23">Specific questions on energy matters are best put to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, who can outline the current situation in more accurate detail than I.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">In regard to the meeting last July with the Secretary General, the latter was quite praiseworthy of the progress Ireland has made in recent years in terms both of increasing the volume of our overseas development aid and enhancing the efficacy of how we work with United Nations agencies in its disbursement.  Ireland is seen as a very good global citizen in that respect.  While everybody acknowledges the budgetary problems that are affecting all developed economies, there is recognition that Ireland has made a series of huge strides in moving up the list of developed countries in terms of our provision of overseas development aid as a proportion of overall gross national product.  Far from being subject to criticism in this regard, the contrary was the case.  The Secretary General referred to the continuing commitment Ireland has demonstrated in this area, particularly in the past decade, as shown by the considerable resources we have allocated and the capacity-building in which we have engaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">In particular, there is welcome recognition of the work being done by the hunger task force which we launched last year.  The United Nations understands the focus we are trying to bring to that issue, as well as our focus on the need to assist smallholders in Africa, to deal with malnutrition, both maternal and infant, and the whole question of governance and the more effective tackling of global hunger issues by multilateral organisations, quite apart from bilateral aid programmes.  The United Nations regards Ireland's endeavours in this area as one of the best examples of a developing aid programme.  We are working with multilateral organisations to identify priority countries and are working closely with other contributors of development aid in those countries so that the maximum possible effectiveness can be achieved in respect of the overall development effort not only by Ireland but by the other contributing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">In regard to the British-Irish Council, the agenda for next Friday's meeting has already has been set and I understand it would not be possible for an announcement that was made yesterday to form part of that agenda.  We have had a view in regard to nuclear power in our jurisdiction, as well as concerns about nuclear generation in the neighbouring jurisdiction.  That general policy position still holds, although I note, as the Deputy did, yesterday's announcement by the British Government.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_27">Two aspects of the Taoiseach's reply surprise me.  First, it is surprising that the Secretary General of the United Nations should praise Ireland at a time when we are reducing our overseas development aid allocation.  Was there any discussion of how we now propose to reach our target of 0.7% of GDP and did the Taoiseach indicate to the Secretary General any timeframe in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_28">Second, in regard to the forthcoming meeting of the British-Irish Council, I am surprised at the Taoiseach's statement that this is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The question of Britain's nuclear industry and the consequences it has for this country, particularly the location of nuclear installations of one type or another on the west coast of Britain, has always been a matter which has been addressed at the highest level of government and which always has been a policy priority for Government.  I am surprised the Taoiseach said this has slipped down the order of priorities to the point that a major announcement by the British Government that it intends to expand its number of nuclear facilities and locate some of them in Sellafield and Anglesey, which is less than 50 miles across the sea from my constituency, for example, is not considered sufficiently important to be on the agenda of the British-Irish Council.  Was there consultation by the British authorities with the Government in respect of the expansion of their nuclear industry and the consequences that has for us?</p>
            <p eId="para_29">I recall when the Labour Party was in government that there was a successful direct intervention by that Government in respect of the expansion of a nuclear facility and I am surprised the present Government does not appear to be giving this issue the priority it requires to the point that the British Government and the British authorities clearly feel free to announce a major expansion of their nuclear capacity, locating seven of the facilities on the west coast, and it is not even on the agenda of the British-Irish Council.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_30">With respect to the Deputy, the questions relate to visits I may undertake in the coming period.  His first supplementary question was about the progress that has been made in the continuing interaction between the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and its counterpart in Britain regarding developments at Sellafield, for example, and I indicated that for the purposes of an updated, accurate reply, it would be best to table that question to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Such a supplementary was not envisaged in the context of the questions tabled to me regarding the matters outlined in them.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">Second, as I stated in my earlier reply, the Government deals with the British Government on this matter on an ongoing basis but a question about it without notice in regard to ministerial responsibility should be taken up with the Minister who can update the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">Third, I refer to his surprise that this issue is not on the agenda of the British-Irish Council.  The agenda has been set for some time in regard to the various governments and administrations that will attend the meeting based on the work that goes on there.  We would take up bilaterally with the British Government any development where we see a possible problem for us and it would not come within the ambit of the British-Irish Council.  That deals with strand three issues under the Good Friday Agreement.  We could take up the question of examining energy requirements for the jurisdictions generally with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_33">With regard to the question about the UN Secretary General, I do not understand why the Deputy should suggest there was surprise on his part regarding Ireland's record in this area.  We are in the top eight in the world per head of population in the provision of overseas development aid not only to the UN and its agencies, of which we have been a strong supporter, but also through our bilateral programmes.  When the Secretary General gets an opportunity to visit Ireland, it would be totally within his remit to commend successive Governments on the fact that among the 164 UN members we are in the top eight in the provision of overseas development aid according to our capacity.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_34">I thank the Taoiseach for his support for an Irish candidate in respect of the Presidency of the European Council.  He stated he intends to travel to Brussels for the meeting which will resolve that.  I have an internal list from Europe, which indicates at least 22 of the 27 member states have nominated their personnel for commissionerships.  They are currently engaged in serious lobbying for a range of positions.  When will the Taoiseach be in a position to announce the name of the nominee for Irish Commissioner, in view of the fact that 22 of the 27 member states are already engaged in serious lobbying?  Would it not be appropriate to make the announcement as soon as possible?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_7">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_35">The President of the Commission, to whom I have spoken on this matter, confirms that he is not in a position to consider the composition of the next Commission until the High Representative is appointed.  Under the new arrangements established by the Lisbon Treaty, the High Representative will be a vice-president of the Commission.  Until that matter becomes clear, which must be dealt with at a European Council meeting yet to be fixed, the President of the Commission is not in a position to make any arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_36">With regard to our own situation, I have spoken to the President of the Commission.  The matter is under consideration and is being finalised.  I will discuss it further with him this week.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_8">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_37">On this list a range of desired portfolios is given in respect of each nomination from the 22 member states.  They include climate, enterprise, budget, economic and monetary affairs and foreign security policy.  I accept that the process cannot be concluded until the High Representative, who will probably come from the socialist group, is appointed.  In any event, the lists of candidates for that and other positions have been narrowed down to a small number.  Serious lobbying is taking place for desired commissionerships.  The Government, therefore, should consider carefully where we want to be placed in the commissionership league.  It is because of Ireland's approval of the Lisbon treaty that every country will have a Commissioner.  From that reason, member states are conscious of the importance of commissionerships to the Irish people.  We endorsed a treaty which would give every country a Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">Last March the Taoiseach launched a review of Ireland-US relations and the establishment of a new Irish-American leadership council.  I understand the council has met only once, in October last.  When will its next meeting be held?  Was there an outcome from the first meeting or did the council simply agree to meet again?  Will the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board, which has been in existence for some time, operate in future?</p>
            <p eId="para_39">When the Taoiseach was dealing with the relationships between Ireland and the United States he did a comprehensive review and said it was his intention to appoint new consuls to Atlanta and Houston.  Is that process in train and is an announcement pending regarding those consulates?  Will it be necessary to acquire residential or office property in those locations?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_40">The Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board was established in late 1992.  Its purpose is to engage corporate leaders in the United States in an effort to promote Ireland as an investment location, to avail of their help in the Northern Ireland situation and to respond to Irish-American leaders' willingness to be identified with Irish issues.  Meetings with the board provide an invaluable insight into current and future business trends and an assessment of the US economy and the future prospects for US companies investing in Ireland.  The discussions also tend to cover Ireland's own economic performance, initiatives taken by the Government to promote indigenous and foreign investment and an assessment of the Northern Ireland situation.  It is a useful source of advice and personal contacts among the Irish-American business community.  The Irish Embassy maintains very close contact with board members who are an important source of advice and assistance for us.  Likewise, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland have offices in key US locations and are in constant contact with important US investors in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">The Deputy referred to the strategy report undertaken by the ambassador to the United States, Ambassador Collins, on the initiative of Government.  In the aftermath of what has been thus far a successful implementation of many aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement, although there is a still work to be done in that respect, I felt it was timely to review our relationships and how we can continue to encourage that rapport and close contact with the United States, not only with its Administration but in terms of what role the diaspora could play in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">There is not as much travel by Irish people to the United States as was the case in previous generations.  We all know from our family connections, if nothing else, that over quite a short period of time — a matter of a few decades — and from one generation to the next, we can see a very quick and, in many respects, a natural lessening in the ties that bind us.  That can happen very quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">Similarly with relationships between states, it is very important we do not take for granted the relationship with the United States.  Having obviously consulted many community and other leaders among Irish Americans and people outside the diaspora, the ambassador brought forward this report.  It is by its nature a long-term strategy and it is not about changing the situation overnight.  As time moves on, we must see in what way we maintain our influence.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">For example, we saw the demise of Senator Ted Kennedy.  He is a recent example of a strong political personality who passed from the stage.  How to replace that void in political terms is not something which can be done overnight or at the flick of a switch.  It requires developing a rapport and relationships with political figures on both sides of the aisle in the United States on an ongoing basis which cannot replace immediately such a major figure for us.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">Many people want to assist and help.  What that strategy outlines is that over time, we need to increase our physical presence throughout the United States.  It does not necessarily mean adding huge costs to existing operations.  We may have to try to see in what way existing budgets can be prioritised to accommodate these types of developments which are envisaged in the same way as we must in our domestic policy framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">One of the recommendations was this idea of an Irish-American leadership council.  Members of the council met the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his visit to the United States.  It is not an executive body.  Again, it is about having a structure that will enable people from different walks of life, and not only the commercial or corporate side of America, to be part of a structure which would interface with Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">One of the great outcomes, or one of the most important legacies of the peace process, in particular in America, has been that all strands of opinion in the diaspora are working hand in hand with the Government.  That is something we need to elevate and work on because in the past, I am convinced there were many missed opportunities owing to the disparate opinions taken by different elements of the diaspora over time in regard to the Troubles in Northern Ireland, etc.  Thankfully, we have found an inclusive way forward in which people's political aspirations or views can be accommodated on the basis of adherence to the democratic principles.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">More important, many people are now working on a common agenda with regard to developing the country and developing investment opportunities, ensuring that trade and investment into the United States by Irish companies can be successful.  A significant change has occurred because of the fact we have settled political differences in that respect.  The ambassador's strategy report is a first step of many that will need to be taken to address this loosening of ties that can happen very quickly, almost in front of our eyes if we are not careful.  The report contains many recommendations on how we then ensure that people's sense of identity in the United States, even if they are third, fourth or fifth generation beyond the original connection, and that their sense of Irishness can be accommodated and acknowledged.  This is the context of the report.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_10">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_49">I share many of the Taoiseach's views with regard to Ireland's relationship with the United States.  I had a recent brief meeting with Ambassador Rooney.  He is a good man with a great love of Ireland and I am confident he will do whatever he can to continue the very strong relationship between our two countries.  Is the Taoiseach happy with the reports from IDA Ireland in respect of the pipeline for investment from the United States, that it is still strong and that opportunities are still there?  Is he concerned about the clear lack of competitiveness in business here?  I am sure the Government is reflecting on this point.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">Can the Taoiseach provide any update on the proposal by President Obama and the White House to deal with income generated by multinationals outside the United States which would have an impact on Ireland?  Can he provide any update on the discussions about Irish illegal immigrants, the undocumented Irish, as they are known?  The Taoiseach is well acquainted with this problem.  There appears to be a divergence of opinion because on the one hand the Taoiseach is looking for comprehensive and specific legislation from the White House and the US Congress and others, in respect of Ireland.  Is there any update available in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The Taoiseach will be attending the Copenhagen conference on climate change.  Does he accept we are not going to get anywhere unless there is an acceptance of a massive transfer of resources from richer to poorer countries and that unless world leaders, the European Union, the United States, India, China and others, sign up, no progress will be made as a result of the conference?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_11">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_52">With regard to investment, even in the past five years there has been a significant change in the profile of investment.  Five years ago, 10% of IDA-approved projects from the United States were in the area of research and development whereas 40% of the investments last year were in that category.  This demonstrates the strong capital-intensive commitment being made by multinationals in Ireland on a continuing basis.  They regard the location in Ireland of research and development facilities as deepening the roots of their activities in Ireland.  By definition, the spin-off benefits from research and development are not immediately known but it is a good indication of their commitment to Ireland as an investment location that this is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_53">As Deputy Kenny observed, the broader competitiveness issues must be confronted and addressed by the Irish economy in the new economic situation that has now developed as a result of the worst financial and economic crisis we have seen in a long time.  We have to try and address these issues in our domestic policy framework while at the same time continuing to be competitive in respect of international investment flows.  Our main competitors for attracting foreign investment activities are places such as Singapore, Korea and Israel.  It is very important that we continue to support and listen attentively to what IDA Ireland has to say about the evolving trends which become evident in the field.  It is important to make the point that 40% of IDA investment last year was research and development-related, a big change even in four or five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">The matter of the location of the United States as a place for Ireland to do business is not only restricted to the IDA.  I have attended or been involved with Enterprise Ireland-related exercises and trade missions.  Many businesses accompanied us during the St. Patrick's Day period.  The successful business being done by Irish business people there is a timely reminder to all of us that while people have the right and entitlement to portray the difficulties through which the Irish economy is passing at the moment, many enterprising people, entrepreneurs, business people and Irish companies are getting business and ensuring they are diversifying and getting into other areas of activity.  It was very heartening to see their demeanour, attitude and the can-do approach that epitomises everything they have been doing there and the resulting successful outcomes.  In addition, the good word for Enterprise Ireland among native Irish business people is encouraging.  We have seen a big reform of that organisation in recent years under the leadership of Mr. Ryan and others.  It is very focused and those of us who have reason to be in touch with the business community through various positions acknowledge that both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland serve us and the businesses community well.  There is never room for complacency and no one could ever claim there is no room for improvement but I have been very heartened by what I have seen and heard from those for whom these agencies have been set up in the first place.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">I refer to Deputy Kenny's question about the tax haven situation.  It was very clear from my discussions with President Obama when we visited the USA on St. Patrick's Day that Ireland is not being contemplated or categorised in respect of that aspect of policy under review within the Obama Administration.  The level of economic activity here in respect of the investment made here is transparent and clear.  We are in compliance with all international treaty obligations and there is a recognition that Ireland has a competitive corporation tax.  It is applicable to all companies and we do not deal in any differentiated way with anyone.  There are other countries which have nominally higher corporate tax rates, which on an <i>ad hoc</i> or individual basis provide various opportunities for investment or improved terms and conditions for those who locate in such countries but which are not as transparent or as open as Ireland.  We should not have anything to fear in any way or suggest we have anything to hide; quite the contrary.  We have one of the most transparent corporate taxation arrangements anywhere in the developed world.  The move to 12.5% as a corporate tax rate generally was a very wise decision, the process was completed over a period, it serves the country well and we should be mindful of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">I am not aware to what extent there has been any progress in the United States Congress in respect of the policy initiative getting legislative legs or to what extent legislation is being prepared.  It is a longer process than people think.  However, the US Treasury Secretary and others have referred to it.  Obviously, our people are keeping a very close eye on developments.  We are ensuring our situation is well understood and comprehended.  My information is that the representations we continue to make confirm that Ireland is not in the sights of those who seek out certain jurisdictions the tax status of which is very preferential <i>vis-à-vis</i> American companies and what such companies pay in their own country.  This must be examined in terms of where those profits are being decided upon in some of those locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">The issue of illegal immigration was raised with US Secretary of State Clinton when she came here in another capacity regarding Northern Ireland.  We have met members of the committee that deals with this issue.  Some prominent members of the committee visited Ireland some months ago and I had the opportunity to meet them.  This is a very sensitive issue in domestic politics in the United States for obvious reasons.  A bipartisan approach provides the best prospect of success.  Many prominent people on both sides of the aisle, like the late Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain, unfortunately were not successful in their efforts to propose comprehensive legislation on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">It is obvious that it will not be dealt with on a country-by-country basis.  An overall legislative response is envisaged in seeking to find out the realistic situation politically on Capitol Hill.  Conveying the fact that we understand it is a difficult issue and that we seek to be accommodated under the overall umbrella is the best approach we can take.  We must build support for the particular Irish issues that arise, recognising that we are not the only people with a problem in this regard.  Other countries and other nationalities are involved and we must find a common solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">The final supplementary question concerned the Copenhagen meeting.  It is clear from the European Council conclusions on 29 and 30 October that the European Union is prepared to go further than it already has gone.  It has taken a leadership role in this area but other parts of the world must come up front and see what contribution they can make.  The conclusions confirm the commitment of the European Union but recognise that this is not something we can do alone.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">I appreciate that.  The brevity of the Taoiseach's answer causes my additional questions.  I understand from the Taoiseach's reply that he will attend the Copenhagen meeting.  That is very welcome news to Members of the House.  It sends a strong message that Ireland is committed to dealing with climate change.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider that the message might be stronger if he was to attend carrying in his briefcase a climate change Bill published ahead of his visit with the support of all parties.  The Taoiseach is aware of the Oireachtas committee report that sets out the heads of such a Bill.  It has all-party support and strong support from the Fianna Fáil committee members.  Will the Minister ensure that this Bill is published before he attends the Copenhagen meeting?</p>
            <p eId="para_64">Regarding overseas development aid, can the Taoiseach assure us that the commitments made by Ireland to deal with the management of climate change in poor countries will not be removed from the overseas development aid budget but will be additional to it?</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I am aware the committee of which Deputy McManus is a member has produced a report and the heads of a Bill on this question.  It is a matter for the Minister and the Government to decide what contribution that can make to legislation envisaged in this area.  The goodwill of the European Union is not in question on this matter.  We have set out our targets and in the conclusions of the European Council we set out that we are prepared to go further, but it is strongly conditional.  Success at Copenhagen will not be determined by the number of domestic Governments submitting targets they have agreed to individually and collectively in the EU, although I understand that this is not what Deputy McManus suggests.  It will be determined by the preparedness of other parts of the world to make a proportionate contribution based on the scientific evidence available.</p>

            <p eId="para_67">We have a lead role.  The European Union will be led and chaired by the Danish Prime Minister and the Danish Government which have been tasked with this job.  The Swedish Presidency and the Commission have been in Delhi and the United States in the past seven days meeting the Obama Administration, the Indian Administration and the Chinese in an effort to ensure that people come to Copenhagen, on the basis of what they had to say at the UN summit called by the Secretary General, with money and a commitment to do the business.  That is the defining issue as to whether we will have an outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">The most optimistic of advocates of this issue would confirm that it is unlikely a full treaty will be agreed at Copenhagen but what we need to see is that the basic principles and commitments are made so that the detailed work that would follow on from that can be taken as simply the detail beyond the political agreement.  In fairness, the European Union is working hard and Ireland has been quite supportive.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">Deputy McManus is acutely aware that this is a very technical area and Ireland has been broadly happy with the way the burden-sharing arrangements are being handled.  There is still a working group to be undertaken and many member states have concerns about this area but that is a matter for the Union to solve.  The Union is taking a leadership role on the global issue and has put its cards on the table in a far more transparent way than others.  It is now up to others to come forward with the same degree not only of enthusiasm but evidence that they are prepared to put resources behind what they have to say.</p>

        <b>Deputy Joe Carey</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         his plans to amend the Sex Offenders Act 2001; and his views on the effectiveness of the legislation. 
        [40406/09]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_21">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_73">The Sex Offenders Act 2001 introduced a wide range of measures aimed at reducing the risk to the public from convicted sex offenders.  These measures include the notification system, also known as the sex offenders register, the civil sex offender order, the provision of information for employment purposes and post-release supervision of convicted sex offenders by the probation service.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">As the Act has now been in operation for more than eight years, the time is opportune for a complete evaluation of its effectiveness and that evaluation is currently under way in my Department.  It forms an integral part of a major review of the criminal law governing sexual offences.  The review takes into account the discussion document on the management of sex offenders and the views of interested groups made to my Department.  I am also in favour of a greater approximation of the laws North and South of the Border, in particular on the operation of the respective notification systems, so that sex offenders will gain no advantage in living in or visiting either side of the Border.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">It is likely that the evaluation of the 2001 Act will give rise to a recommendation for a substantial list of amendments and changes to it and when the review has been completed I will seek Government approval for the necessary legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">I am satisfied that the 2001 Act is operating well but that after eight years it is appropriate to consider whether it is possible to examine and improve its operation and to include in it further provisions to protect the public, in particular with advances in technology since the Act was passed into law.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_77">Sex offenders represent approximately 8% of the country's overall prison population.  Sex offenders cause huge concern to their victims and to the communities into which they are released.  I was disturbed to read a recent article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> which proclaimed that Ireland has been a haven for 69 sex offenders since 2004.  Is the Minister satisfied with the present legislation?</p>
            <p eId="para_78">I welcome the Minister's announcement of a review but when will its findings be published?  Is he confident that existing legislation is robust enough to deal with sex offenders originating from this country or abroad?  What has he done to stop sex offenders from entering the country?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_23" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_79">The Bill we are preparing will probably be introduced next year.  As I noted earlier, among the matters under consideration is bringing our notification system into line with that of the Northern authorities.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I raised this issue with my counterpart, Mr. Peter Hain, because I felt that we could marry our operations on both sides of the Border.  That process is ongoing because there is much we can learn from each other.  There have been several cases involving people crossing the Border.  We are also considering a reduction in the period for notification by convicted sex offenders of their addresses and the issue of sex grooming on the Internet.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">At present, approximately 325 people are in prison for sex offences, with a further 1,100 on the register and 120 on post-release orders.  Our existing legislation is robust but we are not complacent and will review it.  Other issues must also be considered in the context of the legislation, not least among them the deliberations of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">We passed the legislation and it is up the Garda to implement it.  I intend to bring forward proposals on the electronic tagging of sex offenders in the not too distant future.  An interim report published in June by my Department recommended introducing this practice on a pilot basis and I want to move on this as quickly as possible, although obviously I must achieve value for money.  We think the measure can be viable provided it is kept to a reasonably small cohort of sex offenders on release.  However, I must await the final report, which I expect in the not too distant future, before making a decision.</p>

         the number of recorded cases of so-called tiger robberies, in which staff or relatives of staff of financial institutions were taken hostage to date in 2009; the amount of money taken in such robberies; the discussions he has had with the financial institutions about these robberies; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [40405/09]

          </question>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_26" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_84">In the nature of democratic politics we disagree on many issues in this House.  However, I believe we are at one in condemning what have come to be known as tiger kidnappings and in offering our full sympathy to the victims of such heinous crimes.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">I am advised by the Garda authorities that five tiger kidnappings have taken place to date this year.  While it is a matter of public record that these included the robbery of a very substantial amount of money from the Bank of Ireland at College Green, I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that for operational reasons it is the policy not to disclose the sums involved in these incidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">The Deputy will be aware that detailed and comprehensive protocols and response procedures have been agreed between the Garda Síochána and the financial institutions to deal with situations where members of staff or their families are taken hostage in order to facilitate robberies of such institutions.  The Garda Síochána does not, for obvious security reasons, publicly disclose information relating to protocols and procedures.  Regular meetings are held between the Garda Síochána and representatives of the financial institutions to discuss issues relating to their security arrangements, including the issue of tiger kidnappings.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner and I jointly met with the chief executives of various financial institutions last week to discuss this issue and to outline our concerns in this regard.  I do not doubt the commitment of the banks to the well-being of their staff or their desire to help foil these crimes.  However, it is crucial that the protocols are followed, and both the Garda Commissioner and I emphasised this to the banks at our meeting.  Following that meeting, a number of further measures and policy decisions which I cannot disclose publicly at this time are being taken, including the limiting of access to cash.  I will also be meeting representatives of the credit unions and the Irish Banking Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">I do not for a moment underestimate the pressure to which the victims of tiger kidnappings are subjected.  Following my meeting last week with the heads of the major banks, I will meet later this week with representatives of employees of financial institutions to hear their views and discuss what more can be done to ensure their safety.  I assure the House and the employees of financial institutions that the Garda Síochána's absolute priority when faced with an incident of this kind is to ensure that no harm comes to the victims.  However, as I stated in the House last week, it is in the interest of everyone, and the staff of financial institutions in particular, that the protocols are observed.  These are in place first and foremost to protect employees.  It is important to recognise that we will only stop tiger kidnapping attempts by rendering them unsuccessful and thereby protecting innocent employees from being caught in them in the future.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_27">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_89">The Minister is correct in assuming that every Member of this House agrees these are appalling crimes and that our sympathy is with the victims and their families.  However, is he not concerned that so-called tiger kidnappings are on the increase and is it not reasonable to presume that the very large sums of money garnered in some of these incidents are used for the financing of more serious crime, such as drugs trafficking and firearms purchases?</p>
            <p eId="para_90">Each time a tiger kidnapping takes place, the Minister issues strong warnings to the financial institutions and those who are responsible but little else seems to be done between one incident and the next.  Too frequently, we have seen similar incidents occur shortly after the lessons were supposed to have been learned.  Is he satisfied from his discussions with the senior executives of the financial institutions that they are taking the matter as seriously as they should in the interests of their staff and combating crime?  The man and woman on the street have reservations about whether the fine words are being translated into action.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_28" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_91">I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the Government is very concerned about what has happened in recent times.  There were nine events in 2006, although not all were successful, four in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and five in 2009 to date.  These events cause major trauma to the victims and their families and, often, to bank employees even where they were not directly involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">One of the developments from last week's meeting is that local gardaí will regularly visit financial institutions' premises to liaise with staff.  Our discussions focused on the concern that individuals continue to have access to large amounts of money and ensuring that people are not put under duress.  It is my experience of dealing with this matter over the past 18 months that anywhere the protocols have been complied with they have been successful from a law enforcement point of view.  Given that they now appear to be targeting families as well as individual bank officials, there is grave concern that, God forbid, someone will be injured in any subsequent incident.  I want to widen the discussions to listen to the views of the Irish Bank Officials Association on what more can be done.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_29">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_93">Let me give the Minister the example of the €7.6 million taken in a recent robbery of this type in a Dublin bank.  How did an employee, admittedly one operating under duress, have such easy access to retrieve the amount of money handed over?  The robbery was followed by press statements or behind the scenes briefings by the Garda that a great deal of the money was recovered.  I understand only a limited amount was recovered.  While it is all very well for the Minister to state that protocols are not being complied with in some cases, is he satisfied that the content of the protocols is adequate to meet this modern day scourge?</p>
            <p eId="para_94">I concur with the Minister that the safety of bank officials and their families must come first.  Since he failed to comment on my earlier remark, I repeat that the only reasonable conclusion one can draw is that these robberies are carried out for the purpose of funding and financing more serious crime and the trafficking of drugs into this jurisdiction.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_30" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_95">I agree with the Deputy.  The Government and all Deputies are concerned about the safety of ordinary individuals and civilians caught up in these robberies.  That is our number one priority and in case anyone in the banking fraternity believes otherwise, the safety of individuals is also the absolute priority of the Garda in these types of incidents.  The secondary concern is to prevent such crimes from taking place in the first instance and, where they do take place, to apprehend the criminals involved.  The priority of ensuring the safety of individuals is the reason early warning is crucial.  Successful operations were mounted in cases where early warning was given.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">I concur with the Deputy that large amounts of money are getting into criminals' hands and feeding into their continuing crime, whether drugs, illegal firearms or another activity.  This is another worry for the Government and the reason, as I stated publicly, we must redouble our efforts in this area, particularly with regard to the way in which banks go about their business.  While I do not wish to comment on individual cases because people are before the courts, there is concern that large amounts of money are accessible to perhaps one or two individuals in banking institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">I note that one commentator referred today to my statement that, for whatever reason, more cash per head of population circulates in this State than elsewhere.  In mainland Europe, many countries have limited cash available and transactions are carried out using plastic.  The issue, about which I have had discussions with my Government colleagues, must be addressed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_102">I am informed by the Garda Síochána that in 2008, some 96 investigations were commenced where human trafficking was alleged or suspected.  Of these, 60 investigations relate to suspected breaches of the provisions of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, while 36 investigations relate to suspected breaches of the provisions of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">Provisional figures for 2009 indicate that, up to 9 November, some 57 incidents have been recorded by the Garda Síochána under the category of human trafficking offences.  Of these, 37 relate to possible offences under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, some 18 relate to possible offences under the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 and the remaining two relate to possible offences under the Child Pornography Act 1998.  In the cases in question, 31 of the persons involved have made a claim of asylum and as part of their claim have alleged they were the victims of human trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">A number of files are with the Director of Public Prosecutions for a decision on whether to prosecute.  One case is before the courts where a person is charged with a human trafficking offence under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 in relation to the trafficking of a child for sexual exploitation.  A total of 11 persons have been identified as suspected victims of human trafficking on the basis that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she was a victim of an offence under section 2 or 4 of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.</p>

Will the Minister comment on the report produced by the US State Department which states the Government of Ireland does not fully comply with minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking?  The report focuses on two issues.  It refers to the lack of any prosecution or conviction in the reporting period, although I note the Minister indicated that one prosecution is pending, and is critical of the identification of victims and protection afforded to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">Under the Government's anti-human trafficking plan, the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, will house suspected victims of human trafficking.  Given that 70% of suspected victims are residents of asylum or Health Service Executive hostels and, according to a report produced by a Galway rape crisis centre, 20% or one in five of the women who reported rape or abuse were asylum seekers, a group which makes up only 1% of the population of Galway, is the Minister satisfied that RIA is the appropriate agency to deal with this matter?</p>

            <p eId="para_107">Yes, I am satisfied RIA is the appropriate agency.  During discussions on this issue with the Garda and other agencies, no major issues were raised regarding the use of RIA accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">On the Deputy's question on the number of cases with the Director of Public Prosecutions, the figure is not provided on the file.  Since the passing of the Act in June 2008, some 73 investigations have commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">On the criticisms in the US report, I raised this issue with a representative of the United States Embassy when I had an opportunity to do so.

            <p eId="para_112">I noted that 11 persons have been granted temporary permission to reside here for six months.  Of these, two were granted a second period of six months and six were given the recovery and reflection period of 60 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">To return to the Reception and Integration Agency, those entering the RIA system are given full medical screening, including a medical card, and access to a full range of services.  They are looked after well, as they should be, in order that their case can be investigated.  Recently, a Deputy raised a case which may have involved human trafficking.  On investigation, no evidence of human trafficking was found.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">The Department is worried about this issue and will continue to monitor it.  I have also raised it with my Northern counterparts because the Border is used in some cases.  Of the 73 investigations, 10% relate to labour while the balance relates to potential sexual exploitation.</p>

            <p eId="para_115">I thank the Minister for the figures he presented to the House.  On those figures, 11 out of the 73 cases being investigated by the Garda have been defined as suspected victims of trafficking.  We are now 15 or 16 months into the enactment of the legislation.  Is the Minister satisfied with the period of time it takes An Garda Síochána to decide that someone is a suspected victim?  At that stage, and only at that stage, a full investigation into the case takes place.  Surely the Minister is risking a situation arising whereby some of the victims may be coerced back into the industry before we give them the 60 day or 90 day notice period required.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">These investigations are very complex and time consuming.  The Garda has to go through procedures in regard to identification and assessment but it is not true to say that there has not been action.  There have been three European arrest warrants granted in regard to people who were trafficking into this country.  Major prosecutions are taking place in a number of European countries, including Romania, in regard to events which happened in Ireland.  We have worked very closely with Romania, the UK and the Netherlands on this issue.  We have a specially designated human trafficking unit in the Department, where a number of officials work with State agencies and NGOs in order to try and address this problem.  It is working very well and they are pushing out the boundaries on what more can be done to assist in this area.  As the Deputy is aware I propose in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill to extend the period of recovery and reflection to a higher level to give people an opportunity to be looked after and to co-operate in order that we can ground a prosecution in this respect.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">Operations against persons involved in serious crime in this jurisdiction are undertaken on an ongoing basis.  Such criminals, their operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are proactively targeted through intelligence-led operations such as Operation Anvil.  Such operations are primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda Síochána, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda national drugs unit and organised crime unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Of course, multi-agency approaches play a key role in these matters and will continue to be used in our response to such crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">The Criminal Assets Bureau is being actively utilised to identify and target funds accumulated by criminals in order to seize such assets and to deprive them of the profits of their criminal activity.  The social welfare inspectors attached to it investigate and determine the social welfare entitlements of persons who are suspected of deriving assets from criminal activity and officers from the Department of Social and Family Affairs can make referrals to it for investigation.  In addition, Garda Síochána asset profilers, of which there are 103 and who collate information at a local level and carry out preparatory groundwork in advance of a full investigation by CAB, are now in place in every Garda division.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">Since its inception in 1996, the CAB has saved over €4 million in social welfare payments and recovered overpayments of almost €3 million.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs continues to make very considerable savings in its Vote through fraud controls with savings estimated at €476 million being achieved in 2008.  In support of this work, the Department has an extensive legal structure to facilitate the sharing of data with other Departments and specified bodies, such as An Garda Síochána, for the purpose of combating social welfare fraud and data matching is used as a method of identifying high risk social welfare claims for review.  There is also close co-operation between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and An Garda Síochána on the ground in regard to multi-agency vehicle checkpoints and personation cases.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs control division also deal with individual inquiries from An Garda Síochána as they arise concerning the types of issue raised by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_121">It seems that much is happening in this area but it is not in many other areas.  Operation Anvil forced a lot of the criminals out of Dublin and moved them a number of miles north, south, east and west of Dublin.  The Minister referred to CAB.  When I proposed a regional version of it I was pooh-poohed.  The Minister said there are a number of profilers, but they are not operating on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">The Minister said €4 million was saved in social welfare payments to those engaged in criminal activities.  If €4 million a month was saved one would think it was fine but savings of €4 million since 1993——</p>

            <p eId="para_124">I am referring to approximately €4 million in social welfare fraud saved by the CAB.  It should be €4 million a month.  A number of criminals go to dole offices.  How much liaison is there between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda and the Department of Social and Family Affairs?  Are they liaising on the ground on a district-by-district and Garda station by Garda station basis?  That is what should be happening.  Without doing that the Minister's response is irrelevant at a time when people on the ground are acting criminally.</p>

            <p eId="para_125">From the point of view of the CAB, there are 103 criminal asset profilers in total, which are based in every Garda division in the country and operate at a local level, dealing with social welfare queries.  As the Deputy knows, social welfare officials are also seconded to the CAB.  Multi-agency checkpoints also operate in localities.  When I was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I tried to instigate such measures and now that I am Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform we have again revamped them because they are very important, particularly to prevent gangs going across the country from one area to another.  In that respect, multi-agency vehicle checkpoints operate in which the Garda, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and other State Departments are involved.  I do not agree with the Deputy that investigations are not happening at a local level because they are and there is contact, irrespective of the CAB, between gardaí at a local level with Department of Social and Family Affairs officials on a regular basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_136">I attach a high level of importance to the achievement of the maximum levels of safety for local communities, in particular through the tackling of problems resulting from the misuse of alcohol.  This is reiterated in the renewed programme for Government which contains a specific commitment that we will continue to target Garda actions within communities experiencing significant anti-social behaviour.  In this regard, the provisions of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 which I piloted through this House, particularly those relating to public order, have been of substantial assistance.  A measure of the level of Garda activity in the area of public order, such as targeting public order hot-spots, is the fact that over 650,000 offences were detected since February 2002 as a result of Operation Encounter.  I welcome the fact that as a result of this activity the number of disorderly conduct offences decreased by 7% in the 12 month period up to the end of September.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">The Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for civil proceedings in regard to anti-social behaviour by adults and children and sets out an incremental procedure for addressing such behaviour.  The intention was that these interventions would address the problem behaviour.  It is only if they fail to lead to a behaviour adjustment by the person in question that a court order will be applied for.  I do not accept that these provisions are not effective.  To date, 2,464 behaviour warnings have been issued.  Nevertheless, as these provisions have been operating since 2007, I believe it is appropriate to review their operation to see whether any improvements can be made, and in this regard my Department is in consultation with the Garda authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_138">The IPA has conducted an opinion poll, which shows that 76% of the public rate youth crime as a major national problem.  As a result, there is a significant number of people who are intimidated, whether easily or not.  These people are in their homes, worried, afraid and concerned.  On far too many occasions the gardaí are contacted but nobody is available to come to aid these people.  The 7% decrease is a result of nobody being able to deal with the problems.</p>

I agree with the Deputy in that the issue of public order or disorder is of grave concern to ordinary constituents.  That is why the Garda has dramatically increased the number of community gardaí, and there are now approximately 1,000 dedicated community gardaí whose sole job is to work in the community and deal with people at a local level.</p>

Despite that, I have accepted that there is a perception among people, not least the Deputy, that the process is not working and I have asked my Department to have another look at it to see if we can make any changes.  Ultimately, the success of the initiative is being measured by in effect criminalising young people in particular.  If a young person gets a warning and behaves thereafter, we should not, for the sake of statistics, force the Garda to criminalise people by serving them with an order or bringing them before a court to get an order.  It is not a solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_157">The people who ignore the original warning and a contract that they may have entered into can be brought to the ultimate sanction but the process is incremental.  The fact that so many warnings are given that do not end up in orders proves the opposite of the Deputy's contention.</p>

It had been intended to have the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 fully implemented during 2010 in respect of children between five and 18 years of age.  This would have required significant additional investment in 2009 and 2010 to prepare the education and health sectors for the operation of the legislation and to support the statutory processes that would be required.  In the light of the current financial circumstances, it has become necessary to defer further implementation of the two Acts.  The Government will keep this matter under review and is committed to the full implementation of both Acts at the earliest possible date.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">The statutory basis for the introduction of a personal advocacy service under the Citizen's Information Board was provided for in the Citizen's Information Act 2007 but it was not possible, due to budgetary circumstances, to proceed with the service in 2008 as planned and this remains the case.  The provision of an advocacy service remains a priority for the Government, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Citizen's Information Board.  The board has developed a community and voluntary sector advocacy programme for people with disabilities and has funded 46 separate advocacy projects.  Up to the end of October 2009,  5,550 members of the public had availed of the services provided by the projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">Sectoral plans, also provided for in the Disability Act 2005, are an integral part of the national disability strategy.  They contain the service delivery and implementation arrangements of six Departments.  The sectoral plans were published in December 2006 and in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act, they are due to be reviewed and progress reported by the end of the year.  The National Disability Authority is assisting with the process of the reviews and representatives of people with disabilities are involved in consultation with the Departments and with the authority.  There is no doubt that Ireland is faced with a particularly difficult and uncertain point of economic transition which requires  re-prioritisation of public expenditure. Nevertheless, the Government and social partners have confirmed their commitment to work towards the long-term goals set down in Towards 2016 for each stage of the life cycle, that is, children, people of working age, older people and people with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">The national disability strategy as endorsed by the Government and social partners in Towards 2016 continues to be the focus of policy.  Implementation of the strategy is prioritised in the renewed programme for Government and will continue to be monitored rigorously.  The Government will ensure that the national disability strategy is driven and managed from a whole of Government perspective and will continue to prioritise and protect this important area of Government policy.</p>

            <p eId="para_166">Does the Minister of State agree that the disability strategy is now in tatters?  He has already outlined the key elements of the strategy, including the Disability Act, the EPSEN Act and the Citizen's Information Act.  The carers' strategy is also gone and we are still waiting for the mental capacity Bill.  Departmental plans have been delayed.  Is it not time for the Government to come forward with a realistic strategy and stop the bluffing that is going on and the pretence that something is happening?</p>
            <p eId="para_167">Why did it take the Department so long to supply figures to me on the amount of money spent in this area?  How much money has been spent since 2006 in the area?  I reckon it is only about €490 million out of a promised €900 million.  The Department of Health and Children is all over the place and is short by approximately €100 million on its spend.  I only got those figures about an hour ago but I asked the questions of the Minister six months ago.  There is great disparity in the figures so will the Minister of State explain them?</p>

            <p eId="para_168">I do not think there is great disparity in the funding.  If the Deputy had the chance to read the renewed programme for Government, he would see that the Government has again committed to supporting the national disability strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_170">I will come to that.  It is also important to make the point that not alone is the Government supporting it in words, it has committed to a disability strategy based on the possible effects of the recession.  This has been accepted by the disability groups, most of whom I have met.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">On the funding, while we could not support the EPSEN Act fully last year, some €10 million was put specifically into services for people with disabilities.  It was ring-fenced and provided 125 therapists.  The figure being spoken about by the Deputy is in excess of €800 million.  The requirements under the Disability Act are being met.</p>
            <p eId="para_172">With regard to the delay in providing the funding figures to the Deputy, it is a very busy Department that stretches across 633 groups in the disability sector.  There is no device to withhold information and there is the matter of pulling that information together from the many sectors involved.</p>

Will the Minister of State consider these figures and come back to me with a comprehensive and easily understood table of figures because I cannot follow the figures provided to me at all?  Hundreds of millions of euro are missing.  It took six months to get the figures to me, but they are still not right.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">Last year, €17 million in current funding that was supposed to be for disability services was handed back to the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  Why was that money not spent?  Is the Government taking this matter seriously?  In 2006, current spending on disability services was €71 million.  The estimated out-turn for this year is €3.6 million, which shows that the budget in this area has been filleted.  How will these people survive?  I ask the Minister of State to take this issue by the scruff of the neck.  He should give this House the information, which I asked for six months ago, in clear and comprehensible tabular form.  The people in question are insisting that they are not getting the money or the services.  Is it not time for the Minister of State to supply the clear information I asked for six months ago?</p>

The bottom line is that I have agreed a date to meet all the groups, to explain the value for money process and, most importantly, to explain the Government's commitment to retaining its belief in the national disability strategy.

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_183">I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 109 and 282 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the numbers of applications from members of the Garda Síochána to retire, voluntarily or on age grounds, that have been received so far in 2009, along with the numbers of members of the force who retired in each year from 2002 to 2008, are as set out in the table that follows this reply.  Practically all Garda retirements, whether they occur early or late in a member's career, are voluntary, in a technical sense, in that they do not occur on the last day of potential service.  An exceptionally small number of members of the force choose to serve until the day on which they must retire compulsorily on age grounds.  In summary, the figures show that the number of such voluntary retirements was 234 in 2002, 252 in 2003, 323 in 2004, 284 in 2005, 238 in 2006, 177 in 2007, 243 in 2008, with 708 applications so far in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">It is clear that the current rate of retirements represents an appreciable increase on previous years.  It must be remembered that the retirement age for the ranks of garda, sergeant and inspector was increased by three years, to 60, in 2006.  Three years on, we may be seeing an element of deferred retirements.  It is significant that even with this trend of increased retirements, 2009 will see an overall increase, to 14,716, in the number of attested gardaí with full police powers.  The number of personnel who will become attested this year — over 900 — significantly exceeds the anticipated rate of retirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">My top priority is to maintain the crime-fighting capacity of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Commissioner, who is mindful of the general moratorium on public service appointments and the need to make a strong case for any exceptions, has carefully assessed the capacity available to him at a senior level within the force.  The Commissioner's approach has been to identify those posts which are especially important for operational policing.   As a result of submissions to me from the Garda Commissioner and following agreement with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, the Government has confirmed the appointments of three chief superintendents, ten superintendents and two assistant commissioners since the introduction of the moratorium.  The Commissioner is carefully monitoring the situation and will continue to assess the policing capacity available to him in light of ongoing developments.  My officials and I will remain in close touch with him to ensure he continues to be in a position to maintain a viable command structure.</p>

            <p eId="para_282">I refer to the use of technology, for example.  I have given the House figures to demonstrate that more people are joining the Garda Síochána this year than are leaving the force.  The number of gardaí in the State will reach an all-time high of 14,800 later this year, despite the fact that the number of retirements will be greater than it has been in previous years, as a result of the commitment of the Government over recent years to increase the strength of the force.  It is clear that the effects of the moratorium on recruitment will be kept under review.  I have mentioned that the Government has agreed to make an exception to the moratorium in line with the case that was made to the Minister for Finance.  It has sanctioned the filling of a number of senior positions to ensure there is a proper command structure.  The Garda Commissioner and I are satisfied that the force has the required resources.  We will keep the situation under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_283">The Minister referred earlier to the number of gardaí on the ground.  Dundalk must be very well supplied with gardaí if the Minister thinks there are many gardaí on the ground.  If the Minister visits my constituency, he will not see many gardaí on the ground.  The gardaí in my area are entirely over-stretched in terms of numbers, etc.  I do not know how the Minister can be so complacent.  Is it not the case, on the basis of the figures the Minister has given the House, that more than three times the average number of gardaí will retire from the force this year, the end of which we have not reached?  If three times as many gardaí plan to retire in 2009 as in any of the previous seven or eight years, we cannot say it is not an unusual phenomenon.  If the Minister for Finance does not intend to tax the lump sum, would it not be helpful for him, or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to make a statement to that effect at this point, in the interests of helping the Garda to retain its experience and expertise?</p>

            <p eId="para_284">It was suggested by the Commission on Taxation — it may have been in the McCarthy report — that in the case of a public sector lump sum of over €200,000, the balance of the gratuity over that amount should be taxed.  I suspect that the vast majority of gardaí would not be affected by such a move.  It is probable that those at the very top of the Garda are the only people in the force who receive gratuities of over €200,000.  If the recommendation in question were to be implemented by the Minister for Finance in the forthcoming budget, I can hazard a guess that it would not affect anyone.</p>
            <p eId="para_285">I am not answerable for the life choices made by individual gardaí when they are contemplating whether to retire.  If a garda has completed 30 years of service and has reached the age of 50, he or she can retire.  In such circumstances, he or she will receive a pension of half of his or her existing salary for the rest of his or her life, along with a tax-free gratuity of one and a half times his or her salary.  People have to make their own choices.</p>
            <p eId="para_286">On the general issue, I accept that the current level of retirement is unprecedented.  Equally, there has been an unprecedented level of recruitment to the Garda Síochána.  The net figures for this year will show that Garda numbers are going up.  The McCarthy report did not indicate that there should be a reduction in Garda numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_287">I remind Deputy Rabbitte that his party colleague, Deputy Sherlock, recently said we cannot bury our heads in the sand.  He suggested that the Government should actively deal with the public sector wage bill.  He specifically referred to the need to examine allowances and practices within the HSE and the Garda.  The Labour Party is having it every way, to a certain extent.  It is complaining that there are not enough gardaí while Deputy Sherlock is making comments like those to which I have referred.  Equally, Fine Gael is calling for extra this and extra that at a time when Deputy Bruton is saying we should be curtailing expenditure.</p>

            <p eId="para_289">I am concerned that the Minister might have left the impression with senior gardaí in anticipation of retirement and indeed wider than that through the entire public sector that they might relax now and take the Minister's assurance as an assurance that the lump sum will only be taxed in excess of €200,000.  I would be concerned that the Minister would have an opportunity to clarify that because he could be the cause of a wave of complacency throughout the public service if they said that a senior Minister of such rigorous composure as the Minister Justice, Equality and Law Reform assures public servants that they will only be hit if the lump sum exceeds €200,000.  Perhaps the Minister might thank me for giving him the opportunity to make plain that that is not what he meant.  On the other hand if it is what he meant, it is fair that the public service and its unions should know it now.  It might be helpful in the context of the discussions going on with the Taoiseach and others at Government Buildings.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_325">We are now four weeks from the budget when the Government will attempt to put forward its choices in respect of bringing in €4 billion.  These choices are obviously difficult.  Owing to choices made in recent budgets we now find ourselves in an unprecedentedly serious situation.  In 2008 some 600,000 families received child benefit in respect of 1.1 million children.  These families are put to the pin of their collar to manage on a day-to-day basis and the money received from child benefit has become a central source of income for the vast majority of these families.  Last night I understand the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, obviously speaking on behalf of the Government, indicated that it is the intention of Government to cut child benefit in the budget four weeks from tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Budgets are about choices as the Taoiseach knows.  I want him to understand that the Fine Gael Party has accepted the broad principles of the figures he has mentioned.  We have looked at the situation that applies here.  I want the Taoiseach to know that it is my choice and our choice that we can achieve the savings that are required, and the reductions and adjustments to be made without touching child benefit.  I want to be absolutely clear on that.  There are thousands of families now heading towards negative equity and thousands of families where one job is gone or two jobs are gone as the case might be.  Hundreds of thousands of such families are under serious financial pressure on a daily basis.  Is it the intention of the Government to cut child benefit as proclaimed by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs last night?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_130">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_327">What the Minister for Social and Family Affairs pointed out last night in an effort to be helpful in a discussion that took place on an RTE programme was to the effect that, obviously, no decisions are yet taken but every area of public expenditure, including social welfare, must be looked at in the context of what contribution it can make towards making the €4 billion savings that must be made to stabilise the deficit.  Budgets cannot be about false choices.  Certainly there will be an opportunity in the pre-budget outlook debate that can take place here in coming weeks for parties to outline their positions as to how they would make up the €4 billion saving.  However, the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, was simply outlining the various options and issues being looked at in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">If we look at the child benefit situation, we have seen a trebling of child benefit for the first two children and an increase of more than 185% for the third child and subsequent children since 2001.  The cost of child benefit at the time was approximately €960 million and it is now approximately €2.5 billion.  The overall social welfare budget is more than €21 billion.  The total moneys coming into the Exchequer as of the end of October was €26 billion.  Clearly large areas of expenditure, including social welfare of course, cannot be immune from consideration when the Government decides what savings to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, was simply outlining that position and saying obviously that Government will make the decisions in due course.  What we are always trying to achieve of course is, in the context of any expenditure savings or adjustments that have to be made, to protect the least well off to the very best extent we can.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_330">I disagree with the Taoiseach.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs did not appear on a popular television programme merely to muse aloud in what has amounted to a cruel exploitation of hundreds of thousands of families who do not now know where they stand in regard to child benefit.  The Taoiseach is right that organisations and individuals deserve to know with clarity what lies ahead in respect of their economic circumstances.  The child benefit payment to more than 600,000 families in respect of 1 million children has been of direct income support to hundreds of thousands of those families.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs was either flying a kite or deliberately laying down a marker in what, as I said, has amounted to a cruel exploitation of families who do not now know where they stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">It seems to be acceptable to pump billions into banks and to allow people who borrowed enormous amounts of money to swan around as if they are untouchable by any law.  Yet people who find themselves in negative equity or who have lost a second or sole income are faced with a senior Minister implying that it is the Government's intention to cut child benefit.  The McCarthy report recommended that €500 million be saved from child benefit payments.  However, that amount could have been saved if the Government had accepted the Fine Gael recommendation of freezing public sector pay increments last year and this year.  The same amount could have been found if the percentage pay increase under the national wage agreement for this year and last year had not been applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I agree with the Taoiseach that there are no false choices.  We have looked closely at the circumstances we now face as a result of mismanagement by successive Governments in the last 12 years.  We are in a position now where hundreds of thousands of families are under pressure.  The Taoiseach's party in Government has, over a period of years, done down the worth of families and children by means of tax individualisation, slashing medical allowances, depriving children of educational facilities and so on.  Families have been done down in so many areas and there are now choices to be faced.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I wish to be clear in this regard — my party will achieve the savings that are required without touching child benefit.</p>

          <p eId="para_336">I have made the point to Deputy Kenny that total expenditure must be looked at in all aspects.  Decisions will be taken by the Government in due course in terms of whether there must be a reduction in the area of child benefit expenditure, which amounts to €2.5 billion, in a way that is as fair as possible given the varying degrees of household income to which it applies.  That is something that must be considered by the Government.  Where there are limited resources, one must target those resources to best effect and do so in as socially just a way as possible.  It is not easy given the scale of the issues before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">What is not being made clear in respect of Deputy Kenny's position is whether the social welfare budget will make any contribution towards the adjustment that is required.  I am sure plenty of people want to know the answer to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">The point is that it was indicated as far back as the April supplementary budget, as well as in the McCarthy report, that child benefit is an area of expenditure that must be examined.

There is a great discrepancy of income to which child benefit applies.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_348">There is no question that this is all about choices.  I must contrast the signal the Taoiseach is sending to the parents who are worried about what the Minister for Social and Family Affairs said last night — which is, in essence, that child benefit will now be targeted in the forthcoming budget — with the answer given by the Minister for Finance last week to Deputy Burton when she put to him a different type of choice that he might make.  I refer in particular to the treatment of the "golden ten" — the people who were loaned the money by Anglo Irish Bank to purchase shares in order to bail out the bank and bail out an even larger shareholder.  We are now stuck with the bulk of that loan, three quarters of which was on a non-recourse basis, that is, supported only by the value of the shares themselves, which are now worthless.  As a result, the taxpayer is stuck with a loss of some €300 million on that loan.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Deputy Burton pointed out to the Minister for Finance last week that not only are we stuck with the loss on the loan but that these people can write off the losses on the entire amount against their future capital gains tax liabilities.  She pointed out that this did not seem to be a good idea and asked the Minister for Finance if he would do something about it.  He replied that he had "no plans at this stage to make a change in this area", that "the current symmetry of treatment between losses and gains would be affected", and that this "would represent a significant change to our capital gains tax legislation".</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Such a change is very necessary.  We have a situation where the persons who borrowed this money and who contributed to the difficulties in the banking system will be able to claim tax relief on losses the taxpayer is already carrying while, on the other hand, the Government is telling parents to expect reductions in child benefit.  There is no similar arrangement for those unfortunate householders who are now in negative equity and who may have to sell their homes because they cannot pay the mortgage or because they have to emigrate.  They cannot write off losses against future tax liability as the "golden ten" are being allowed to do.  Does the Government seriously propose to do nothing to address this anomaly in the forthcoming budget?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_146">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_351">In regard to specific issues that arise regarding the banking situation, they will be dealt with on the basis that whatever debts are due and owing will have to be paid.  Mr. Appleby and others are looking at the corporate enforcement side of this.  The fact is that anything that is transferred does not exclude the liability people owe to financial institutions in respect of any debts they have.  That remains the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">A further issue has arisen today in regard to repossessions.  The idea has been put about that when the six or 12 months are up, depending on the financial institution in question, people will suddenly be subject to legal proceedings and with possible involuntary repossession of their homes imminent.  That is not what is envisaged.  A code of conduct has been agreed and the announcement today offers a further improvement on the situation.  People who engage and come to an arrangement with lenders on a six-monthly review basis can continue to maintain their position and keep their home.  That is something to which we all subscribe and expect in the context of a fair and equitable approach until the situation improves for those people.  It is important to point out that where there are arrears, arrangements are in place and the advice is for people to engage with their lenders and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  In regard to the previous matter, as I have said, the liability continues to be owed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_353">That was an answer to a question about house repossessions I asked the Taoiseach last week.  I asked whether the Government will do anything to close a tax loophole, which will cost the taxpayer approximately €80 million on top of the €300 million we are stuck with for the non-recourse element of the loans taken out by these people.  The issue is simple.  Ten people who belong to the golden circle borrowed this money, three quarters of it on a non-recourse basis, which means we are stuck with this and there is no question of it being repaid.  That is €300 million we are caught for as taxpayers.  On top of that, those involved will be able to write off the entire losses they make on this arrangement against future capital gains tax liability.  This is open-ended and they will be able to do so indefinitely.  This is a huge loophole in the arrangements governing capital gains tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Deputy Burton put it to the Minister for Finance that this loophole should be closed and he replied that he does not want to do so.  Before the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs or any other Minister comes into the House to tell us and the people that parents will have to take a cut in child benefit, pensioners may suffer a cut, the pay of State employees will be cut and God what knows else will be inflicted on people in the budget, will they not first close this loophole?  Why should there be one law for these people who are operating a sweetheart arrangement, which will result in a tax write-off for losses that are being borne by the taxpayer?  It is madness.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the plight of families who are prevented from cutting turf on their own bogs after centuries and who are now deprived access to this natural resource at a time of financial stress and increasing costs of alternative fuels.  Furthermore that an inquiry be held into suggestions that designated bogs have deteriorated by 35% in the past ten years which was not caused by ordinary people cutting turf for their own use and for which blame is attempted to be applied by disallowing the use of their own natural resource.</p>

Most low income families shop locally and many will be forced into the hands of unscrupulous moneylenders if the payment is not reinstated.  It is paramount the Government prioritises the needs of those who are already in financial difficulty at this time of year.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_384">The arrangement for the budget is already very tight.  It will be presented on 9 December, leaving only one sitting day in that week and one further week before the House rises for the Christmas.  Given the likely controversial nature of the social welfare Bill's contents, is it the Government's intention to dispose of the budget and also enact the social welfare Bill before Christmas?  It would not be acceptable to the Labour Party to have the budget and the social welfare Bill concertinaed together and dealt with before Christmas.  I hope the Government's thinking in this regard will be changed.  If it is not, we will have a very unChristmas-like atmosphere in the period immediately after the budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_385">I simply make the point that if the Bill includes changes which come into place on a certain date the legislation must be enacted before that date.  This is obvious.  If Deputy Gilmore is suggesting that issues of the scale facing us can be dealt with without reference to the €21 billion budget, I do not think that is fair either.</p>

The Minister added a section in the explanatory memorandum dealing with the opening of ducts in roads for telephone companies, telcos.  The Minister did not make provision for this in the Bill and he told the select committee that he would propose an amendment to this effect.  He sent us a copy of the amendment.  It emerged that he did not have Cabinet approval for the amendment.  To facilitate the progress of Committee Stage, Deputy Coveney and I have tabled the amendment in our names.  Did the amendment receive sanction at today's Cabinet meeting so that we can proceed tomorrow, because ironically our amendment has been ruled out of order as not germane to the Bill?</p>

As he said, both Bills completed Second Stage in the Seanad before the summer recess but since the publication of the Bills, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has received a large number of submissions from stakeholders and interested parties regarding provisions contained in both Bills.  Following receipt of those submissions, it has held consultations with the relevant stakeholders.  As I said earlier to Deputy Durkan, it is holding discussions with the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to preparing and drafting necessary Committee Stage amendments for both Bills.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">I refer to two Bills, one of which was raised by other Deputies.  Given the scope of the proposed cuts being bandied about, the changes to eligibility for various allowances under the social welfare code and the much discussed means testing for child benefit, does the Minister for Social and Family Affairs intend to amalgamate the social welfare Bill with the social welfare lone parents and other low incomes families reform Bill which is to provide for the introduction of a new means tested payment for lone parents and other families on low incomes and will replace the one-parent family payment?  The legislative programme states that it is not possible to indicate when that Bill will be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The social welfare Bill will make amendments to the social welfare code.  Is it proposed to amalgamate both Bills in order that we can discuss those changes in the context of the budget?  It seems the Minister suggested it will be before Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">At the time of the last budget the Minister for Finance announced that a number of agencies would be merged, including the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.  As Christmas approaches, I am concerned that the mark-up on goods imported from England, with the translation from sterling, is enormous.  For example, shoes which sell for €99 in chain-stores in Grafton Street, Dublin, cost £65 sterling in the UK.  The traders are now removing the UK price tag so that people are unable to make the translation of the extraordinary profit taking on the backs of Irish consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I understood the merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency would help to achieve some policy on fair prices for Irish consumers and stop this rip-off which is driving up costs in Ireland.  There are many Government task forces dealing with the economic situation.  Can the Taoiseach take any action with regard to progressing this legislation to at least ensure sterling and euro price tags are both shown so that people can see when they are being robbed blind by these, for the most part, British-based chain-stores?</p>

          <p eId="para_480">I thank the Members of the House for the interest they have taken in this legislation.  I am in agreement with a number of Deputies that given the diverse range of missions to which our Defence Forces make a positive contribution, it is vital the Defence Forces have the best protection and best equipment available when participating in peacekeeping missions overseas.  This legislation will enable further positive engagement in international peace support in humanitarian operations by facilitating access to research and information on developing and maintaining capabilities which we are unable to generate ourselves.  It is long recognised internationally that our troops have made an extremely valuable contribution to the operations in which they have been deployed.  The proposals in this Bill will allow us to decide on the enhancement of future capabilities available to the Defence Forces.  It is important to reiterate that any decisions on involving ourselves in European Defence Agency projects, or on participating in permanent structure co-operation, will remain the sole decision of the Irish Government and the Oireachtas.  The triple lock requirement in this Bill is consistent with the policy position of the Government in respect of the deployment of Defence Forces personnel on peacekeeping operations overseas.  I do not intend to depart from it and I know it is a position which is understood and appreciated by the Irish people.  It is reassuring that Deputies appreciate that where the European Defence Agency project will assist the enhancement of capabilities for an operation to which Ireland contributes troops, it is important to consider the benefits which Ireland can obtain from such participation.  While we may not be involved in specific projects, it is nevertheless essential that we are supportive of initiatives to improve capabilities available for overseas operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">In a climate of diminishing budgets, the House will agree there is a need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in spending.  The focus of the EDA in assisting member states in obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness and securing greater efficiency, will be particularly beneficial.  If involvement in the European Defence Agency projects will afford us an opportunity of achieving economies of scale in defence procurement, I would consider it particularly valuable from a defence expenditure perspective, especially in the current economic environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I reiterate my thanks to the Members of Dáil Éireann for taking this Bill at short notice.  I also wish to join with the kind sentiments expressed by various speakers on all sides of the House for the Defence Forces generally and in particular for service by the Defence Forces on overseas peace support missions.  Wherever they are, our troops serve with professionalism, dedication, courage and commitment.  Such service contributes extensively to the high regard in which Ireland is held within the international community.  In return, the safety and protection of troops must be one of our highest priorities and any means to support this should be considered positively.</p>

As expressed in the Lisbon debate, Ireland will not enter any arrangements without the approval of the Government and the Dáil.  The European Defence Agency is very important.  This Bill ensures our involvement in the EDA will guarantee compatible equipment and training for the Defence Forces.  It also provides the opportunity for interoperability, flexibility and the deployment of forces.  I refer to Ireland's participation in the EUFOR mission to Chad where similar equipment was made available to the Irish forces.  Training in the use of common equipment as between European armed forces is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I was not present in the Chamber for the Committee Stage of the Bill.

          <p eId="para_488">I realise that but this point could be made in the Seanad.  Perhaps an amendment could be tabled to the effect that in future if such an issue comes before the Dáil, the Seanad should be consulted to give it a meaningful role.  When the Minister goes before the Seanad he should consider extending the function of approval to the Seanad because we promote a bicameral approach involving both Houses.  Perhaps such an approach should apply in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">I refer to permanent structured co-operation.  The Minister stated he does not know exactly how this will work but that if he becomes involved he will revert to and consult with the House.  This is an assurance and safety procedure to the effect that we will not get involved in something that would interfere in any way with our neutrality or which would be against the wishes of the Dáil or the people.  I agree with the purpose of permanent structured co-operation.  I understand member states may come together for enhanced co-operation, for example, the provision of equipment such as helicopters, larger aircraft or more sophisticated weaponry that may not be available to smaller member states.  That is not the same as providing a European army but it will ensure some of the more difficult missions in which the European Union might participate in future will be properly equipped and that there will be proper movement of equipment.  As the Minister is aware, there was a problem in Chad with a medical evacuation.  In that case we received helicopters from the Ukraine that were not suitable.  Hopefully, enhanced co-operation will ensure this will not occur in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Overall, I welcome the legislation and the Minister will have support from Fine Gael.  I suggest when he goes before the Seanad, the Minister might include an amendment.  I would have tabled such an amendment but for other reasons I was not present during the debate.  The amendment should include a reference to the prior approval of the Oireachtas and it should include both Houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">On behalf of my colleague, Deputy Brian O'Shea, who is unavoidably absent due to illness, and on behalf of the Labour Party, I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this legislation.  During the referendum on the last Lisbon treaty we saw the problems generated by misinformation.  The introduction of this Bill is very positive and will help to alleviate those.  One never knows what clicks in the minds of people when they make decisions.  However, the fact that this was introduced in September and was in place before the treaty made all the difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I refer to other matters related to the Defence Forces.  This Bill will provide opportunities for many youngsters who join the Defence Forces to have access to modern equipment.  We are approaching Christmas time and I realise the Minister has provided guarantees to the House previously in respect of communications between people overseas and their families.  I trust such arrangements will be in place again this time.  As in the case of the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, I come from a constituency in which the Army plays a major part in the lives of so many people.  It is only true and fair to say that we hear very little but that the Army has carried out its duties in a first class way in respect of communications, which is to be commended.  We are approaching that time now and it is important such communication arrangements are put in place again.  As Deputy O'Shea stated previously, we fully support the Bill and I congratulate the Minister for moving when he did and I am sure a positive result will emerge and this will help to ensure the Defence Forces will continue to serve with such distinction and determination overseas.  This is a move for the better in respect of the Defences Forces.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">While I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, I am disappointed the Minister for Transport is not here this evening to deal with this very important Bill.  However, I have no doubts about the capability of the Minister of State to listen and to bring to the Department the views of this side of the House and how we believe the Bill could be made substantially better.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Last week I referred to the proposals of an bord snip nua to save €11 million at a very large cost to the rural population and well beyond any possible gain to the Exchequer.  To refer to saving €11 million is to overstate the case.  The actual funding is €8.9 million for the 37 groups involved.  However, in terms of value for money, it would be hard to outdo this scheme.  Apart from providing a door-to-door transport initiative, the services act as a warning mechanism within communities.  The drivers know all their passengers and are able to pass on details of elderly people who may have missed out on a journey into town, such that social services can check up on those people.  It is a very important community service and has been omitted from the Bill.  Bus drivers have a great rapport with their passengers, many of whom are starved of social interaction.  As someone who comes from Galway, the Minister of State will be aware of rural isolation and the devastating effects it can have on elderly people throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">With my colleagues, Councillors Sean Farrell and Michael Carrigy, and my brother, Councillor Larry Bannon, I had the honour of travelling on both routes in Longford and Westmeath during the recent day of protest, during which I met drivers and passengers.

          <p eId="para_499">There is a popular misconception that the rural transport scheme is solely directed at the elderly.  This is untrue, since the scheme is open to anyone living in a remote area who wishes to access local towns or villages.  For those under the age of 65 years, the cost of the return journey is €4 and a one-way journey costs €2.  There is currently a marked gender imbalance in the uptake of the service, with 80% of the passengers being female.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">School busses sit idle between delivery and collection and they could be utilised to extend the rural transport fleet.  This has been talked about for some time but nothing has taken place in this regard.  As the buses in the scheme collect and return passengers to their homes, the fleet should be comprised of smaller buses which could carry between 14 and 22 passengers and better navigate country lanes.  However an extension of the scheme could see larger buses being used to pick up those who are able to access collection points on main routes and so forth.  It would be a major mistake to link the extension of the rural transport scheme to the new drink driving laws.  This is happening in Fianna Fáil, particularly with promises made at parliamentary party meetings.  Fianna Fáil cannot keep the proceedings of those meetings in complete secrecy.  There are leaks.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_502">Drinking and socialising in country areas is an issue because it is becoming more and more restricted.  The rural bus scheme is primarily a daytime scheme, providing access to banks, post offices, hospitals, chemists and retail outlets.  It is obvious that Mr. McCarthy never lived in isolation in rural Ireland or he would not have threatened a vital lifeline for those who do.  I hope he will have a change of thought on this matter and I hope the Government does not implement the McCarthy proposals in full.  If it does, it will be to the detriment of rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">The valuable work carried out by enthusiastic and hard-working Pobal staff, community resources centre staff and community transport co-ordinators has gone a long way to improving the situation of rural bus passengers.  Rather than see the work stalled or restricted, the Government must prioritise rural transport in the forthcoming budget.  On behalf of all those availing of the service who live in rural areas and do not have transport of their own, I plead with the Minister to ensure that it happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The midlands has been consistently overlooked in terms of infrastructure and vital transport links.  The midlands was excluded from Transport 21 despite the great hullabaloo at the launch.  It is becoming unbelievably repetitive to speak in this House about broken Government promises.  The numbers of times I have addressed this is becoming legendary.  The Minister should remember that reneging on promises, such as the retention and extension of the rural transport scheme, will leave many disgruntled communities and people.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The Public Transport Regulation Bill purports to put bus passengers' needs at the centre of bus route licensing.  With the Dublin Transport Authority due to be renamed the national transport authority, the failure of the Minister to include rural areas is mystifying, but perhaps not.  Despite its inclusive national title, the Bill has been described as good news for Dublin commuters because it prioritises the needs of bus passengers in the capital when issuing licences for bus routes.  When will there be good news about public transport infrastructure for rural Ireland under this Government?  Rural Ireland does not have the benefit of the Luas system.  It does not have an equivalent of the DART.  It is hard to say what transport it has.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">On repeated occasions I have spoken on the Adjournment about the reopening of Killucan and Multyfarnham stations in County Westmeath.  Studies have shown that hundreds of people would access these stations if they were up and running.  With the rising costs of motoring, the large toll cost on the M4, the two-hour delay getting to Dublin by road and the need to cut back on carbon emissions, the people of Killucan, Kinnegad, Multyfarnham and surrounding areas have a right of access to a station in the immediate vicinity.  Despite this logic and the lack of transport infrastructure in the midlands, the Minister failed to consider these options.  They were not included in Transport 21.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The people of Longford are also victims of under-provision of rail transport, being at the mercy of the Dublin-Sligo train.  This is a major health and safety hazard on Sunday evenings.  I highlighted this last Thursday when the Minister for Transport attended the House during Question Time.  People are packed like sardines and a seat is out of the question for most.  This happens as far back as Edgeworthstown where the train becomes full.  That is some 100 km from passengers' destination in the capital city.  I would like the Minister to examine this because it is a major health and safety issue.  After a catastrophe or a serious accident is not the time for the Department or the Minister to take action.  I have flagged this matter this evening and I hope the Minister takes note.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The development of the rail link between Mullingar and Athlone was also shamefully omitted from the Transport 21 programme.  This vital infrastructural provision is essential to the economic development of the midlands.  In order to increase inward investment in the region, rail transport is an import link in the chain.  The midlands has some of the most dangerous roads in the country.  This was highlighted by an AA report some time ago.  Some of the roads in the midlands are known as the roads to hell.  It also has the worst rail provision.  In order for a constituent of mine to get to Cork by train, he must either travel to Portlaoise or Dublin.  It is the same case if one wants to get to Belfast from Longford, Mullingar or Athlone.  One must travel to Dublin first.  What incentive is this to foreign investment or business expansion in the midlands?</p>
          <p eId="para_509">The Government must urgently consider the possibility of providing a central rail link.  I have highlighted this matter over the years at regional authority meetings when I served on such bodies.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">I raised the possibility of providing a central rail link, linking towns in the midlands such as Athlone, Mullingar, Longford, Portlaoise, Roscommon, Cavan and Edgeworthstown.  There could be spurs off this central line.  It would improve the rail infrastructure for the entire midlands area.  In addition to joining up Athlone to Mullingar, the central line would be of great benefit to schools and young people from the midlands accessing the Athlone Institute of technology.  Longford and Westmeath have historically been poorly served in terms of rail links to the north of the country.  I would like to see something happening to improve the lot of the people in the midlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">While fully supporting the principle of one regulatory body for public transport in Ireland, Fine Gael opposes this Bill because it maintains a veil of protection around CIE.  It does not offer any real competition in the Irish bus market.  It does very little to look after the interests of people living in rural Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">I will wind up now.  The proposed new licensing system states that Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Irish Rail are not subject to the new system as they come under the direct award contract.  The Bill also allows the new national transport authority to renew contracts under direct award without being subject to the tendering process.  This is unfair and no matter where one goes in Europe, one sees better public transport systems than in Ireland.  Some of the eastern European countries that joined the EU in recent times, such as Slovakia and Slovenia, have better links with towns and villages than Ireland.  We could take a leaf out of their book if we travelled to these countries, examined the fine transport infrastructure and adopted it in Ireland.  We should try to get a better system of transport running up and down this country.  Any industry that seeks to set up business in this country will note that this is absent.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">We have very poor transport infrastructure and I do not see any great hope for improvement under Fianna Fáil or the Green Party.  Since coming into office, the Green Party has provided cycle lanes and filled the pot holes in the cycle lanes, but no major transport infrastructure is being developed under its watch.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_520">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on Second Stage of the Public Transport Regulation Bill 2009.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide a good quality cost-efficient public bus passenger transport service for the people of the country.  To effect that vision, the Government believes there is a need to examine the licensing regime that exists and examining it clearly shows a necessity to reform it.  The Bill sets out the framework to facilitate regulated competition in the public bus passenger service.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Despite what the previous speaker, Deputy James Bannon, stated, the Bill builds upon knowledge and experience gained from other jurisdictions which sought to liberalise the market.  I was taken by the comments he made and by the position put forward by Fine Gael which seems to involve liberalisation or absolute deregulation in the bus market.  Other jurisdictions have done that, believing that open competition in a full and open market would lead to better value and perhaps a better service for the consumer.  My understanding from the research I have done is that this theory has been proved wrong.  The approach taken by the Government will lead to a much better outcome than those achieved elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Fine Gael has put forward proposals which seek to mirror the approach taken by the UK.  Its experience of deregulation and tendering has generated very negative comments.  I received material on a study undertaken by the Office of Fair Trading in the UK.  The initial report outlined some worrying trends which undermine much of what Deputy Bannon said about deregulation or open tendering.  It sounds good but the experience has not been to the benefit of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The material I received seems to indicate that deregulation resulted in reduced or, in some cases, no competition resulting in lower quality services.  It was found that in areas with only one operator fares are typically 9% higher.  This would be worrying from a consumer's point of view.  The term "gaming" was used in the report, and this was identified as a practice where an operator could cut rural or less profitable ends from a commercial route with the expectation that ultimately the UK local authority would have to tender that element of the route to an operator who could then operate it as part of a subsidised route.  This means that what was all under a commercial licence initially would end up receiving further financial support from the state at a greater cost to the state.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">I understand the initial report of the Office of Fair Trading refers to the Darlington case where a multinational company submitted a bid to buy a local municipal bus company, the Darlington Transport Company.  It was unsuccessful in that effort and immediately flooded the market with free buses.  The municipal bus company could not compete and went bust within a number of days.  The local councils lost out because they had a facility and service with an inherent value of in excess of €1 million.  Due to a deregulated environment, the financial resources available to a multinational company were able to put a company out of business.  This shows that deregulation does not work.  The predatory practices of large multinationals will wipe out any competition in a short period of time and ultimately control the market to suit themselves and make a profit.  It requires greater thinking.  I am somewhat concerned about elements of the Bill but, by and large, its structure and framework are right and some areas might be tightened up through amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The Office of Fair Trading's study dealt with tendering, which happens outside London.  There was a near doubling in the cost to the taxpayer over the past ten years with a cost today of £1 per kilometre.  In half of all local areas outside of London, 20% of tenders receive just one bid.  This sets out the basis for the information gleaned by the Minister and the Department which shows the importance of retaining to some extent a regulated environment for liberalisation in a regulated way.  While the two words might seem somewhat confusing, it is important that we take that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Bus Éireann provides a very good service throughout Ireland and there is a quality to that service.  It provides value for money and its cost structures were recognised by Deloitte in its most recent report as being to a very high standard.  That was based on independent research.  To seem to undermine — as Deputy Bannon did perhaps inadvertently — what Bus Éireann does is wrong and unfair to the people who work in that service.  They carry out their work in a very efficient way and that is down to the management of Bus Éireann, particularly people such as Tim Hayes, whom I believe to be an excellent public servant.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">At present, there is much criticism of public and civil servants orchestrated by some elements of the media.  When one makes an effort through research to understand what is going on in many State and semi-State companies, one meets people of the calibre of Tim Hayes, John Lynch and others on the board of CIE who give it their all; they have the common good of people at heart.  These people are often undermined by the unnecessary commentary that goes on in this House in seeking to gain political advantage and outside the House by elements of the media.  It is right that we recognise where public servants have put in place a service that has been to the benefit of all and, it is hoped, can be maintained, worked upon and built upon through the passage of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The integrated nature of the Bus Éireann network is a vital component of the service provided.  It offers a vital link throughout rural and more urbanised areas.  The current service is not, and was never intended to be, a rural service.  A recent development, whereby the Government put aside funding through the rural transport initiative, is a way of dealing with that.  I will address this later if I have an opportunity to do so.  It is important that we focus on the integrated nature of the service as it is constructed because it is open to larger multinationals to cherry pick commercial routes.  The multinationals will exploit some point-to-point routes and generate as much business on them as they can and seek to generate profits for themselves.  The existing service facilitates some PSO or subvented work as a part of or at the tail end of some routes.  We need to examine this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">As the Government rolls out the interurban routes, which will connect Cork, Limerick and Galway with Dublin, we must ensure that a service is maintained along what were the old routes.  The new services will go point-to-point and carry the greatest number of passengers but it is important that those towns which are bypassed — some of them are quite large — still have an effective transport service.  We must be careful in the issuing of licences by the transport authority at a later stage that, in an effort to offer a point-to-point service, we do not undermine the existing service.  Deputy Bannon spoke much about Athlone and other places in his constituency.  The simple reality is that if we were to deregulate the market, the bulk of people from Galway, Sligo and other locations would take the main routes and there would not be the business to allow a service provider to call to the villages and towns he discussed.  What he is asking for would be to the detriment of many of the towns in his constituency.  We must be very careful about this and it needs to be taken into account in the issuing of licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">In an effort to address that, the State would have to provide more money for routes which would start to carry public service obligations after the removal of commercial services along interurban routes.  I am aware that a large multinational company has begun to provide an unlicensed service on the Dublin-Galway route in an effort to put an indigenous provider out of business.  The financial resources of this multinational allows it to offer €1 fares.  Such companies will be able to push the indigenous operators off routes very easily.  They have sought to undermine the existing regime because the 1932 Act fails to provide the sanctions required to deal with them.  The framework set out in the Bill before us will, however, allow the State to act.  I ask the Minister to ensure the issuance of a licence does not impact on the integrated network.  The licensing of routes which have a commercial basis alongside PSO components by virtue of the way Bus Éireann has operated in the past should not be done in such a way as to require the State to pick up the cost of the PSO.  I ask the Minister to consider strengthening the legislation to protect the network.  Perhaps he could consider excluding those who have previously operated in an unlicensed or predatory manner from receiving future licences.  I accept this would be difficult to achieve because companies can change names and directors but it is not beyond the Minister and his officials to come up with a method for excluding directors or operators.  Some operators, including in particular the multinationals, recognise the landscape is changing and have sought to soften up the marketplace in advance.  We need to get tough by ensuring they do not achieve their aims.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">As somebody from a rural area, I am cognisant of the difficulties experienced by those who live in isolated areas.  In areas with aging populations, there are people who do not have access to private transport or relatives.  It is vital, therefore, that the State manages a rural transport service.  While the Bill before us does not deal with that issue, I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister that funding will continue to be made available for the rural transport initiative.  However, we will have to await the budget for the details of that funding.  Although rural transport was identified in the McCarthy report as an area in which cuts could be made, I am delighted that the Government in its wisdom has decided to protect that service.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The Clare accessible transport project, which originated in the part of east Clare from which I come, has developed a great service for people in isolated rural areas.  It has already been working on the pilot projects identified by the Minister which bring together the HSE, Bus Éireann and the rural transport initiative to develop a more comprehensive approach to the movement of people in rural areas.  We owe the project our gratitude for targeting the most important groups, namely, the elderly, the young and the disabled.  An inherent part of its work is ensuring that young and elderly people with disabilities can access bus services.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Rural transport needs to move beyond initiatives and pilot projects and into the mainstream public transport network.  The outcome of the pilot projects and other research can facilitate the State in introducing a comprehensive rural transport network which is integrated into national bus and rail routes so that people living in Mountshannon, Killanena, Feakle or Corofin have the same access to transport as those in Athlone or Dundalk.  The frequency of service may not be the same but at least people would have access to the outside world.  Rural transport services would also contribute to decreasing carbon emissions by reducing the necessity for cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Rural transport becomes even more critical in the context of the Government's plans to reduce the blood-alcohol limit as part of its road safety agenda.  While there are differing views on these plans, the Government intends to progress them.  A proper bus network will be necessary if people who live in rural Ireland are to have the same social opportunities as those who live in larger towns and cities.  To that end, I hope the rural transport initiative is put on a legislative footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I ask that further consideration be given to the issues I have raised.  Strengthening the conditions on which licences are issued can protect the PSO components of the network from practices which could otherwise lead to the deterioration of services or require greater investment by the State.  I also ask that the legislation be strengthened in respect of operators.  I suggest that we investigate whether licence applicants have criminal records, particularly in regard to drug or child offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">It is necessary that the financial stability and integrated network of the direct award contract of Bus Éireann's PSO services should be considered when granting all categories of licences.  Licences should not be issued if they cut across PSO services.  Otherwise, the State will bear the costs of supporting the services in question or will be forced to close them and, possibly, reinstate them at further cost to the State at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Those who have sought to undermine the current licensing regime should be dealt with appropriately and effectively.  While this is not possible under current legislation, they could be dealt with when they seek a licence under the new regime.  Their past practices should come back to haunt them because they have inflicted damage on the bus network.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneMcEntee" eId="spk_276">
          <from>Deputy Shane McEntee</from>
          <p eId="para_538">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue of transport.  Deputy Dooley should note that Deputy Bannon did not seek to undermine Bus Éireann or CIE.  Many transport-related issues provide a road to economic recovery.  lreland is a small country and relatively new State.  Rather than go abroad this year, I travelled the length and breadth of the country.  During my travels, I observed the significant work done in improving the road network in the past ten or 15 years, particularly around the major towns.  Irrespective of the contribution made by individual counties to the economy, whether in agriculture or through other activities, all of them have a transport infrastructure on which they can build.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The Government must show foresight by continuing to invest in transport to assist economic recovery.  In recent weeks, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, expressed delight that Dublin's car parks were not full.  Perhaps he believes this is the outcome of some Green Party initiative to persuade people to use bicycles or buses.  As Deputies will have noted, however, buses are no longer full.  Someone should inform the Minister that the reason our buses and car parks are not full is that 400,000 people are staying at home.  We must address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">As a rural Deputy, I am aware that members of the two main parties have played the rural isolation card in recent debates on drink driving.  Isolation affects those living in towns as much as those in rural areas.  I had the privilege of living in a town.  If one has no contact with one's neighbours, there is no more lonely place to live than in a town.  In the country people can ask a neighbour to give them a lift whereas people in towns will find themselves stuck for a lift.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Transport must be provided in every corner of the country but State money cannot be pumped into loss-making services.  I have been a member of the Joint Committee on Transport for four or five years.  The joint committee has had some good meetings with Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann, Aer Lingus and other transport companies.  During the boom times, providers of bus services opened new bus routes.  At our meetings, however, they told the joint committee that they would close them if they did not make money.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">While Bus Éireann, like Aer Lingus, is an established Irish brand, this does not mean that one can continue to throw money at these companies.  Earlier today, we met representatives of Aer Lingus pilots.  A couple of weeks ago, when representatives of Aer Lingus outlined the company's plans at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport they failed to inform members of plans to establish a new company in England which will employ contract workers at the expense of Irish workers.  As all the available figures show, Aer Lingus, Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann and other transport companies have a viable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The Minister must take responsibility for all aspects of transport.  He cannot continue to pass the buck by arguing that the National Roads Authority, CIE and other bodies are not his responsibility.  He must take responsibility for the money allocated to transport and ensure the best possible services are provided, regardless of whether one lives in a town or city or on Achill Island.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">The population of the State is predicted to increase from approximately 4.25 million to 6.5 million in the next 30 or 40 years as a result of the baby boom.  Figures also show that we do not have sufficient university or school places to accommodate the 10,000 additional students who will complete school annually over the next ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Transport services must be able to pay for themselves.  If we must create competition to achieve this, so be it.  I am not a businessman but it is clear one cannot continue to throw borrowed money into a system that is not paying for itself.  The companies involved, whether CIE companies or private bus firms, know this practice cannot continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The transport companies are responsible and helpful.  They return one's calls and respond to queries, even if their responses are not to our liking.  I do not have any complaints in that regard and Deputy Bannon did not try to undermine them in any respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Before the property boom, the economy was driven by exports.  Companies considering locating in Ireland found that while the greater Dublin area had good transport infrastructure, road standards were not good in counties such as Leitrim and Mayo or even north County Meath.  The position has since changed for the better.  We must maintain the road infrastructure developed in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The M3 was a major issue when I was first elected four or five years ago.  While the road will be built, I am not sure many people will use it because fewer people commute to Dublin.  It is, nevertheless, a great investment.  We must build new factories and create jobs for our young people, rather than export them to the United States, Australia and elsewhere.  We must build factories near the major roads to Cork, Galway and Belfast and stop building up our cities.  Whereas in the past, it could take four or five hours to travel from one of our airports to one's destination, we now have good road links from our airports.  We must ensure some areas are not left isolated and stop driving investment to the east coast.  With the island at peace, we must also develop greater links with the North and become more competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">I am the Fine Gael Party spokesperson on road safety.  My county has experienced several serious accidents involving buses in recent years.  In terms of introducing Bills, we have missed golden opportunities, particularly in regard to drink driving, to have safer roads.  Some three or four years ago we had the second or third worst road safety record in Europe.  It is an area in which I am lucky to be involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">One can play politics with this area or with peoples' lives.  Noel Brett and Gay Byrne were appointed four or five years ago to do something about the carnage which was taking place on our roads.  A lot has happened and we have jumped from being second or third worst in Europe in terms of road fatalities to sixth worst.  I have no doubt, if everything goes according to plan, that we will be near the top when new figures come out.  However, many lives are still being lost on our roads and the introduction of the new drink driving measures, which is causing controversy in every party and which has resulted in lobbying from various groups, is worth it if one life is saved.  We need to address some of the issues rural Deputies have referred to regarding transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">On road safety, whereas we have risen to the top in regard to the number of deaths per head of population, we have slipped down to second worst in terms of road deaths suffered by those walking on our roads.  Some 71% of all road deaths take place in rural Ireland, whereby many people walking on our roads have died because there are no facilities in place to transport people home safely at night.  The taxi system in rural Ireland has broken down.  One can only get a taxi from Saturday night until 6 p.m. on Sunday.  There is little or no service outside those times.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, had a golden opportunity to address all the issues regarding road safety in his new Bill.  In referring to it I am not going off the mark.  Speed is a massive issue and some 40% of road deaths are due to speed.  Some 30% of people are killed as a result of road conditions and 24% are killed due to drink and drug driving.  If the new laws are introduced and gardaí receive new equipment that figure will probably rise to 26%.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Speed cameras were supposed to be introduced.  I do not now what is the current position but, looking at what has happened in England and other countries, they will be outdated when they are introduced.  The introduction of fixed speed cameras is not working in other countries.  As road safety spokesperson I intend to examine that issue in my own county, which is no worse than anywhere else.  All the fixed speed cameras in place in my county are burned out as a result of people dropping fire-bombs into them.  This situation will continue because one cannot continue to police them.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Mobile speed units, the location of which people are unsure, are becoming more effective.  The Minister is dallying in terms of addressing the speed camera issue.  There is a problem between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, but more people will die on our roads because of a lack of prevention in consequence of gardaí not being given speed cameras or whatever.  On the argument between the different parties in the Dáil over the last weeks and the lobbying which is taking place regarding the drink driving laws, there should be a full and open debate on what is happening in Ireland in regard to drink driving and whether the proposed law on reducing the limit from 80 mg to 50 mg will isolate people.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Those arguments are nonsense.  Problems in rural Ireland in terms of pubs, shops and everything else are a result of prices and people not having money.  A transport system in a parish or an area is the way forward.  One hears people saying that a special VRT rate for a publican is a good idea but it is not.  One cannot have a man standing behind a bar and then driving a bus home.  One could examine the idea of having a carrier within each parish which could provide services throughout the day.  Deputies Bannon and Dooley referred to the fact that people want to go to the post office, shop or pub.  The same situation pertains in towns.  One can now only get taxis at certain times of the day because taxi drivers cannot earn a living when they are all in the one place at the one time and there is no movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">We have covered good ground and a lot of money was spent on our roads during the boom years.  The different bus operators have tried new routes and are now beginning to realise money is not coming in and they have to stop the services.  As Deputy Dooley correctly said, Bus Éireann has recognised routes which have been in place for years but there may only be two or three people on buses.  One cannot continue to pump money into and protect such an industry.  One cannot run a bus from Carrickmacross to Kingscourt, Nobber, Navan and Dublin with three or four people on it.  It does not make sense, even though it might look good and one can say the service is there.  We all know cuts are necessary and we cannot continue to put money into such a system.  There is nothing wrong with the Fine Gael idea that there should be competition.  We have to look at the possibility of opening up the industry and see what happens over time.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">I come from a small village in Nobber and some 35 years ago two thirds of our football team came to Dublin.  If we depended on a single Bus Éireann bus such people would never get to training or matches.  One had different buses which ran at different times, a system which worked quite well.  With costs such as insurance it is difficult to run any business, but one cannot have an industry where one half is supported while the other is not because the result will be similar to what happened to supermarkets, many of which have closed down.  That is something for which the Government is responsible.  We have ended up with a system where all the small shops, post offices and Garda stations in rural Ireland are closing down.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Many thousands of jobs can be created in the transport system, but only if a Minister does not give an answer when a question is asked regarding the NRA, CIE or Iarnród Éireann which states, "It is not my business".  That day is gone.  It is his business because when a new link is opened in Dunboyne or a new part of the M3 is opened the Minister is there to open it.  One must have a Minister who takes responsibility for all the different avenues of transport.  He has to take full responsibility for the moneys which go into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Every Deputy in this House gets the same representations.  This country is at a complete standstill in regard to cash flow and not a cent is being given to any small business.  We discuss child benefit, which is a lifeline to families.  One cannot continue to tax people.  In this context, 99% of the children's allowance will be spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">We need responsibility rather than more tax cuts.  We need Ministers to stand up and be responsible for their Departments.  I did not like the meeting I had with Aer Lingus pilots today and we must make a stand on the issue.  The State owns 25% of Aer Lingus and the workers have put €40,000 and €50,000 of their own money into it.  Now we have brought in a few people who feel it is okay to form another company in England and put out to contract Irish people's jobs to those from abroad.  That comes under the remit of the Department of Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Every job involved with transport or even the building of our roads and railroads is one of the greatest possible investments for this country, along with education.  The Government should no longer pump money into a black hole and should instead open the process.  If the Government wants to borrow billions of euro to keep the banks running — I know we need them but they are getting too much — it should borrow an extra couple of billion to continue building roads and railways.  In that way we will keep people employed and safe on our roads.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_563">With the permission of the House I would like to share with Deputy Nolan.  I welcome the Minister's speech and in response to Deputy McEntee, I look forward to meeting the Aer Lingus pilots tomorrow.  I have the same concerns as the Deputy about Aer Lingus staff in Shannon, as the proportion of proposed cuts to be imposed there is too high.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I am happy with this Bill, which deals with the licensing of the commercial public bus transport service.  That is very important at a time when we see many people in this business who are unlicensed, and where there are insufficient penalties or deterrents for people going into it and putting legitimate operators out of business.  I welcome the Minister's actions, particularly in section 10 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">I was concerned when the Minister spoke of bringing in arrangements which already apply in the greater Dublin area, as it was the be all and end all and the answer to our problems.  That is not the case and Dublin Bus has not always been a great example of the way we should be going.  There is a need for a great shake-up in Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, to which I will refer later.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">The point made about introducing contracts for non-commercial services is very important.  I come from a county with an excellent service if a person lives in Galway city or along the main routes, with buses on the hour and half-hour.  There is great competition between the private operators and Bus Éireann.  However, there is an area in north-east Galway where buses, especially those from Bus Éireann, operated in the past but that service is no longer available.  That is a great pity and I would like those services to be replaced by a proper service.  We now have services to Dublin Airport as well, which are very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">I appeal to all the people in the bus transport business, be they Bus Éireann or private operators, to try always to be on time.  There are complaints about buses not meeting their timetables, which leads to people not getting to the airport on time or missing hospital or business appointments.  There is an obligation on a company when it gets a licence to apply all the conditions of that licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The primary purpose of the Bill is to replace the Road Transport Act 1932, which I welcome.  The objectives of the legislation are to promote regulated competition in the provision of licensed public bus passenger services on a national basis in the public interest.  We want this to be cost-efficient and functioning well because it is essential to a modern society.  Other Deputies have referred to the question of competition, which is very important because we are investing much money under Transport 21.  We must ensure that there is competition and that there is a level playing field.  I would like to see that being stressed by the Minister and the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">We want a level playing field where both the private operators and Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann operate under the same rules.  This has been sought for a long time by people who provide transport.  The question of equity of access to the transport market was a commitment under the agreed programme for Government.  I should also mention that under this programme there was a reference to the rural transport scheme, and I am glad it was included.  It is now available in every county in Ireland, and I would like to see this very good service developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Some people have spoken about the use of rural transport as a means to visit public houses.  There was an effort by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, to link that service to public houses and it was the subject of much ridicule.  They were called "booze cruises" or some other derogatory term.  There is probably another way of dealing with the issue and there may be a role for the people who own or run public houses.  It is good to see that rural transport is in the programme and all credit is due to the two parties in Government for putting that together.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The bus is very important in rural Ireland.  As I come from a rural area I know that we cannot speak about rail services in these areas.  I was pleased to note that the agreed programme for Government included a reference to the way bus licences are given out and that we want a transparent, faster and more integrated system for granting them.  The programme also seeks efficient and effective utilisation of the existing fleet.  There has been some duplication of services and I would like to see some of this eliminated.  I have already mentioned bus departures and the reliability of services, which are very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The Minister has shown his commitment to the question of the railways and we are very glad to see the western rail corridor extend from Limerick to Ennis.  It will go to Athenry before the end of this year.  I hope the Minister will be in Athenry in the next few weeks or before the end of the year to launch the next phase of the corridor officially.  The service going from Athenry to Galway and Limerick will be particularly welcome, and the next phase will bring the service to Tuam, Mayo and the north west.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I have followed this commitment for over 30 years as I worked with Fr. McGrail and people like him on the western inter-county rail committee.  I am glad that the Minister has shown his commitment in this regard.  I also mention a former Minister, the late Séamus Brennan, who was so supportive in getting the rail corridor progressed along the western seaboard.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The Bill establishes a very clear structure and it will be the basis of applications for bus route licences.  Section 10 is at the heart of this process and will help to give genuine people a licence to operate.  It will also introduce realistic penalties for those who do not have a proper licence or are operating without one.  This is a welcome and overdue provision.  It is essential to ensure that participants in the market are protected from illegal operators who, in the past, took advantage of the lack of sufficient penalties to gain market advantage and put other operators out of business.  Now that there will be increased financial penalties and clear powers for revoking licences when people do not meet the conditions under which licences are granted, we will be able to offer more protection to service providers and the public.  If a service provider fails to continue to meet the basic requirements of the road transport operators licence, which sets the standards for access to the profession, his or her route licence under this legislation will be automatically revoked.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The Bill has been drafted to give the renamed National Transport Authority the maximum latitude in relation to bus licensing, through the making of guidelines.  The section headings are indicative of the Bill's deliberately non-prescriptive nature, in the sense that their purpose is to establish a legislative framework against which applications will be considered.  The bus licensing guidelines under section 23 will be pivotal in setting out the criteria the authority proposes to apply to the consideration of applications for the granting of licences.  The guidelines may refer to matters relating to applications for the granting, renewal, transfer or amendment of licences, including the time taken by the authority to reach a decision on these matters.  In light of the importance and impact of the guidelines, the authority will be required to consult the Minister for Transport and the Competition Authority and to publish a draft of its proposals before it finalises the guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I welcome these provisions because they will open the market for future public obligation services and facilitate contracts that will ensure the continuation of the provision of existing transport services to the travelling public.  I hope this Bill, which I strongly support, is enacted speedily with the co-operation of the Members of this House.</p>

        <!--Fix-->
        <speech by="#MJNolan" eId="spk_279">
          <from>Deputy M. J. Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_577">It is timely that this legislation has been introduced after 77 years to bring greater clarity and fairness to the bus route licensing system.  Deputies on all sides of the House will welcome the fact that we are bringing the public bus licensing regime up to date.  Serious criticisms of the system that has been in place up to now have been made by the operators of private bus routes, in particular.  I hope the Bill before the House, which will facilitate the much needed reform of the licensing system by establishing a National Transport Authority, will have a speedy passage through the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">I would like to comment on the history of transport in Ireland.  It has been very difficult to put an integrated ticketing system in place in Dublin.  I hope that the National Transport Authority will work far more quickly than some of its predecessors.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">More thought has to be put into the use of our public transport fleet.  Hundreds of school buses lie idle for the main part of the day.  Many of the school bus operators that are contracted to Bus Éireann to provide school bus services are able to use a little imagination to organise two or three school runs each morning and evening.  I do not understand why CIE, which has millions of euro tied up in its school bus fleet, cannot make better use of that fleet, particularly in rural areas where communities are crying out for a public transport system.  It is not right that public buses wait in farmers' yards throughout the day before they are used again to collect school children in the evening.  It would be welcome if the new National Transport Authority were to focus a little of its attention on seeing how better use can be made of our substantial investment in school buses.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Ireland was a different country when the Road Transport Act 1932 was originally drawn up.  At that time, one could not travel from Sligo, Galway, Cork, Shannon or Waterford to Dublin other than by car or by rail.  Nowadays, there are daily flights from such centres of population to Dublin.  I commend the Government and its predecessors on the welcome investment of billions of euro in our road infrastructure, which has led to significant improvements in the country's road network.  The public transport network has also improved, for example by means of the upgrading of buses to luxury coaches for the purpose of bringing people between our towns and cities.  I hope the new National Transport Authority will examine the gap in the system that causes rural communities to feel left out of such investment.  I encourage it to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">I listened to Opposition speakers talking about Aer Lingus.  I agree that the Government will have to address a definite problem in that regard.  As Aer Lingus is part-owned by the State, there is an onus on the Government to consider seriously the problems being encountered by our national airline.  Although it has been privatised, we continue to have a serious responsibility to maintain our national flag carrier.  We should be seen to be interested in ensuring that it continues to operate as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, which was passed by the Oireachtas last year, will be incorporated in the Bill before the House.  Therefore, the new authority will be responsible for the regulation and control of all public passenger transport in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">We are aware that airline pilots assume significant responsibilities when they transport passengers across the skies.  I may have missed a reference in this legislation to the similar responsibilities of bus drivers, who take charge of 45, 50 or 60 people on each bus.  We are familiar with the health regulations that apply to pilots, who have to undergo stringent annual or biannual medical tests.  The same criteria should apply to bus drivers, particularly in light of the questions that have been asked about the health and medical condition of bus drivers who have been involved in serious accidents.  We have a responsibility to ensure that those who travel on coaches are in safe hands.  I do not know much about the criteria that Iarnród Éireann applies to the medical examinations of train drivers, but I expect that they are serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a system for the licensing of commercial public bus passenger services.  We are familiar with the success of private bus operators.  There has been a huge increase in the number of bus operators who are successfully serving the inter-city route between Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow and Dublin.  I know from my constituency that there is an hourly service from Carlow to Dublin and on to Dublin Airport. The Dublin Airport Authority has a lot to answer for because many people find it more cost-effective to travel to the airport by bus than to pay the exorbitant car parking prices charged by the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">We have to learn from the public transport experiences of other countries.  I accept that population plays a large part in ensuring that certain routes need to be subvented.  In Carlow town, we had a local service where a bus operator had a subvention for the provision of public transport in the town.  Unfortunately it was not cost effective and even though the town council made a significant contribution towards its subvention, the use by the public was insufficient.  This brings me back to the use of school transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I support the legislation.  Given that we have infrastructure in place between rail, road and a fleet of buses in the ownership of the State, we should get better use of it.  I hope the new authority will look seriously at getting better use for the resources we have put in place.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_587">I am not opposed to the concept of having Údarás Náisiúnta Iompair.  I do not agree with the concept or ideology behind much of what is contained in the Bill given that its intention is to allow for the privatisation of public transport networks and companies.  Section 20(1) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_588">Public bus passenger services being provided by Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus [which is the wrong title because the company's title is Bus Átha Cliath] on the day of the commencement of this section ... may continue to operate until such time, not being longer than 2 years after that day, as the Authority grants a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Basically within two years all the services of Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath will be open to competition and therefore open to privatisation.  The concept of having a national transport authority is welcome given the way Ireland has grown and the need to have all the various public transport services integrated to ensure proper planning happens.  We have heard from other Deputies about the failure of planning.  We are still awaiting a proper public transport network to Navan.  I heard Deputy McEntee speaking about County Meath.  While much has been delivered, much has yet to be delivered and much is left to do to undo the drastic policies over the years of closing down many of the rural rail networks, for instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">In this city we have only of late dealt with the closure of the Harcourt Street line with the opening of the quite successful Luas line, despite my objections to it being a private company.  The success of Luas and also the success of the DART when it was introduced show that the public is willing to use an effective and efficient public transport network.  While I was quite young at the time, I remember the naysayers when the DART was introduced and the arguments by many that it was a waste of public money because the public would not use the DART system.  However, we are now discussing how to extend DART stations and the route itself to cater for the great desire by the public to use this public transport network.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The same can be said of the Luas.  Again many people said it was an investment too far and that it would not be effective or able to deal with the road network.  However, it has been quite successful and there is a demand that a Luas-type system be extended to many other areas in Dublin, including parts of my constituency.  There is a proposal to extend it as far as Lucan.  I have heard nobody object to the concept of extending it.  There are only objections to its precise route.  This proves the public is interested in public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">We have missed an opportunity in that we are now at a time when public resources are not as flúirseach as they were.  Even in these stringent times investment needs to be put into public transport.  I urge us to continue to look at the projects which were being discussed because they will cater in many cases for communities that cannot afford cars or the cost of car parking if they are travelling into and out of the city to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The other key requirement is that those services be integrated.  The Luas, Arrow and bus services need to be integrated at the key crossing points.  From discussions with representatives of Iarnród Éireann and the Luas, I know those plans were in place.  However, that needs to be fast-tracked.  That should be in line with what the junior partners in Government should be demanding.  That public investment in laying the groundwork for the future should happen.  However, one agency missing from the scope of the Bill, which would allow such development to happen in an integrated way because there would be a single authority, is the Railway Procurement Agency and the powers it has to confiscate or compulsorily purchase land depending on one's state of mind or whether one owns the house or not.  That aspect should be transferred into this in order to give linked-in thinking.  I will come back to the railway procurement plans at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I have outlined some of my main concerns.  While this would not be my area of expertise, as a Dubliner who has for many years depended on bus services, I have major concerns regarding the public service obligation that other public companies have.  For instance An Post has a public service obligation to ensure that post is delivered to every house in the country.  As far as I know there is no public service obligation — it would probably be unrealistic to demand it — that public transport be provided for every single house in the country.  However, that needs to underpin anything we do on public transport.  As much as possible an effective and efficient public transport network should be created which services as many communities as possible.  I heard Deputy McEntee say that he and his party cannot justify one or two people on some of the rural bus services.  One of the reasons only one or two people are on the buses is that for too many years the State has concentrated its investment on roads rather than on the public transport system.  People have shied away from the buses because they cannot depend on them or they are not available at the key times when they are needed, which are at the various rush hours or at key points at the weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">By investing in public transport people will become dependent on it and rely on it if it is effective and efficient.  It will move people away from the single occupancy car that drives up and down the country too regularly.  It will help deal with one of the other aspects of which we are continually reminded, the carbon footprint.  The more we invest in public transport and the more we encourage people to use public transport, the more likely we are to deliver on our commitments as a nation to reduce our carbon footprint.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">I wish to return to the aspect of privatisation I mentioned earlier.  This Bill is a remnant of the Progressive Democrats era, albeit that Fianna Fáil has embraced that party's policy of undermining the public sector and opting for privatisation wherever possible.  The new bus licensing regulations contained in the Bill will have a serious impact on public transport services.  Section 10 is entitled "General provisions for the consideration of applications for grant of licences".  I commend the Oireachtas Library and research facility for producing the Bill digests which are informative and useful when Members do not have expertise in a certain field.  While the explanatory memoranda can be quite technical, the digests provide a useful indication of the range of a Bill.  However, the digest for this Bill indicates that the new regime of procurement of public transport services through contracts should eventually open the State bus companies up to competition.  This should be set against the background of the continuing effects of the disastrous decision to privatise Aer Lingus which seems increasingly likely to become effectively a British company, with the greater number of its employees based in that country.  Likewise, we continue to experience the consequences of the disastrous privatisation of Telecom Éireann, particularly in respect of broadband provision.  Despite these warnings, it seems we are going down the same route in regard to bus services.  I will not go back as far as Irish Ferries.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I am concerned that the Bill will lead to a situation where private operators will cherry pick profitable routes.  It is imperative that there be substantial investment in public transport in order to ensure there are services for all communities.  I spoke in recent months to trade union representatives at Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann who explained to me the dangers of the licensing regime as it currently exists, whereby Dublin Bus has been prevented from developing certain routes because the relevant licences have already issued to private operators who have failed to put the services in place on those routes.  The Minister might give some consideration to their proposal for a use it or lose it clause whereby a licence will revert to the authority if the operator who was not granted that licence does not put the relevant service in place within a specified timeframe.  That is something we can discuss on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Public services belong to the people and the notion that they should be run on the basis of profit alone is a dangerous one which will leave individuals and communities isolated.  Experience shows us that once public transport is privatised, the logic of profit overrides all other considerations.  One need only look to the farcical rail services in operation in Britain since privatisation for proof of this.  The ideology behind the Bill will lead to a reduction in services in those areas which cannot offer a frequency of usage acceptable to the profit-making needs of private operators.  In practical terms, people will be left stranded at bus stops unless the operator is confident it can fill every bus.  The danger is that it will be considered insufficient to run a service at anything less than full capacity.  My party and I have always been opposed to the privatisation of our public transport system.  There is no reason that an efficient and cost effective transport system cannot be provided by the public sector for the maximum benefit of communities and with the primary function of serving people rather than profit.  This has been proven in cities such as Stockholm and Brussels where the excellent public transport systems put our own to shame.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The Bill also seeks to subsume the Commission for Taxi Regulation into the proposed national transport authority.  However, the only significant change I can identify is an increase in the sanctions for unlicensed taxi operation.  Much more is required in this section to tackle the debacle that is the taxi industry.  The tenfold increase in the number of licences since deregulation in 2000 has led to a substantial deterioration in work standards and service standards for the public and a substantial reduction in driver earnings.  We have an opportunity in the Bill, in dealing with the taxi regulator, to undo the damage that has been done in recent years.  For example, the legislation should include proposals for a temporary moratorium on the issuing of licences, a provision whereby the commission be empowered to buy back licences and the introduction of a new regime where licences may only be issued in accordance with public demand.  Measures must also be taken to end such abuses as the duplication of taxi plates, for example, where more than one person is driving the same car with a similar plate, thus undermining those who are genuinely seeking work as taxi drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The millions of euro in licence fees collected by the commission must be invested rather than merely left sitting in the bank.  The Minister referred to a figure of some €21 million earlier in the year.  That money must be reinvested in order to help those drivers who are struggling.  Nobody is proposing that we return to the ridiculous situation that pertained prior to 2000.  However, there must be a degree of regulation of the industry such that there are sufficient taxis to serve the public's needs rather than allowing a flooded market.  The latter obliges people to work 80 or 90 hours a week to earn a living.  Many have no alternative employment and, being self-employed, would not be entitled to the jobseeker's allowance should they choose to give up their plate.  That is the dilemma for many drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I intend to introduce amendments on Committee Stage to give effect to the changes that are required in regard to public transport provision.  Our transport system has taken hit after hit, with funding slashed in various areas and the abolition of the night-time rural transport service.  Investment is essential even given our difficulties in terms of public finances.  Years of underinvestment have left the service in its current state.  Reckless decisions have been made regarding public transport without even a cursory consideration of how they will affect vulnerable people in rural communities.  Given that the recession is likely to see increasing numbers becoming dependent on public transport, the Government and the transport companies must be careful in their proposals to cut back on routes and frequency of service.  The McCarthy report recommends the selling off of the Bus Éireann expressway service as well as the complete abolition of the rural transport programme.  Mr. McCarthy and his team clearly do not depend on public transport.  Their recommendations show scant regard for the need for quality transport services now and for the future.  The loss of rural services will have a severe effect on communities, where they are vital in allowing people to access employment and in ensuring that those most at risk of social exclusion have access to essential services.  Years of investment in roads encouraged people to depend on cars rather than on public services.  The benefits arising from better public transport provision in rural areas include reduced greenhouse gases, social inclusion and rural development opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The mayoral role needs to be fleshed out on Committee Stage.  The Railway Procurement Agency is immersed in a debacle where it is foisting a portal on the community beside the CIE works in Inchicore rather than siting it in the CIE works proper where it would not impact on the community.  We need to be careful that the RPA, which should come under the remit of the legislation, does not continue to have the <i>carte blanche</i> powers it currently has.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I will discuss a number of these proposals on Committee Stage and, hopefully, when it is passed, the Bill will not encourage the privatisation of our public transport system and will enhance investment and public involvement in it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ChrisAndrews" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_604">I am glad the Minister is present for my contribution and I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The purpose of the Bill is to establish a modern system for the licensing of commercial public bus passenger services with the objective of promoting regulated competition in the provision of licensed public bus passenger services on a national basis and, more important, in the public interest.  The Bill also promotes integrated, well functioning and cost efficient public passenger transport services and provides for the introduction of new contractual arrangements for the procurement of public land transport services on a national basis, which is modelled on the approach established in the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 in respect of the greater Dublin area.  This legislation is critical and long overdue and I congratulate the Minister on taking a lead in this area.  As he highlighted in introducing the Bill, it is 77 years since the Road Transport Act was implemented but there is no comparison between the transport network of 70 years ago and that of today.  My grandfather closed most of the railway lines but there have been many changes since then.  They say the sins of the father are visited on the son but that is not quite the case here.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">A well functioning bus service is the backbone of any urban area.  Unlike in the United States, where taking the bus is seen as something that should be avoided, people of all ages take the bus in Ireland.  One can take it at any time of the day and one will see students, older people who may no longer wish to drive, parents with their schoolchildren and professionals as they make their way to work every day.  The quality bus corridor that runs through Stillorgan has been hugely successful.  Despite people at the time in RTE saying it would be an obstacle to commuters, it has been extremely successful.  My colleague, Deputy Mansergh, referred to the free transport scheme introduced by Fianna Fáil, which was, and is, of huge benefit to older people.  When people reach the age they are entitled to a free travel pass, they take it with great celebration and it reduces the sense of isolation they may feel.  In some cases they travel for the first time in decades and the extension of the scheme to Northern Ireland is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">A number of Members referred to the bus gate at College Green in Dublin.  While in theory the bus gate is a good idea, the timing of its introduction was not correct.  Retailers in the city centre are struggling with high rents and falling revenue and, while this is not all due to the bus gate, I favour suspending the scheme until the new bridges are in place next year.  There has to be a compromise on this matter that will benefit transport users and that will ensure Dublin centre does not become a retail graveyard.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">Public consultations were held earlier this year with older people around the country, who pointed out that access to mobility was critical to remaining connected with society.  The same is true in Dublin and the Luas is a transport success story.  One line runs right through Dublin South-East and it has made an impact on people living along the route.  It is much preferable to use light rail rather than the car.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The Minister stated the objective of the legislation is the promotion of regulated competition on a national basis in the public interest, which is a critical issue.  The needs of those who use public transport must be at the heart of our transport policy.  As he said, commercial operators will always work to their own agenda, which is, unsurprisingly, to make a profit.  While competition is healthy, commercial operators cannot be allowed to select and cherry pick the routes that are most profitable with no consideration of less profitable routes and the social consequences of such decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The State has a responsibility to its citizens to provide a well functioning, cost effective and comprehensive transport system.  The Minister has done a great deal of work to ensure this vision comes about and section 10 is critical in this regard.  It sets out a range of matters in the application of bus licences and will ensure all applications must be considered in the context of potential demand for a proposed service having specific regard for the needs of customers.  I alluded to private sector companies trying to protect their position but the State agencies also seek to protect their position in the market.  While this reflects human nature, it is up to the State to regulate and that is why the Bill is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The formation of the new National Transport Authority is a also a sensible step.  It makes sense to amalgamate agencies that deal with certain aspects of a particular system, in this case transport.  I hope it will lead to greater efficiencies and a more joined up approach to our transport policy in the coming years.  However there is no comparison between urban and rural transport systems and I warn against a one size fits all approach.  The Minister is aware of this and the legislation ensures such an approach will not be adopted.  I agree with the Minister that the Bill will bring greater clarity and fairness to the bus route licensing system and I welcome the fact that the needs of the people are at its core.  Urban and rural transport are subject to different demands and, therefore, the criteria for licences will be different.  I agree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh that the people want a good public transport system and the Bill will endeavour to provide that.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_630">This is an important motion because it goes to the heart of the way our country has been run under this Government and the lack of accountability of major State and semi-State organisations which have controlled and spent vast amounts of public money since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">Since 1997, CIE has received and spent €6.23 billion of taxpayers' money, broken down by capital funding of €3.2 billion and an Exchequer subvention of €3.3 billion.  Taxpayers' money is being misspent.  After all the wasted years of this Government, we still have none of the policies that might deliver the change that is needed.  We do not have proper national park and ride facilities, integrated ticketing, real-time traveller information, bus competition or independent review of route and frequency strategy so taxpayers can see what they are paying for.  We do not have policies for peak-hour spreading or incentives for off-peak travel.  We have no Dublin transport authority, a year after the legislation was passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The subvention to Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann quadrupled in the past ten years but the number of buses has remained almost static.  Dublin Bus is now taking buses off the road in order to save money.  Issues such as this cannot be adequately addressed by the Oireachtas when requests for information as continually frustrated by CIE.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">In 1999, the subvention for Dublin Bus was €16.8 million when the fleet size was 987.  In 2009, the subvention had risen to €82.4 million, yet the fleet size was 1,028.  The Bus Éireann subvention commenced in 1999 at €7.4 million.  In 2009, it had risen to €44.9 million whereas the fleet has increased by 70 buses.  There is a lack of accountability for this spending and a lack of oversight by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Senator Shane Ross reported this issue in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and, on 14 October, we wrote to Irish Rail seeking a copy of the Baker Tilly report, which alleged serious wrongdoing at a very high level in CIE and specifically in Iarnród Éireann.  The answer given was that “the Baker Tilly report is an internal report commissioned by Iarnród Éireann.  The report itself contains material which is both commercially sensitive and the subject of legal proceedings.  As a result, I regret that we cannot use this report externally.”</p>
          <p eId="para_635">This is a significant and serious issue.  Access to a report in which the word "fraud" was mentioned something like 17 times was denied by Iarnród Éireann to the Oireachtas and the Fine Gael transport spokesperson.  Surprisingly, the report was then placed in the Oireachtas Library at 6 o'clock on the Friday evening of a bank holiday weekend, when the Joint Committee on Transport was due to meet on the following Tuesday to discuss the report - which had not been released to us - and to raise these issues.  I do not know why the Minister placed the report in the Oireachtas Library so late.  Perhaps he did not receive it until that morning.  I do not know why we could not have seen it earlier.  The key point in the report was identified by the Minister in the House last Thursday night at 9 p.m., when he said he was gravely concerned about the import of the report and what was going on in CIE companies, specifically Iarnród Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">CIE is not being held accountable to the House.  CIE management come to meetings of a joint committee occasionally but the company is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act and it ought to be.  If it was, reports such as this would be available and could be debated in this House and at the Joint Committee on Transport.  If the company was subject to the Freedom of Information Act, we would have much greater oversight of what is going on in CIE companies and of the billions of euro which have been spent.  We would know if the system was faulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I am not criticising the excellent work done by the vast majority of employees of CIE.  Neither do I criticise employees of FÁS or the NRA.  I am talking about decision making, usually at the top but not necessarily so, where abuses are taking place.  The Minister for Transport would not know about the Baker Tilly report if Senator Shane Ross had not published it in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  The wool is being pulled over the Minister’s eyes.  CIE is treating him as a ribbon-cutter, who goes to opening ceremonies to cut ribbons and have his photograph taken.  There is no substantial accountability, either to the Minister or to the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">It was also noted in a 2007 internal audit annual report, which was presented to the Iarnród Éireann annual review group in March 2008, that "further significant breaches were found in areas which are outside the scope of our report, including significant non-compliance in the chief mechanical engineer's department".  I ask the Minister for an explanation of this and for a copy of that audit report.  It is important that we know exactly what is going on.  This is a serious matter.  It is not acceptable that this is allowed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The budgets and audits of this company must be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Comptroller and Auditor General must scrutinise its audits and there must be Oireachtas oversight, as the Minister refuses to hold it accountable. The company must also be subject to the Freedom of Information Act.  These companies must report to us to ensure that we have credibility and integrity in our system.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I do not ask that the parliamentary question system be changed so that we can ask the Minister why the 5 p.m. train from Cork to Dublin was three minutes late.  However, we should be able to get at the fundamental issues of policy decisions, remuneration of directors, who they are and how they are appointed.  There must be transparency and accountability with regard to policy decisions and major investments in CIE.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I wish to address the allegations in the Baker Tilly report.  The report found there is a fundamental systems deficiency in Iarnród Éireann where procurement procedures relating to the issuing of contracts are concerned.  It also found that stock discrepancies are not being independently investigated to a satisfactory extent and that some staff members are uncertain as to the nature and extent of their duties.  Furthermore, the report highlights the fact that, incredibly, not one manager or senior executive buyer was aware of a corporate procurement strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Serious questions must now be asked and answered as to how such a shoddy system was presided over for so long.  Iarnród Éireann is the beneficiary of handsome State funding and for loose practices to be allowed to go unchecked for so long is completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">This report accelerates the need for CIE's exemption from the Freedom of Information Act to be lifted.  The Minister has not addressed this issue in the Government amendment.  He affirms Government policy.  We do not particularly disagree with anything there, except the lack of accountability.  The Minister has not addressed that issue.  He said he accepts there are grave issues here and the only way they can be addressed is through greater and further accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Turning to the National Roads Authority, the Freedom of Information Act and related matters, there is a serious issue in regard to the policy in the National Roads Authority.  It is subject to the Freedom of Information Act, although not to parliamentary questions.  I would like the process that applies to the Health Service Executive, whereby if one asks a parliamentary question, one gets an answer from the HSE, to apply to the NRA.  One could ask a parliamentary question through the Minister for Transport.  The issues would have to be substantive in order to get a direct response from the National Roads Authority.  That would be a simple way to address some of the lack of accountability there.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The key issue on which I wish to focus is safety in the Dublin Port tunnel and the frustration of my freedom of information request on this issue by the National Roads Authority.  We discovered through a "Prime Time" programme on RTE by Mr. Paul Murphy that there were serious problems with the Dublin Port tunnel.  Having brought in the National Roads Authority and having got evasive replies from Mr. Barry, the chief executive officer, I decided to make a freedom of information request on a particular report on safety.  That report was dated 2007 but it took me a year to get it from the Information Commissioner because the National Roads Authority refused to give me a copy of the report, which it had and which was fundamental to my charge that the port tunnel was open while it was in an unsafe condition.  That is a very serious charge.  I made a freedom of information request as I was frustrated in my efforts to get to the bottom of that issue initially raised by RTE.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">There were two reports, one of which was the Martin Kelly report which was earlier than the one about which I will speak later and which looked at what was going on in the tunnel in 2007.  It looked at all the systems in it and found significant problems.  For instance, the over height detection system, which is supposed to tell one a lorry is over height, would not work in 10% of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">It found the communications network, which was essential for the proper running of a complex system like a port tunnel, had not been designed and configured for the safety critical requirements of the Dublin Port tunnel.  It stated there was very limited diversity in the configuration to take account of a major incident in the tunnel; there were a number of single points of failure of network components; the network took too long to reconnect and reconfigure after a component failure; the installed devices were designed for commercial and not industrial applications; they were not as robust and reliable as they should be for this application; and that some of the network components were obsolete.  One is talking about a tunnel which cost approximately €580 million not being fit for purpose when it was originally opened and not being safe, as this report bears out.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_649">The network is so delicate that there are a significant number of "out of communications" errors each week.  In an 8 day period in April there were around 1000 "out of communications" errors occurring daily.  In a period at the end of June 07 the occurrences had reduced to around 40 per day.  This reduction is probably because there is now some temporary air conditioning equipment installed in most equipment rooms.  If this is the reason for the reduction, then it is obvious that a permanent HVAC system is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The report further states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_651">Because there is insufficient or no redundancy of certain items, when a component fails, it causes the system to shutdown.  This has happened on a number of occasions since opening.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The report refers to incidents on certain dates.  This is essentially a charter on how not to build a port tunnel and a charter of evasiveness of a State body, the National Roads Authority, which refuses to be accountable and frustrates our efforts in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The SCADA system is supposed to be an operational system to run the tunnel.  The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_654">When a fault occurs that cannot easily be identified TTO have to rely on the support of local Indra technicians.  These technicians sometimes have to contact their engineers in Spain to carry out remote analysis of the system to trace the fault and sometimes rectify the fault.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">People in Spain must remotely access the Dublin Port tunnel, which cost approximately €580 million, to fix a system because nobody there knows how it works.  What has been going on?  What oversight did the National Roads Authority have?</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The worst is contained in the second report which I could not get for a year either.  It looked at the design of the tunnel.  It stated that the results of tests confirmed that the operating system was unable to provide the required level of safety, especially in the case of an event leading to important data exchanges such as accident or fire and that this was due to lack of reliability of the systems and inadequate architecture and design, operating deficiencies and an unsuitable man-made interface.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The report further stated that the system was unsuitable particularly because unpredictable and erratic transmission time leads to a range of one to four minutes transmission time for an event detection to the action result and that one must keep in mind that in the case of a fire, people must be evacuated within ten minutes after the fire starts because after this period, the risk of people being killed by the fire is extremely high.  There could be a delay of four minutes.  That is four minutes gone out of the maximum ten minutes one has to get out of the tunnel alive.  We need an investigation in that system.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Even today the National  Roads Authority refuses to be accountable for this issue.  Under an EU directive, it appointed a tunnel safety officer.  When the NRA refused to answer my questions, I tried to contact him.  The reply I received from the NRA stated that it confirmed my request to be provided with a telephone number for this gentleman.  It declined to provide the number for the safety officer for the port tunnel and it advised that it considered it more appropriate that communications with this gentleman should be in writing rather than by telephone.  It stated that it considered that written forms of communication were more appropriate in order to avoid any unintentional misunderstandings or incorrect recollections given the complexity of the subject matter.  It very kindly offered take a letter from me to give to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">For each tunnel, the tunnel safety manager shall co-ordinate all preventative and safeguarding measures to ensure the safety of users and the operation of the tunnel.  The safety officer may be a member of the tunnel staff or the emergency services but he shall be independent in all road tunnel safety issues and shall not be under instruction from an employer in respect of those issues.  My case has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The National Roads Authority is frustrating the truth getting out about what went on in the tunnel for the first two years of its operation.  We cannot hold it accountable, nor can the Minister.  Things must change in the National Roads Authority.  It is not good enough for it to frustrate basic issues such as this.  It is cocking its nose at the Minister and at us and it does not give a damn.  I am not happy about that and I hope the Minister is not either.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">We want accountability and transparency.  CIE must be accountable under freedom of information legislation and the Comptroller and Authority General, otherwise all this money will continue to be wasted, in many cases without accountability and responsibility from those organisations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_662">Last week I sat through a full meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport attended by the chairman and the chief executive and others of CIE and Iarnród Éireann.  I do not have time to go into the details in the few minutes speaking time allotted to me.  The committee would not have seen the report were it not for the fact it appeared in the Sunday newspaper.  We would not have been able to ask the many questions needed.  We expect the board members will be back before the committee and we will have a lot more questions for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I believe the Minister also commented but I certainly was not happy with the procurement systems.  I am not able to say how big a problem exists as I do not have that information but if an interested bystander listened to what happened at that meeting, he or she would know that all was not well at that level.  People I deal with locally would have nothing to do with such type of monkey work, so to speak, which may or may not have taken place.  We must get to the bottom of this situation.  For example, a person with a disability applying to the local authority for the smallest of grants, must procure two or three different tenders.  It appears that on occasion, significant contracts were awarded without that basic principle being applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">I hope to speak on Second Stage of the Public Transport Regulation Bill tomorrow or the day after.  The Minister has a big job on his hands in order to operate and co-ordinate to the best advantage of the travelling public the various codes of transport. I refer to a bus service from Galway to Dublin which in order to cut out the competition is charging €1 a seat from Galway to Dublin.  This is in an attempt to quench a company which has a full licence from the Department of Transport to serve the direct Galway to Dublin route.  The company offering the €1 seat does not have a licence to be on that route.</p>

The Minister has said it will continue but many people, including myself, are becoming sceptical as each day passes.  I expect the Minister will refer to it in his concluding contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The subvention is being increased but there will need to be much better value for money.  I ask the Minister to note that one cannot compare sparsely populated areas such as parts of the west of Ireland with Dublin city.  The subvention system cannot be used the same way in either place.  The rural transport initiative is very important for the outlying areas of the west of Ireland.  I ask the Minister to ensure a balance.  Córas Iompair Éireann, Iarnród Éireann and Bus Éireann are doing a fantastic job and they have come on in leaps and bounds.  However, unless the private sector is given an opportunity to compete, then we will be back to the bad old days which is something neither the Minister nor I would want to see happening.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_671">I am pleased to speak on this important motion on which I commend Deputy O'Dowd.  The National Roads Authority, NRA, has developed new roads across the country and made great improvements in infrastructure.  However, the subject of this Private Members' motion is echoed in every council chamber across the country, including support from members of the Minister's party when they see at first hand the difficulty in making representations about issues to the NRA.  Some of them have become frustrated over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">For instance, in my constituency of Tipperary South, a bypass has been required for several years for Tipperary town which has been clogged with traffic for years.  Several Ministers over a long period have stated that a bypass was badly needed and have given commitments.  The current Minister has also given a commitment to consider this issue.  The NRA has consistently put it on the back burner.  A small amount of money is allocated every year to cover the design and smaller issues.  However, it is far away from being started.  There is a question about how the NRA is spending the significant funding.  Members of local authorities find it impossible to find out.  We need to have access to the NRA so that we can find out this information.  When a small change needs to be made in a major roads project, it is very difficult.  For instance on the Dublin to Cork road when a rural community outside Kilcoran near Cahir was being cut off, it took a long time for the NRA to make a decision.  Parliamentary questions, interventions and deputations to Ministers were employed.  Something that would not have cost too much to achieve initially, took a long time and was very frustrating.  These are the difficulties encountered by people in accessing the NRA.  This is quite unfair in these times when accountability is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">With regard to CIE, a total of €6.3 billion of taxpayers' money has been spent on CIE by way of subsidy since 1997.  This begs the question as to what has been CIE's overall plan.  Why has it allowed the transport of goods by rail to go to transport by road?  We have spent vast amounts of money yet we have allowed what was a good well structured rail network lose that valuable goods business.  It is wrong and it is unfair to the taxpayer.  It is unfair of the Government to allow this to happen.  I ask the Minister even at this late stage to explain why taxpayers' money is being spent and the goods transport business is being lost.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_674">I wish to support this motion and to commend Deputy Fergus O'Dowd and the Fine Gael Party on tabling it.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">Other speakers have raised the issue of significant amounts of taxpayers' money being paid to the NRA and CIE in the past 11 or 12 years.  A total of almost €20 billion has been paid through these agencies to provide much needed upgrades in our infrastructural network in roads and railways and to ensure efficient and reliable services on our trains and buses throughout the country.  The reality is that some of that money has been well spent but many questions remain to be answered on a significant amount that has been badly spent, misspent, overspent or wasted.  It would be in some way acceptable if there were transparent and accountable procedures in place such that people could be held accountable for the mistakes made and the money wasted.  If that happened, structures could be put in place to prevent a recurrence and the public's confidence would be somewhat restored.  Instead, we found out many years later there was in excess of a €4.1 billion overrun on the roads programme adding 60% to the original cost.  The NRA was set up to avoid such an occurrence but instead facilitated it.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The port tunnel is a good case in point.  Eventually, it cost four times the original estimate, overshooting the costing by €580 million.  It was discovered late in the day that it was not big enough to accommodate certain trucks.  Some weeks ago my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, discovered that it was not safe for use when it opened in 2006.  This would be very funny were it not so serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">It is not acceptable that CIE does not come under the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General such that no proper audit or analysis of spending can take place.  Also, it is not good enough that CIE does not come under the Freedom of Information Act, as outlined earlier by Deputy O'Dowd.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">It is in no one's interest that there is a lack of transparency and accountability in these two bodies and it is not fair on the hundreds of people who work in these organisations, who do a fine job, but are hampered by archaic and restrictive practices that erode confidence in the public mindset.  For example, subventions to Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann have quadrupled in recent years but buses are now being taken off routes instead of an increase in services.  This must be explained.  Deputy O'Dowd referred to the need to answer questions on the substantive issue.  However, as Deputy Hayes remarked, at a local level issues remain and in my constituency of Mayo there are ongoing threats to bus routes in rural and tourist areas such as Cong and Achill that require accessibility from larger towns and cities.  Recently, a bus was withdrawn which services Ireland West Airport in Knock.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The lack of accountability and transparency has had a significant impact on the ability of Deputies to get answers for constituents within a reasonable timeframe.  Questions to the Minister are usually passed on, kicked to touch or not answered at all.  For example, it may be a small issue in the overall context, today I received an answer from the NRA regarding the adjustment of speed limits on an NRA road but I have been chasing the answer for almost two years.  We also get the same "pass the parcel" approach between county councils and the NRA on matters of signage or access from bypasses to original roads.  The Minister opened the Charlestown bypass more than one and a half years ago but ongoing trouble with accessibility to the older road continues and many accidents have taken place.  Similarly the early bird train service between Mayo and Dublin was announced recently.  It will travel from Westport and Castlebar but Ballina and north Mayo have been totally ignored.  Given the delay in the building of the N26 route, this service could have been extended to the north of the county.  These matters may not be important to the Minister but they are very important to my constituency and others throughout the country.  I strongly commend the motion to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_680">In the brief time I have I wish to highlight some issues relating to Iarnród Éireann and issues of public accountability related to the National Roads Authority.  I commend the efforts of our party spokesperson on transport, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, in tabling the motion.  Not only does it challenge the lack of financial accountability, it also challenges the lack of public accountability.  In my short time in the House I have tabled 20 parliamentary questions related to national primary and secondary roads which have been disallowed for answer.  Given the times in which we live and the need of people for more transparency that is no way to carry out democracy and it does nothing to legitimise our role as Members representing our constituencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The first casualty of poor public accountability is safety.  I refer the Minister to a specific example in my constituency.  I do not take the opportunity to be parochial but if the Minister were to assist, many safety issues arising throughout the country, such as those highlighted by Deputy O'Mahony, could be addressed.  If one were to carry out a safety audit on the N56 outside Letterkenny, a new road, well built and constructed, several issues would arise.  Safety anomalies arise related to footpath provision, lack of public lighting, safety issues outside a primary school and a lack of turning lanes.  Such issues create numerous hazards on that stretch of road.  There were two car accidents as recently as this weekend and in the past three or four months there have been numerous other car accidents on this stretch of road.  The Minister's Department, not the NRA, should carry out a safety audit on this stretch of road.  Only then would the Minister gather an insight into the problems associated with this stretch of road and many similar roads throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The missing link is in respect of public accountability.  No one among the county councillors, the executive level in Donegal County Council or the Members has the parliamentary privilege of a single line answer in respect of the NRA, which is not acceptable. I am pleased our colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, has put this matter into the thrust of the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">I recognise CIE is referred to in the motion but CIE is the parent company of Iarnród Éireann and it is this company to which I refer.  Between 2002 and 2006 some €1.3 billion was spent on railway infrastructure in the country, including new rail on the western rail corridor, to which Deputy Paul Connaughton referred.  This money was also spent on the upgrade of new infrastructure in respect of rail or transportation cargo.  Within the €1.3 billion allocation there was a 3% contribution from Europe, which would have come from the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency.  My figures indicate a sum of €39.6 million came from Europe.  I cannot establish where this money was spent.  The Minister must indicate, either by contacting Iarnród Éireann or through the good offices of the Department, where this money was spent.  Was it spent on the Cork to Dublin railway line or was it spent on the Dublin to Belfast railway line, for which it would have been intended because of the trans-European cross-Border funding mechanism?  At present, Iarnród Éireann will only provide a figure for the Belfast to Cork route, which implies it is not willing to breakdown the percentage spent on the Dublin to Belfast and the Dublin to Cork route.  My fear is that money may have been used specifically for the Cork to Dublin line.  If the Minister's figures show the majority of the money was spent on the Cork to Dublin line, the implication is funding on a cross-Border basis was used for the Cork to Dublin line.  My geography and my education inform me the line from Cork to Dublin does not cross the Border.  If this is the case and if the figures show the vast majority of funding was spent on the Cork to Dublin corridor, there must be accountability.  The public deserves such accountability, especially since there was once an all-island railway link and perhaps that is what we should pursue rather than to consider drawing down money in an non-accountable way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_695">Thanks to this Fine Gael motion, I have the opportunity to report on the progress made by agencies including the NRA and CIE in upgrading our transport infrastructure and on the beneficial impact of the sustained high level of investment in transport; on the arrangements to evaluate and monitor Exchequer funded capital and current expenditure by the NRA and CIE; and on the arrangements to ensure the NRA and CIE are accountable to the Government and the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Transport 21 continues to provide the strategic framework guiding Government investment in transport infrastructure.  The primary purpose of this unprecedented investment programme is to progressively deliver a first class national roads network and a modern, integrated public transport system that provides reduced journey times for commercial activity around the country and facilitates the more efficient movement of people.  This is the fourth year of Transport 21.  In the first three years Exchequer funding amounted to a total of almost €6.8 billion.  Expenditure in 2006 was €1.94 billion; in 2007, almost €2.4 billion; and in 2008, €2.5 billion.  The Exchequer allocation for 2009 is €2.1 billion.  These are massive amounts of money committed by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Great progress has been made to date, with many of the projects completed or nearing completion.  Over 66% of the major interurban motorways are now open to traffic and the remainder are under construction and on target to open in 2010.  The upgrade of the M50 is on target for completion in 2010.  By the end of 2010 we will have built a 750 km interurban motorway network, an unprecedented achievement in such a short time.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">Good progress is also being made on improving public transport infrastructure and services.  The Cork commuter rail line opened earlier this year and both phase 1 of the western rail corridor and the Kildare rail line are due to be completed by the end of 2009 or in early 2010.  Work is under way on phase 1 of the Navan line.  The Luas extension to the docklands will open in early December.  Two other Luas extensions to Cherrywood and Citywest are under construction and will open in 2010 and 2011 respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Irish Rail fleets have been renewed and increased, resulting in greater accessibility and improved services on many rail and bus routes.  The new regional railcar fleet has allowed Irish Rail to expand services in an economical and efficient way, even in this difficult economic environment.  The company recently announced a range of new services to take effect from the end of this month, such as two new early bird Monday to Friday services, from Westport to Dublin and Galway to Dublin respectively.  The company is introducing new services on the DART line to provide a service every 15 minutes off-peak.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">In addition to capital funding the CIE companies receive an annual subvention towards the cost of loss-making socially and economically necessary services.  This subvention is over €303 million in 2009.  Along with capital funding, it has enabled the CIE companies to improve the quantity and quality of bus and rail services throughout the country.  The result of this investment and increased subvention was a strong growth in passenger numbers up to 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Despite this high level of current funding the companies are now facing a very difficult financial position due to the sharp economic downturn.  The companies now face the difficult challenge of lower passenger numbers, higher costs and static subvention.  This requires the urgent and vigorous pursuit of cost recovery plans to reduce and eventually eliminate operating deficits.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Given the scale of Transport 21, the Government recognised the need to put in place processes and procedures to ensure a rigorous evaluation, monitoring and auditing regime for the major projects involved.  My Department has established detailed monitoring procedures and carries out audits at various levels.  At the start of Transport 21, a high level monitoring group was established to oversee the implementation of the programme.  The monitoring group oversees an intensive audit programme that is undertaken by independent consultants.  These audits review the appraisal and the financial and physical implementation of selected Transport 21 projects.  In 2007 and 2008, audits relating to projects with a total estimated capital cost of €2.6 billion were carried out.  Six additional audits are being carried out in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Financial and physical progress audits carried out to date have found that projects are generally being implemented in a satisfactory way.  The findings of Transport 21 appraisal audits have verified that the implementing agencies are continuing to appraise Transport 21 projects in accordance with Guidelines on a Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects and Programmes, a document developed by my Department, and the Department of Finance document, Guidelines for the Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">All major Transport 21 projects are subject to detailed cost benefit analyses that are carried out as part of the project selection and approval process.  The results of cost benefit analyses are published on the Transport 21 website once projects have reached construction stage.  Transport 21 is being managed in accordance with best practice and this is delivering dividends for the taxpayer and the transport user.  These benefits are particularly evident in the case of the national roads programme.  It is a tribute to the great work of the NRA and local authorities that most major road projects, including recent examples such as the Tullamore and Waterford city bypasses, finished within time and within budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Projects benefiting from EU Structural Fund assistance are subject to detailed procedures and checks to ensure compliance with the relevant EU rules.  As well as checks by the agencies and my Department, audits are conducted by financial control unit within the Department of Finance, the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors.  The combination of domestic and EU oversight of the transport investment programme provides a high level of assurance but no level of sample checking can ensure that no mistakes are ever made.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The annual subvention paid to CIE has been subject to independent reviews over the years.  The most recent was in 2006 when a value for money review was carried out as part of the expenditure review process of the Department of Finance.  That review concluded that good value has been obtained for the subvention, which has supported a better service than would have been the case in the absence of the subvention.  The annual subvention paid to CIE is currently administered through a memorandum of understanding with each of the CIE companies.  These memoranda have been in place since 2003 and are negotiated annually with the companies.  They set out service quantity and quality requirements and require quarterly reporting against targets.  In anticipation of the EU regulation relating to compensation for the discharge of public service obligations, due to come into force before the end of the year, public service contracts to replace the memoranda of understanding are being finalised.  These contracts will set higher requirements for transparency and performance obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">A cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann was undertaken in 2008 on my direction.  This report made a number of recommendations to improve bus services to customers, and in the case of Dublin Bus to increase efficiency and save money.  The recommendations are being implemented.  A value for money study of the €500 million second railway safety programme, published in early 2009, concluded that the programme objectives on projected outputs were broadly met and that the cost of the work delivered was generally economically efficient.  Nevertheless, the report into procurement practices in Irish Rail raises serious concerns about the internal arrangements in Irish Rail relating to the purchase of goods and services.  I am due to receive a full report from the CIE board on the matter and I will then decide on any further necessary action on my part.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">Striking the right balance between giving State agencies the freedom to get on with the job and putting in place adequate arrangements to ensure that they account for their stewardship of public funds is difficult.  We have created a range of public bodies to carry out important tasks on behalf of the State and the taxpayer.  The job of the Government and the Oireachtas is to hold them accountable for the delivery of a clearly stated mandate, but not to interfere with the day-to-day execution of that mandate.  I believe the Government is getting that balance right.  We have given transport agencies such as the NRA and CIE a clear mandate through successive national development plans, Transport 21 and memoranda of understanding.  Their corporate governance obligations are set out in the code of practice published by the Department of Finance and they have a range of specific reporting obligations as to compliance.  However, if we set up State bodies, we have to give them authority, responsibility, resources and the space to do their jobs effectively.  It is also important to distinguish between ministerial and agency accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I have spoken in some detail about the accountability regime applying to the capital and current funding programmes of the NRA and CIE.  I now want to examine the wider accountability arrangements set down in their governing legislation and by the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  Under the Roads Act 1993, the NRA is charged with managing the development, improvement and maintenance of national roads.  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of national roads.  The implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for the NRA under the Roads Act 1993 in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.  The Government sets the investment framework in Transport 21 and provides annual Exchequer block grants to the authority.  The NRA decides on the allocation of those funds and I have no role whatsoever in the discharge of that function.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">As a non-commercial State body which receives significant State funding — more than €1.4 billion for 2009 — the NRA's accounts are subject to annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Over the years, the Comptroller and Auditor General has carried out evaluation and value for money studies on the NRA's roads programme, including the West Link buy-out which I note is the subject of a special report in the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2008 accounts.  The NRA regularly appears before the Committee of Public Accounts to account for its stewardship of public funds.  It also appears regularly before other Oireachtas committees to answer for the discharge of its statutory functions and it is open to the relevant committee to question it on any matter as frequently and deeply as it requires.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">Under the Roads Act 1993, the NRA is required to prepare and submit annual accounts to me which are then presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The authority is also subject to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies which requires it to comply with requirements relating to a broad range of matters, including remuneration, risk management, audit, procurement and capital investment, and to report annually to me on compliance with those requirements.  In addition, I meet with senior representatives of the NRA on a regular basis, for example, on four occasions in 2008 and in May of this year.  This is in addition to informal meetings with NRA board members and senior officials at the many road openings during the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Specifically on Oireachtas oversight, I note that already this year the NRA appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport on 15 July and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 6 October.  In addition, the NRA will appear again before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport on 18 November and before the Committee of Public Accounts on 3 December with my Department.  This is hardly evidence of a lack of public accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">CIE must prepare and submit to me an annual report and accounts which I in turn submit to the Government and place before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It must prepare and submit half-yearly accounts to me.  It must also comply with the requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies on a broad range of matters, including remuneration, risk management, audit, procurement and capital investment, and the chairman must report annually to me on compliance with the requirements of the code.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The CIE chairman and the chief executives of the three operating companies appear regularly before Oireachtas committees, particularly the Joint Committee on Transport.  Since January 2008, the chairman and-or chief executives of the CIE companies have appeared before Oireachtas committees on nine occasions.  The companies are also subject to the accounting rules and practices and independent auditing standards that apply to any commercial undertaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">I meet regularly with the chairman and-or chief executives of the CIE companies.  I have had 11 formal meetings with the chairman and-or chief executives of the CIE companies since 1 January 2008.  I am also accountable to the Oireachtas in respect of my statutory functions whether through parliamentary questions, debates on Estimates and my Department's output statement, policy debates, Private Members' business, Adjournment debates and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_730">I stress that I am accountable for my statutory functions, while the NRA and CIE are accountable for theirs.  The Fine Gael motion seems to suggest that the Minister and the Department should be answerable for all and every aspect of the activities of the NRA and CIE.  This is neither reasonable nor practicable and if followed to its logical conclusion would result in every detail finishing up on the Minister's desk.  Such an approach would delay decision making, result in a damaging lack of clarity about the role of the agency and the Minister, would undermine the role and responsibility of the agency boards and management and would be contrary to best practice in corporate governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The NRA and CIE are established under statutes which set out the responsibility of their boards and management for fulfilling their statutory responsibility.  The code of practice for the governance of State bodies complements the statutory provisions by setting out a governance framework for the way State bodies do their business.  Under that code, the chairperson is placed under a particular obligation to certify, annually, compliance with a range of requirements under the code relating to financial control, audit and procurement.  In addition, good practice dictates that I and my Department are alerted to significant actual or potential problems.  This is generally what happens.  As with the recent Irish Rail procurement issues, it does not always happen but we should not engage in knee-jerk responses to such an incident by insisting that everything has to be reported to the Minister.  This would not be feasible, workable or appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">The NRA is subject to the Freedom of Information Act, but CIE is not.  Commercial State bodies have not been included under FOI legislation because it would compromise their ability to act commercially and compete effectively in the markets in which they operate.  It is often the case, however, that records of public bodies not subject to FOI may come within the scope of a FOI request and be released by virtue of being held by a Department.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_733">I thank the Minister for sharing time with me and for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this important Private Members' motion tabled by Deputy O'Dowd and Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">It is a timely motion because it is appropriate to discuss in a responsible fashion how we can improve oversight and transparency not only in regard to the bodies named in the motion but also other State agencies and commercial bodies.  I agree in general on the need for these principles when expending public moneys.  The motion refers specifically to CIE as a commercial State company and the NRA as an independent statutory body and in a more general way to other State agencies and semi-State companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Given that the NRA's accounts are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the role of the Committee of Public Accounts in overseeing that official's reports, I believe that body is properly scrutinised.  The NRA will appear before the committee in early December to discuss an issue identified in the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2008 report.  Any member of the committee can ask questions about the NRA's accounts in the presence of the agency's executives and the Accounting Officer of the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The catalyst for this motion is CIE and the recent revelations contained in the Baker Tilly report.  I cannot understand why the company did not inform the Minister in a timely manner about significant issues involving fraud and losses to the Exchequer because of poor financial controls over procurement procedures.  These issues should have been identified at the earliest opportunity but I hope the report he is awaiting will address them in detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I believe the structures we have in place for examining the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General are effective.  In respect of the appropriation accounts of Departments, the HSE, the VECs and the financial statements of non-commercial State sponsored bodies, the committee provides an excellent forum for interrogating witnesses on expenditure decisions to ensure that correct procedures have been followed and value for money achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">As the motion notes, CIE has spent more than €6 billion of taxpayers' money since 1997 and the NRA has spent more than €13 billion since 2000.  These are vast sums by any measure but the great majority has been spent wisely.  I can only speak from my personal experience as a public representative for Cork.  Huge improvements have been made in the areas for which CIE and the NRA are responsible.  Our motorway network has dramatically improved and a fast and safe road between Cork and Dublin will be complete by next year.  New rolling stock has been provided to Iarnród Éireann and the Cork-Dublin line was the first intercity service to use the new fleet.  These developments have transformed the experience for the travelling public in a positive way.  There is now an hourly train service between Cork and Dublin and the Cork-Midleton line was reopened earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">When we speak about the various forms of State bodies, it is important to recognise that the legislation establishing an individual body provides the statutory framework for its operations.  As the Minister has pointed out, Oireachtas committees play a particularly important role in this regard.  When I was first elected, I put down a number of questions on the status of NRA projects in my constituency and was surprised that I was unable to elicit this information.  I acknowledge Deputy O'Dowd's argument that the NRA should not be required to produce the same level of detail as Departments but substantive issues could be addressed by way of parliamentary questions.  Given the amount of public money involved, it is important that Members can receive timely and comprehensive information.  I do not see how we would threaten the role or functions of the NRA by being able to ask questions.  Where it is appropriate, we should reassert the primacy of Dáil Éireann and its elected Members.  In certain instances, power can be devolved from this House to a designated body such as the NRA, which has the necessary statutory powers to overcome the significant obstacles lying in the way of a national road strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">A code of practice for the governance of State bodies requires compliance with measures such as annual reports, half yearly accounts, certificates of compliance, details of internal audit functions and competitive tendering.  It is the function of the boards of these bodies rather than the Oireachtas to monitor the activities of executive management.  We recently debated proposals on an Oireachtas committee to oversee the workings of NAMA.  While oversight is important, it cannot be allowed to interfere with the operational decisions that have to be made by bodies.  The motion makes specific reference to financial, budgeting, procurement and accounting processes, all of which are matters for the boards of the bodies concerned.  Reference is also made to improving the accountability of these boards.  Perhaps Deputy O'Dowd will clarify how that might be achieved given that the NRA is already fully accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The NRA operates transparently in terms of its website, Transport 21, freedom of information requirements and the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">CIE is also subject to a number of important provisions.  Its annual reports are laid before the Oireachtas and its constituent companies appear before the relevant committees on a regular basis.  The Exchequer's capital and current funding for CIE is dealt with in the Estimates process and the Secretary General of the Department of Transport reports to the Committee of Public Accounts on the disbursement of this funding.  Ministerial nominees to the boards of these companies play a particularly important role in reporting on issues of key concern.  In the case of CIE, the Secretary General of the Department is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I thank Deputy O'Dowd for tabling the motion and the Minister for an opportunity to contribute.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_313">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_742">I wish to share time with Deputy Morgan.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">This Fine Gael Party motion is timely as there is an ongoing, serious and dangerous lack of accountability to the Dáil and people we represent in many areas of Government administration.  This problem has grown since 1997 when this Government, in a different form, took office.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I have strong concerns about parts of the motion.  The organisations to which it refers are semi-State bodies.  If they were to be subject to the Committee of Public Accounts and Freedom of Information Act, their commercial mandate could be hobbled and they would be left at a profound disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis </i>private sector companies unless all parties were held responsible to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The trigger for the motion was clearly the recent Baker Tilly report commissioned by CIE to investigate allegations of irregularities in the procurement of certain goods and services in Irish Rail between 2000 and 2006.  I was very unhappy with the procedures and internal controls described in the report and it was a matter of grave concern that past employees and companies which had an association with Irish Rail may have been favoured in the procurement process.  At the Joint Committee on Transport meeting on the Baker Tilly report, I described the report as devastating in regard to the internal procurement processes up to 2006 and highlighted the responsibility of the chairperson of Irish Rail, Dr. John Lynch, and its chief executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The Baker Tilly report found that there had been a circumvention of procurement policies and procedures; people taking advantage of weak internal controls; a lack of trained staff; an absence of controls in the procurement department; the use of incorrect documentation in procurement transactions; non-compliance with procedures; the use of generic invoices which did not appear to refer to specific jobs; problems with budgeting in the infrastructural maintenance programme; the absence of supporting coding structures for track expenditure activity; problems with cost analysis and WBS codes; a lack of traceability; and a lack of the field key to link to the work taking place on the ground.  The Labour Party wants all the issues highlighted in the report to be fully and urgently addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Internal controls at Irish Rail should be greatly strengthened and I understand this process has commenced under the chief executive, Mr. Dick Fearn, and the newly appointed commercial manager.  In addition, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, Irish Rail and CIE must commit to formally report to Dáil Éireann and the Joint Committee on Transport with regular updates on the implementation of all the report's recommendations.  I supported the request for the Minister to appear before the joint committee on this matter and for the boards of CIE and Irish Rail to come before the joint committee with their respective auditing teams to enable the joint committee to make a report to the Oireachtas about what took place, as revealed to us in the Baker Tilly report.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">It must be acknowledged that CIE began the investigation into irregular procurement practices and commissioned the Baker Tilly report.  Moreover, in the pre-2002 policies, rail procurement policies were weak because Irish Rail had little to procure.  Until 2000, the company had a budget of only €16 million per annum for the maintenance of the entire rail network.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The National Roads Authority is another State agency which has received significant tranches of public money over the past decade.  Two issues, on which the Minister has refused to be accountable to the Dáil, remain a cause of concern in the NRA's remit, namely, tolling on the M50 and the administration of the Dublin Port tunnel.  The saga of the West Link bridge on the M50 has been one of the greatest scandals of this Government and the two Governments that preceded it.  In February 2007, my colleague, Deputy Shortall, estimated that the €600 million deal on the West Link toll bridge would, combined with profits already generated, deliver a return to National Toll Roads of an incredible 2,000% for a project which originally cost the company £38 million to build.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Many motorists were disgusted at hikes in toll charges and the difficulties caused by the new system, particularly for those who do not have access to computers, as well as numerous additional administrative charges imposed when the barrier free system was introduced.  Tag and video accounts have a range of extra charges, including account management charges, a deposit, minimum top-up requirements and charges for hard copy statements.  This week, it was reported that the National Roads Authority has collected €12 million in fines from motorists who failed to pay their toll charges on time.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">While I accept the NRA's bona fides on the need to iron out teething problems associated with barrier free tolling, it is unacceptable that the Minister, as far as I am aware, has consistently refused to answer any Labour Party questions in the Dáil on problems with barrier free tolling and the principle of tolling, despite 100,000 motorists being gravely affected by these problems every day.  Given the significant public health and safety issues which arose with the Dublin Port tunnel, it is also troubling that the Minister did not instigate a full review of all safety and systems procedures at the tunnel, as I requested at the time.  The matter has not yet been addressed in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The fundamental problem is the absence of accountability of Cabinet Ministers to Dáil Éireann for a range of semi-State agencies, companies and regulatory bodies within their remit.  The Office of Ceann Comhairle, certainly under the previous Ceann Comhairle, has been complicit in this matter by protecting Ministers from reasonable questions on public policy.  This problem has become more acute since 1997.</p>

          <p eId="para_754">Parliamentary questions to the Minister for Health and Children have always been batted away.  Many Opposition Deputies — I pay tribute to Deputy Durkan in this regard — have been upset by the practice of precluding Members from asking questions about policy, not to speak of the detailed issues of administration to which the Minister alluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The Minister for Transport is another serious Cabinet offender in ducking ministerial responsibilities.  Last Thursday, when taking questions in the Chamber, he again excelled himself by dodging a range of crucial questions I tried to ask him on behalf of my Labour Party colleagues.  They included questions on safety issues related to the €120 million motorway service station programme, including the decision to build only three such service stations, and on passenger safety and security on public transport.  Having refused to answer a question about the College Green bus gate, the Minister then had the cheek, at about ten o'clock last Thursday night, to start discussing the issue on the floor of the House and lecturing Labour Party councillors in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The Minister has also refused to discuss waiting lists for the national car test, proposals for the development of the aircraft maintenance industry, specifically a successor business to SR Technics, and dwindling aviation passenger volumes.  This morning, I had to ask the Taoiseach to request that the Minister come before the House to discuss the devastating cutbacks proposed at Aer Lingus.  The Minister will not discuss the travel departure tax, an issue he passed on to the Minister for Finance, or the roll-out of infrastructure for the national electric car programme, which he has passed to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who does not answer many questions in the House either.</p>

The current committee chaired by Deputy Bernard Allen has investigated a wide range of inappropriate and unacceptable uses of public moneys, including in FÁS and the Health Service Executive.  While the Committee of Public Accounts, a constitutional committee of 12 Deputies, including Deputy Shortall and me from the Labour Party, carries out this vital scrutiny role, it may not be the most appropriate forum for monitoring day-to-day activities at commercial companies such as Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Irish Rail.  It may be very difficult to try to invigilate the daily behaviour of a commercial company.</p>

          <p eId="para_784">We have also seen some appalling practices in private companies which have had a much wider impact on their employees.  For example, this morning Deputy Burton referred to companies such as Tesco and how they make pricing decisions.  Many famous companies such as Ryanair got good starts because they received certain public contracts.  It is not as simple as public or private companies.  Dáil accountability must be greatly enhanced and reform of the current committee system is a key element.  A number of Oireachtas committees undertake critical and essential work, include those on Finance and the Public Service, Transport and the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">It does not make sense to have a system of departmental committees unless we give them much stronger powers.  Departmental committees should at least have the same kind of powers as those of the Committee of Public Accounts, which is also looking for stronger powers.  The first Dáil of which I was a Member in the early 1990s had a committee on State-sponsored bodies which was chaired by the great former Deputy, Liam Kavanagh, and which was a very powerful body.  I recall it was the first committee at which we began to find out the wonderful salaries the leading presenters in RTE were paid.  It did some very good work.  On balance, the establishment of a committee on State-sponsored bodies with strong investigative powers might be a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">My Fine Gael colleagues highlighted the large subsidies CIE has received in the past 12 years.  Money allocated from the public purse must always be used in the most efficient way possible and be subject to the highest levels of accountability and transparency.  The Deloitte review showed us that Dublin Bus has a PSO of only 12%, which is one of the lowest public subsidies in Europe and is something I never hear my Fine Gael colleagues discussing.  Bus Éireann has a 12% subsidy.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">I thank the Labour Party and Deputy Broughan for sharing some of his time with me.  The old adage about the inch and the yard will not be forgotten by me again.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The need to ensure that accountability and transparency mechanisms are put in place to avoid the wastage of public money is absolutely critical.  When we are unable to get clarification from Government Ministers or under the Freedom of Information Act as to how moneys are being spent in CIE or the NRA, we are leaving the national transport network open to exploitation, abuse and criticism and it cannot be allowed to continue.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, indicated during the debate in the House on NAMA that he would consider trying to introduce a mechanism to allow him to be subject to parliamentary questions on NAMA.  It is currently a promise and has not yet happened, but, if such a system is introduced, it would leave some possibility of Government Departments returning to some level of real accountability in this House for their various portfolios.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">I support this motion, which proposes that a proper system of parliamentary oversight be introduced for CIE, the NRA and other agencies and semi-State companies which are in receipt of billions of euro of taxpayers' money.  It is important that we do not replicate the mistakes of State agencies such as FÁS across all State companies and bodies.  It is necessary to ensure at all times that such bodies are serving the interests of the public in a cost-effective way with no wastage.  CIE should be brought within the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman and that of the Comptroller and Auditor General and there should be no abdication of responsibility from the Government in disclosing important information to the public.  Taxpayers' money is funding these bodies, money which, in these times, is earned in sweat if not in blood in many cases.  Taxpayers are entitled to know how such money is being spent and that it is being used wisely.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">I am worried, a concern I share with Deputy Broughan, that this motion could be a wolf in sheep's clothing and that Fine Gael, a party which is a known proponent of the privatisation of public services, is using this opportunity to advance its own ideologies.  Deputy O'Dowd would never do that, but the party might.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">The lack of transparency and accountability should not be used to promote the privatisation of public transport, nor should transport contracts be opened up to competition.  Efficiency cannot be gained by snatching services from the people.  Experiences such as Aer Lingus and Eircom have shown that profit overrides the public need and given the current economic circumstance we are in, we cannot allow this to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">There is no reason that a competent, cost-effective transport system cannot be provided by the public sector.  While there is substantial scope for reform of oversight and transparency procedures to ensure that taxpayers' money is not being wasted frivolously, there is no rationale for the Fine Gael position regarding privatisation of services.  Looking for a quick buck to fill a hole in the public finances this way will seriously undermine public services in the future as contractors seek their own economic efficiencies, even to the point of leaving people standing at a bus stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">While a recent newspaper expose revealed a litany of abuses, including offences such as collusion, kick-backs and incompetence in CIE, the rotten core does not lie in the fact that this is a public asset.  Waving the magic wand of competition is hardly the only viable solution.  The culture of speculation, cronyism, scratching one's friend's back, poor governance and the lack of governmental and public oversight has brought us to this impasse.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">Regarding the Minister's reply to the question on the Freedom of Information Act, I accept his proposition that it would be a dangerous tool if it were opened completely to a semi-State body which is a commercial entity, as it would be to a non-commercial entity.  Similar to the Minister for Finance's example in regard to NAMA, which raises commercially sensitive issues to which he has promised to find a way around, devices could be employed which would allow important answers regarding the accountability and transparency of CIE to come under the scope of the Freedom of Information Act.  There is no reason that the Minister and his Department cannot devise such a system.  In fact, if he or his Department wish to have the advice of this side of the House, I am sure we will be more than willing to assist him in that endeavour.</p>

          <p eId="para_800">I ask the Minister for Health and Children to clarify matters causing confusion around the operation of the fair deal scheme as it operates with nursing homes and to allay fears that a transition will leave patients and their families without financial cover at that time.  Will the Minister clarify the uniformity of operation of the scheme through the HSE?  Patients have been told that they will not be covered under the scheme until assessments are complete, and then only from the date of approval, which by implication could cost them six weeks billing, which the patients and families may be unable to meet.  Will the Minister give direction in the matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_801">I am effectively asking the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the confusion surrounding the operation of the fair deal scheme and to allay fears that the transition from hospital to home will leave patients and their families without financial cover.  I am also asking her for clarity and uniformity to be applied in the operation of the scheme by the HSE.  Will she confirm that no patient admitted on a doctor's advice will have to wait until the medical assessment before proceeding?  If a discharged patient has to be readmitted after four months, will a previous approval be used?  This was the case when a patient was readmitted under the subvention scheme.  When a patient is admitted as an emergency to a nursing home, will the scheme apply from the time of the emergency, providing an application is lodged on the same day?</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Last week families in counties Roscommon and Leitrim had great difficulty in getting definitive information from the local HSE office.  A member of a family was treated for a serious illness in Sligo General Hospital and got two weeks of nursing home care under the winter initiative.  The patient was confined to bed and without a doubt needed full-time nursing home care.  When the family applied for nursing home subvention under the fair deal scheme, they were informed that financial assistance would not be available until medical assessment was carried out by the HSE medical team.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">They were also informed that cover would only commence from the date of approval following medical assessment, which could take weeks and result in a massive nursing home bill that the family would be unable to meet.  When I pointed out that the process could take several weeks I was told that under the new scheme, families will be liable for far more costs than under the subvention scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Will patients be able to transfer automatically from the subvention scheme to the fair deal scheme or will they have to be assessed again?  There is much confusion and many people in local areas are interpreting rules in different ways.  There is significant confusion.  When we contacted the Minister for Health and Children's office we were told there is no difficulty but on the ground there is much confusion.  Is the problem with the Department or in the way local offices are interpreting the rules?  The confusion must be cleared up.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children (Deputy Áine Brady)</from>
          <p eId="para_805">I thank Deputy Feighan for raising this issue, as it is important that matters such as this are completely understood so that potential applicants to the nursing homes support scheme can make fully informed decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">As the Deputy is aware, the nursing homes support scheme commenced on 27 October and the HSE is now processing applications under the scheme.  It is administered, and applications are processed, in accordance with the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 and the HSE's guidelines on the standardised implementation of the nursing homes support scheme, which were approved by the Minister for Health and Children.  This framework ensures a consistent approach across the HSE in the processing of applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The HSE has indicated that the expected timelines for processing applications and making a determination regarding financial support will vary according to individual circumstances and complexities.  However, on average, the following timelines are estimated in cases where the submitted application is fully and correctly completed: a straightforward application for State support should take one to two weeks and a straightforward application for ancillary State support, or the nursing home loan as it is commonly known, should take three to four weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">In the initial months following the introduction of the scheme, the HSE will have to deal with a large volume of applications from both existing residents and new entrants.  However, this should not impact negatively on existing residents due to the safeguards provided within the primary legislation.  The legislation provides that applicants to the scheme who were in nursing home care on the date the scheme commenced shall have their State support backdated to that date.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">Furthermore, anyone in receipt of subvention prior to the commencement of the scheme will continue to have that paid while their application is being processed.  Once the application has been determined, the backdated State support will be netted off against the subvention already paid.  In practice, what this means is that people will not be paid twice for the same care but will have State support paid from 27 October 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">For new entrants to nursing home care, the HSE's guidelines on the standardised implementation of the scheme state that subject to overall resources, people who enter nursing homes after the commencement of the scheme will have their financial support paid either from the date that the application was made or from date of admission to the nursing home, whichever is the later.  At this point I emphasise that the scheme is voluntary and is underpinned by an important commitment that anyone who was in a nursing home when the scheme commenced cannot be made worse off by its introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">Such individuals can choose whether to transfer to the new scheme.  Therefore, anyone who was in a public or voluntary nursing home, or in a contracted bed in a private nursing home when the scheme commenced, can continue with their existing arrangements.  Anyone who was in an approved private nursing home and in receipt of subvention when the scheme commenced can choose to transfer to the nursing homes support scheme or retain current subvention arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">If a person is in a private nursing home which is not approved for the purpose of the scheme, he or she can retain current subvention arrangements or opt to apply for the scheme and change to a nursing home participating in the scheme.  A list of the nursing homes participating in the scheme is available on the HSE website.  Finally, if a person was in an approved private nursing home when the new scheme commenced, he or she does not need to apply for a care needs assessment; instead, the person can commence the process by applying for the financial assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">I hope this explanation has clarified the issues raised by Deputy Feighan.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_814">I firmly believe we need legislation to ensure that professional and corporate lobbyists are obliged to be registered, and that the lobbying industry would be regulated.  We saw the extraordinary scenario in the not too distant past in the Flood and Mahon tribunal that showed how a lobbyist extraordinaire, Frank Dunlop, virtually corrupted an entire planning process in the capital city of this country.  Public representatives were bribed, as were council officials.  In the Moriarty tribunal we saw how large portions of money were given to individuals, particularly to political representatives, for nefarious purposes and that undermined the democratic process.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">We have a responsibility to ensure our house is in order and that the entire political establishment is above reproach.  One way to do this is by having appropriate legislation in place so that anybody engaged in lobbying public representatives for planning, ministerial decisions or any other activity must be properly registered and their activities regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">That is not the case at present.  There is no regulation or register of lobbyists in this country and anybody can operate with impunity in the area.  The Labour Party tried to address the issue in 1999 when we introduced a Registration of Lobbyists Bill in the Seanad.  It was a colleague of ours, Pat Gallagher, who was then a Senator and had earlier been a Deputy, who introduced the first piece of legislation.  When that was rejected we tried again in 2003, 2005 and 2008.  On all occasions, Fianna Fáil-led Governments rejected the attempt to put the registration and regulation of lobbyists on a statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The first programme for Government of the present coalition, which was agreed by the Green Party and Fianna Fáil two and a half years ago, included a provision to give a statutory basis to the regulation of lobbyists.  Nothing has happened over the last two and a half years, however.  The most recent version of the programme for Government, which was signed by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party a couple of weeks ago, contains the bare statement that "we will introduce a Register of Lobbyists, including professional, corporate and NGO".  If it is lucky, the Government will have two and a half years to deliver on that promise.  That is the maximum period it will have.  It will test the mettle of the Green Party, which loudly proclaimed when it was in Opposition that it intended to provide for an ethical basis for politics across the board.  It now has an opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, to clearly state whether legislation is being prepared at present.  Two and a half years have gone by without an inkling of any legislation.  A fresh commitment has been made.  I would welcome a commitment to introduce legislation at an early stage so that it can be debated properly.  If we are to ensure that the profession of politics is strengthened, we need to put in place a statutory basis which ensures that those who might engage in lobbying, for one reason or another, have to abide by proper regulations and sign up to a register of lobbyists.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AineBrady" eId="spk_350">
          <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_819">I will respond to this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.  I thank Deputy Costello for raising this issue.  Ireland has built up a wide range of instruments, aimed at improving transparency and ethical behaviour in public life, over recent years.  I refer to the Freedom of Information Acts, the ethics legislation and the various codes of conduct, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Lobbying is a legal and necessary element of the dynamics of a democracy.  The development of policy should respond to influence and to the views of those affected by it.  It is important that such influence is open and transparent.  The renewed programme for Government contains a commitment to the introduction of a register of lobbyists, including professional, corporate and non-governmental organisations.  The challenge is to ensure that a register suits our circumstances.  In the normal course of events, lobbying and the making of representations are healthy and welcome activities.  Citizens, interest groups and businesses engage in lobbying to communicate their legitimate preferences to decision-makers.  A variety of consultative mechanisms have been put in place, by means of legislation and practice, to provide for comprehensive inputs to policy development and implementation to be made.  The work of lobbyists must be seen in this wider context.  The Government and the Civil Service do not have all the answers.  We need to be informed by outside views from industry, environmental non-governmental organisations and private citizens.  It is natural that, from time to time, concerns will be raised as to whether undue influence is being brought to bear.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">Many democracies have introduced systems to register professional lobbyists.  Some countries, such as the United States, have complex and long-standing systems of regulation and oversight.  Other jurisdictions rely on voluntary systems of regulation.  A limited number of public relations companies in Ireland carry out lobbying work on a fee basis.  I estimate that fewer than 30 public relations companies carry out an element of lobbying as a subset of their other public relations activities.  Certain non-governmental organisations, former parliamentarians and political advisers and legal firms are also involved in lobbying on behalf of their clients.  Ireland has a particularly open political system.  Deputies and Ministers meet individuals and interest groups frequently during their day-to-day business and at their constituency clinics.  We have operated a wide form of social partnership across the public sector.  Our system lends itself to easy and free access to decision makers.  While that is a good thing, it brings about a challenge in terms of regulation.  An OECD report, Building a Legislative Framework for Enhancing Transparency and Accountability in Lobbying, recognises that a country's lobbying practices are deeply embedded in its democratic and constitutional setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The Government's policy challenge is to provide for effective regulation that is appropriate to Ireland's national circumstances and designed to capture our open system, without putting an unnecessary administrative drain on public resources.  In considering such a system, the principles of regulatory impact assessment suggest that regulation must be necessary, effective, consistent and proportional.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is considering these issues on behalf of the Government, in line with the commitment in the renewed programme for Government.  He intends that his Department will constructively explore options with representatives of the lobbying industry to make progress with the most appropriate approach to the introduction of a register.</p>

            <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
            <p eId="para_823">I welcome the common sense approach that was adopted by the Minister for Education and Science in his recent press release on prefabricated classrooms.  The construction of permanent classrooms makes sense in terms of immediate and long-term planning.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, said in the press release, which was issued on 19 October last, that he has "allowed schools to use grant aid for the purchase of prefabs to build permanent classrooms and if a prefab is needed for more than three years the department will offer a school a grant to buy it rather than to rent it".  St. Oliver's national school in Ballycasheen, Killarney, is paying an annual fee of €81,000 to rent prefabricated classrooms.  It has embarked on a programme of building permanent classrooms and will shortly complete a permanent extension.  However, it continues to have to accommodate over 100 pupils in prefabricated units, which have been on site since the 2006-07 school year, at an annual rental cost of €81,000.  As the enrolment of the school has grown from 410 in 2001 to 672 at present, the classroom space provided by the prefabs will continue to be required into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">The management of St. Oliver's national school would like to know how it can apply for additional funding to buy the prefabricated units, rather than having to continue spending €81,000 per annum to rent them.  It would welcome the provision of further funds to enable the school to purchase the units, or build further permanent classrooms, and thereby cease paying rent.  The construction of further permanent classrooms would represent a longer-term accommodation solution and stimulate employment in the local economy.  Given that astronomical amounts of money are being wasted on prefabs in County Kerry and elsewhere in the country, I compliment the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe on his common sense and worthwhile endeavours in this regard.  The Minister has chosen the right time to harness the changes in development and construction costs.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, to state whether funding will be made available to St. Oliver's national school to enable it to buy the prefabs it is currently renting at a cost of €81,000 per annum.  Perhaps she can clarify how the school authorities should go about acquiring them.</p>

          <speech by="#AineBrady" eId="spk_352">
            <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
            <p eId="para_825">I propose to respond to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to outline to the Dáil the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and the current position in respect of St. Oliver's national school in Ballycasheen, Killarney.  The modernisation of facilities in our existing building stock, like the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  As part of this process, each project is assigned a band rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects, which were devised following consultation with the education partners.  In the case of St. Oliver's national school in Ballycasheen, the school has a current staffing level of a principal, 23 mainstream teachers, one developing post, four special class teachers, one post for administration-deputy principal, three resource teachers for Travellers and five language support teachers.  It also has the services of ten learning support-resource teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">In April 2005 the school submitted an application to the Department for capital funding towards the provision of an extension to include three classrooms for children with mild learning difficulties, a principal's office, refurbishment of the staff room area and five partitioned rooms.  The application was assessed and the project was assigned a band rating of 1.2.  As it was not possible to progress the project in time to meet the need presenting, it was necessary to provide temporary accommodation to the school.  As the Deputy may be aware, it is open to school authorities to apply for temporary accommodation to meet any immediate accommodation needs that might arise.  All applications for such additional accommodation are subject to a full and thorough assessment process.  As part of that assessment process, the rental of a prefabricated classroom, the purchase of a prefabricated classroom and the building of a permanent structure are all considered as possible solutions in addressing a school's accommodation issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">In the case of existing temporary accommodation a similar exercise would be carried out where the rental agreements are due to expire or be renewed.  The purchase of a prefabricated classroom and the building of a permanent structure, in particular, may address a school's accommodation issues in the medium to long term and can be facilitated by means of a devolved grant.  In an effort to limit the increasing number of prefab units being rented by schools, in July 2008 the Minister decided that where additional accommodation was needed by schools and the need was for three or more years, schools should have the option of purchasing prefab units or building new rooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">I am pleased to say that in 2008 St. Oliver's received approval for devolved grants relating to two separate projects to purchase or build an 80 sq. m mainstream classroom, a 100 sq. m mainstream classroom and a 50 sq. m resource room.  I understand from the school that one of these projects is completed, and the other is under construction and should be completed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">The school is also renting prefabricated units pending provision of permanent accommodation.  Regarding balance of the accommodation to be provided at St. Oliver's national school, the progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.  The project for St. Oliver's national school will continue to be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the current position regarding the school building project for St. Oliver's national school, Ballycasheen, Killarney, County Kerry.</p>

          <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_353">
            <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
            <p eId="para_831">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  I welcome that the Minister of State spoke about devolved grants which are extremely important for many of the smaller schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">Monaghan Model school is one of a small number of Model schools throughout the country which was in place at the foundation of the State.  The school is a listed building and is therefore of great importance architecturally in Monaghan town.  However, the most important fact is that the last major improvements and repairs were carried out to this school in 1984.  Since then some smaller Protestant schools were closed and amalgamated with the Model school so pupil numbers increased.  In 1990 an application was made for the provision of a general purpose room.  In 1992 architects from the Department of Education visited and assessed the existing structure and made proposals to the Department which was to appoint specialist architects to make further assessments.  This assessment team was not appointed until the summer of 2001 when it met the then chairperson and principal of the school.  The architects again visited the school in November 2001 and by December 2002 the building project was agreed and was placed at architectural stage, which is stage 2.  It was May 2008 before stage 3 plans were approved and as yet in spite of numerous requests no more commitments have been made by the Department or the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">There are 136 pupils of ten different nationalities on the roll.  There are five mainstream teachers plus a learning support teacher, a language support teacher and a resource teacher.  There are five mainstream classrooms and the Minister of State would need to see these to understand how limited the space is.  The other room is divided to create learning support and language support.  The room — corridor really — linking the office to the main school is divided to create a resource teaching area.  There is one staff room which serves as a general office, teacher resource library, store room for art materials, PE room for junior classes on a wet day and meeting room for the parents association and board of management.  The office is shared by a secretary and principal, and is used for medical visits and for meeting individual parents and so on.  There is no kitchen as there is nowhere to fit one and the corridors are used for storage.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">This is totally unacceptable.  The project is ready to go and all the board of management needs is the funding to take the project forward.  The school enrolment is still increasing but the principal must now refuse to take extra names because resources are really getting to breaking point.  Physical space is simply not available and there are serious health and safety issues.  In the current financial situation, I understand how difficult it is to commit money to projects.  However, as this is a listed building there will be a great deal of employment involved to do the job properly and I humbly suggest it would be better value for money to pay people to restructure this school for the future education of our young people than to pay people for doing nothing on social welfare.  This would give much-needed employment to a very depressed industry and the Department of Education and Science should be able to get much better value for money now than if this project had been started three years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">This school in spite of the limitations of the building structure has an exceptionally high record in the delivery of high-quality education and there is always demand for places in it as can be illustrated by the fact that it caters for ten different nationalities.  This in turn creates special needs in the context of language support and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">The chairperson, board and principal of this school are extremely frustrated to see and hear of so many other schools being dealt with and it is hard to explain to them why their project has not been dealt with.  The school can hardly be accused of jumping the queue when its last works were completed in the 1984 and this application was made in 1990.  Whenever the work is carried out, pupils and teachers will have to move the school, in every sense of the word, to alternative accommodation.  It was the board's understanding that it was to receive the funds two years ago and to that end it made an agreement with Monaghan Harps GAA club to provide a site to accommodate alternative structures.  This opportunity may not be there for ever and other accommodation may be difficult to find.  This is a health and safety issue.  There is extreme disappointment with the chairperson, board and principal of the school that their project has been left out and I urge the Minister to deal with this situation immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">The board received a holding letter which effectively asked it to do nothing further about the project otherwise funds would not be found for it.  I could say much more if I had time.  It is an urgent issue.  I appreciate the Minister of State is not directly in charge of this area.  However, I know her influence with the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and I hope she will use that.</p>

            <p eId="para_838">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects as well as the current position in regard to the school referred to by Deputy Crawford, namely, the Model school in Monaghan town.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">Modernising facilities in the Department's existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth are significant challenges.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The Department's forward planning section has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at primary and post-primary levels in the coming years.  This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.  The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in 42 selected locations throughout the State, based on significant changes to the demographic profile of those areas.  Monaghan town is not one of these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">The forward planning section is currently in the process of carrying out an analysis of each of these locations to identify the school accommodation requirements up to and including the school year 2014-15.  When the required reports have been completed for these initial selected areas, the section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country, which will include the Monaghan area.  The school referred to by Deputy Crawford currently has a project in architectural planning to extend and refurbish the existing school.  The refurbishment project has been assigned a band 2.6 rating.  It is at an advanced stage of architectural planning and a stage 2(a) submission was approved by the Department in March of this year.  In issuing that approval, the Department also confirmed approval for an increased floor area for the proposed extension.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">The level of demand on the school building programme is such that all projects cannot be carried out together but must be carried out over time in a structured and coherent manner.  That is the reasoning behind the Department's published prioritisation criteria.  The progression of all large-scale building projects, including the project for the Model school in Monaghan town, is dependent on prioritisation of the competing demands on the Department's capital budget.  The building project for Monaghan's Model school will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme for 2010 and subsequent years.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and assure him that the Minister is committed to advancing the project when resources permit.</p>

            <p eId="para_844">The budget for the Garda Ombudsman Commission is provided from the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">The budget for the Garda Ombudsman Commission for 2008 was €11.645 million.  During the supplementary estimates process for that year savings of approximately €1.8 million were identified yielding a final outturn figure of €9.845 million for 2008.  Savings arose in 2008 for a number of reasons including, deferral of proposed works on the Garda Ombudsman Commission's accommodation, savings achieved in the purchase of IT software and IT training and legal costs being less than originally anticipated.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">The budget for the Garda Ombudsman Commission for 2009 is €11.058 million.  The 2009 outturn is expected to be on a par with 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">As the Deputy will be aware, a significant reduction in public expenditure for 2009 and 2010 must be achieved. No area can expect to escape the impact of these cuts.  Next year's budget for the Garda Ombudsman Commission is still being considered in the context of the preparation of the 2010 estimates for the wider Justice Vote.  At this stage I am not in a position to give a figure in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_849">It is important when examining prison statistics to bear in mind that at any time approximately 90% of the sentenced prison population is of Irish nationality. In relation to the question raised, I wish to inform the Deputy that on 6 November 2009 there were 538 non-Irish nationals in custody, including 98 on remand.  This represented 13% of the prisoner population on that day.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">In 2008 non-Irish nationals accounted for approximately 30% of all committals to prisons.  This was down on 2007 when non-Irish nationals accounted for approximately 34% of all committals to prisons.  A profile of prisoners committed in 2008 shows that 2% were from the UK, 11.2% were EU citizens, 2.5% were other Europeans, 6.9% were African, 4.7% were Asian, 1.7% were from South America and 0.2% were North American.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">The 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which is provided for in Irish legislation by virtue of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts, 1995 and 1997 provides a mechanism whereby non-nationals serving sentences in Ireland may apply to serve the remainder of their sentences in their own countries. The policy of the Convention, which is based on humanitarian considerations, is to overcome the difficulties posed for prisoners serving sentences in foreign jurisdictions, such as absence of contact with relatives and differences in languages and culture.  In this regard, it has been long established Government policy that, whenever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families. Such transfers may be facilitated where the home state of the foreign prisoner has ratified the Convention.  The consent of all three parties in the process is required prior to any transfer, i.e. the sentencing state, the receiving state and the sentenced person.  I decide on all such requests following the collation of a number of reports from various agencies setting out the consequences of such a transfer.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">The "Council of the European Union Framework Decision on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving the deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the EU" was recently adopted. It arises from a proposal by Austria, Sweden and Finland to revise the 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">The primary purpose of this new Framework Decision is to build greater efficiency into the transfer process. The Framework Decision has been the subject of extensive negotiation at various levels within the EU in which Ireland has played an active and constructive part. However, unlike the 1983 Convention, which has international participation beyond the territory of the EU, the scope of this Framework Decision will apply only to EU Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">The principal changes from the 1983 Council of Europe Convention involve the removal of the requirement for the consent of the prisoner and a modification of the requirement for the consent of the receiving state in certain circumstances in order for a transfer to proceed, primarily where the prisoner is a national of the other EU State and is normally resident in that State.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">My Department is currently making the necessary preparations to comply with our obligation to make provision for this new mechanism in domestic legislation by December 2011.</p>

The guidelines under which these operated were amended in the light of the experience gained in their operation.  On 24 September, 2008 I launched, with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the amended guidelines providing for the establishment of Committees in all 114 local authority areas by the relevant local authorities and the Garda Commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">I am informed by the Garda authorities that, up to the end of October 2009, Committees had been established in 93 local authority areas, representing 82% of the total.

The process of establishing a Committee can take some time since it is necessary to select Committee members from the elected local authority members, Oireachtas members who have expressed an interest in becoming members and the community and voluntary sector in accordance with the procedures set out in the guidelines and local arrangements.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_870">I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 30 September 2009, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the personnel strength of each Garda Division is set out in the table which I am circulating with this answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">In accordance with the provisions of the Garda Síochána Acts 2005 to 2007 proposals, <i>inter alia</i>, to alter the boundaries of a divisional geographical area are a matter in the first instance for the Garda Commissioner in the context of the Annual Policing Plan.  The 2008 Policing Plan, which was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, contained the Commissioner’s proposals to realign Garda boundaries in a number of areas around the country to make them coterminous with the functional boundaries of local authorities.  The boundary changes will bring about greater efficiencies and effectiveness in facilitating the establishment and functioning of Joint Policing Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">A Programme Board was established by the Garda Síochána and chaired by an Assistant Commissioner to oversee the implementation.  In addition, Project Boards chaired by the local Divisional officer, were established in each Division to develop tailored implementation plans.  The relevant Project Boards, on which the staff associations are represented, are managing all tasks associated with each individual rollout.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">Significant progress has been made to date commencing with the creation of new Divisions e.g. Louth, Wicklow and Roscommon/Longford and the rollout of re-aligned divisional boundaries across all the regions.</p>

These figures include the purchase of new vehicles in addition to the maintenance, repair and fuel required for the existing fleet. For the period mentioned by the Deputy almost €72m has been expended on the Garda fleet.  In addition, in 2006 a major capital injection was made with the purchase of over 1,300 new vehicles at a cost of over €28.6m.  This has enabled both the expansion of the fleet as well as lowering the age profile.   Since September 2006 the size of the fleet has increased from 2,247 to 2,820 — an increase of 25%.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_361">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_937">I presume the Deputy is referring to a new approach developed for Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) which is currently in the process of being implemented. This new approach was developed by the Irish Youth justice Service (IYJS) as a result of an analysis of projects which was carried out in 2008 and published earlier this year. The report on the findings, entitled "Designing effective local responses to youth crime" was drawn up to fulfil a key objective of the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010, which was approved by Government in early 2008. Both of these documents are available on www.iyjs.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">Improving the effectiveness of diversionary measures is a key objective of this strategy and this report makes recommendations for the development of  existing projects. The IYJS is working in partnership with An Garda Síochána in this endeavour.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">These projects are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved (or further involved) in anti-social and/or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda/community relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">The first two GYDPs were established in Dublin in 1991 and they have expanded gradually over the intervening years to reach the current figure of 100. Essentially they provide a resource to An Garda Síochána, and to Juvenile Liaison Officers in particular, in the implementation of the Diversion Programme as set out in Part 4 of the Children Act 2001. The dispersal of GYDPs across the country and their gradual expansion through a variety of youth organisations and local community groups resulted in a varied approach across projects to their crime prevention objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">The report outlines three specific improvement measures for GYDPs:</p>
            <p eId="para_942">1. Improved alignment of project activities with local youth crime patterns;</p>
            <p eId="para_943">2. Improved service design and development, to be implemented initially in five of the projects on a trial basis; and</p>
            <p eId="para_944">3. Improved knowledge and capacity across all Projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">In addition, projects will be required to submit a detailed annual business plan which includes:</p>
            <p eId="para_946">an analysis of the youth crime patterns in the project catchments area; and</p>
            <p eId="para_947">a subsequent statement setting out how the project's proposed activities will impact on youth crime in the catchments area.</p>

         the reason existing by-laws that prohibit the public consumption of alcohol in public places are not rigidly enforced in view of the fact that groups of young people and older men regularly congregate and drink under canal bridges in areas (details supplied) in County Dublin creating antisocial behaviour including public drug taking.

            <p eId="para_951">The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 introduced tougher public order provisions, allowing the Gardaí to seize alcohol from persons who are under 18 and to seize alcohol where they have a reasonable apprehension of public disorder or damage to property and require a person to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner.  Provision was also made to issue fixed charge notices for certain offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">One of the strategic goals of An Garda Síochána is to reduce significantly the incidence of public disorder and anti-social behaviour in communities.  This is achieved by developing a specific public order policing strategy based on frequency of incident type, location, time and day analysis and to develop and deploy a strategic, area-specific policing strategy to manage the night-time economy and reduce the fear associated with alcohol-related public disorder.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">I attach a high importance to the achievement of the maximum levels of safety for local communities, in particular through the tackling of problems resulting from the misuse of alcohol.  This is reiterated in the Renewed Programme for Government, which contains a specific commitment that we will continue to target Garda actions within communities experiencing significant anti-social behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">I am confident that the restrictions on the availability and visibility of alcohol provided for in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, along with the provisions for more effective enforcement to deal with the consequences of alcohol abuse in particular anti-social behaviour, will contribute to bringing about more responsible behaviour on the part of those concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_962">The Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and children and sets out an incremental procedure for addressing such behaviour.

            <p eId="para_965">I wish to inform the Deputy that I am aware of the recent submission.  Overcrowding in prisons is an international problem and is not unique to Ireland.  The Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and does not have the option of refusing committals.  It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 330.  This represents a 9% rise in the number in custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">Since 1997, the Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure.  This has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  There are contingency plans in place in all of our prisons to deal with peak population numbers.  A new accommodation block for 123 prisoners recently opened at Castlerea Prison.  Furthermore, current projects will also provide the potential for an additional 750 prison spaces during 2009 and 2010 by means of:</p>
            <p eId="para_967">a new block in Portlaoise Prison which will have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners and has started to accommodate prisoners;</p>
            <p eId="para_968">a new block in Wheatfield Prison which will also have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners and is due to open by the end of 2009;</p>
            <p eId="para_969">opening the separation unit in Mountjoy Prison which will have the potential to accommodate 50 prisoners and is due to open by the end of this month;</p>
            <p eId="para_970">a new wing at the Portlaoise/Midlands Prisons complex will have the potential to accommodate 300 prisoners.  Work is due to commence in early 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">Despite this significant investment, it is quite clear that in some of our prisons we are operating in excess of our bed capacity at this time.  In the longer term, the Government remains firmly committed to replacing the largely 19th Century prison buildings on the Mountjoy complex with modern prison accommodation at Thornton Hall.  Building new prison facilities at Thornton Hall on a green field site will open up new opportunities for the development of structured regime activities that support rehabilitation and resettlement of prisoners.  In developing its design concept for Thornton Hall the Irish Prison Service sought and continues to seek to deliver a modern, operationally efficient and cost effective facility which will provide decent living conditions for prisoners with appropriate support programmes including the provision of  modern facilities for prison staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">The new facilities at Thornton Hall will, in addition, offer significant improvements in the areas of work training, education and medical services as well as providing predominantly single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation facilities.  These are major undertakings involving replacement of close to 40% of the entire prison estate.  They will take a number of years to complete but it is my intention that they will proceed as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_974">An effective police civilianisation programme does not always involve pure "one for one" replacement of individual Gardaí with civilians — it can take a number of forms. Firstly, of course there is the replacement of sworn members, who are engaged in exclusively clerical, administrative or technical duties, with civilian staff. Secondly, and very importantly there is the use of civilian support which allows sworn members who would otherwise have to devote a significant part of their working day to performing some administrative duties to focus exclusively on front-line policing duties. Thirdly, there is the recruitment of civilians to perform completely new or expanded administrative, managerial and professional support roles in An Garda Síochána, for example, as crime analysts or IT specialists.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">On this account, and because of the significant restructuring of roles, functions and business areas that has taken place at all levels of An Garda Síochána in recent years, it is very difficult to quantify the exact number of posts which were occupied by sworn members but which today are held by civilians. I can however confirm that since 2003 the number of civilians in An Garda Síochána has more than doubled to approximately 2,115 whole time equivalents. Civilian staff are now involved in the provision of vital support services in a wide range of administrative, professional, technical and industrial areas, including Human Resources, Training &amp; Development, IT and Telecommunications, Finance and Procurement, Internal Audit, Communications, research and analysis, accommodation and fleet management, scene-of-crime support and medical services.  In addition, a number of essential operational support areas, having throughout their history been almost exclusively manned by Gardaí, are now wholly or largely staffed by civilian staff, such as the Central Vetting Unit, the Garda Information Services Centre which is based in Castlebar and which operates the Pulse System, and the Fixed Charge Processing Office.  The Garda Síochána Analysis Service, to which I referred earlier, is staffed by qualified and highly trained civilian analysts and civilian Telecommunications Technicians provide front-line support to the whole of the Garda organisation across a range of technologies and services.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">I wish to inform the Deputy that on 6 November 2009 there were 644 prisoners on temporary release. This represented 14% of the overall prisoner population for that day.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">In contrast, the equivalent percentage of prisoners on temporary release for the years 1994 to 1997 was as follows: 1994 — (22.2%), 1995 — (20.2%), 1996 — (17.9%) and 1997 — (19.2%).</p>
            <p eId="para_979">The highest number of prisoners on temporary release on any one date in 2009 was 686 on 24 June 2009. This represented 15% of the overall population on that date.  The daily average figure to date in 2009 for prisoners on temporary release is 510 and this represents 12% of the daily population figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003, provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to well-behaved prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">Temporary release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence. Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and do not have the option of refusing committals. It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years. This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 330. This represents an 9 % rise in the number in custody.</p>

            <p eId="para_992">I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government attaches the highest priority to tackling serious crime and bringing those involved in such activities to justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">An Garda Síochána undertakes a number of multi-agency activities designed to target and disrupt the operations of criminal organisations. The targeting of those involved in serious crime is done in a number of ways, including through the use of focused intelligence led operations by specialist units such as the Organised Crime Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">In addition the Government has in recent times introduced an extensive suite of criminal justice legislation containing a range of new provisions targeted at those engaged in serious crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">These measures include provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Acts of 2006 and 2007, in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 and in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 is a very new piece of legislation aimed at tackling serious crimes but I can assure the House that An Garda Síochána are already actively making use of the provisions in this Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that given the seriousness of the offences being dealt with under this legislation that a full and thorough investigation of individuals and their activities must be conducted before charges can be brought against them. Therefore it is too early at this stage to provide details as sought by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">Finally in relation to bail issues the Government today has agreed to my proposal to commence work on a new Bail Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_1002">The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts, 1995 and 1997 provide a mechanism whereby non-nationals serving sentences in Ireland may apply to serve the remainder of their sentences in their own countries, where those countries are party to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  Similarly, Irish persons who are imprisoned overseas in such countries may apply to serve the remainder of their sentences in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">The Convention is open to States outside Europe and the Government supports the Council of Europe policy of encouraging states to ratify and operate the Convention. There are over sixty states operating the Convention at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">The policy of the Convention, which is based on humanitarian considerations, is to overcome the difficulties posed for prisoners serving sentences in foreign jurisdictions, such as absence of contact with relatives and differences in languages and culture.  In this regard, it has been long established Government policy that, whenever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">All applications for transfer are subject to a three way consent mechanism; that of the applicant, the sentencing state and the receiving state.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">It should be noted, however, that, even where all of the conditions are satisfied, there is no obligation on a State to comply with a transfer request.</p>

            <p eId="para_1021">The new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin will have a design capacity of 1,400 with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 offenders in a range of security settings. The revised plan for the new prison campus aims to protect the taxpayers' interests and provide good quality, regime focused accommodation and programmes to prepare offenders for reintegration back into society, on a scale that cannot currently be delivered at Mountjoy Prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">The development is proceeding on a phased basis with phase one comprising essential preliminary works required for the prison development including the construction of a dedicated access route, perimeter wall and related services. The tender documentation and scope of works for this phase of the project is well advanced. It is anticipated that the preliminary works tender documentation will be issued to the market early in the New Year. While the essential preliminary work in phase one is in progress the procurement process for the buildings and other facilities that will make up the new prison campus will be examined and finalised in accordance with Department of Finance public procurement guidelines.  The objective is to complete the procurement process for the main prison complex while the construction of phase one work is underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">The development of the new prison campus at Thornton Hall is a complex project which is governed by Department of Finance and EU procurement guidelines. These guidelines set out a range of actions that must take place prior to inviting tender for the project. The Irish Prison Service with the assistance of the National Development Finance Agency is in the process of finalising the various preparatory steps prior to inviting tenders for the construction of the prison. It is intended to issue the tender documentation for the construction of the prison next year.  Construction and fitting out of the prison will take two to three years from the date of signature of a contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">In relation to expenditure on the project to a total of €41.9 million has been expended on the project to end October, 2009. This sum includes site cost of €29.9 million. The cost of the site was largely offset by the sale of surplus prison lands at Shanganagh, County Dublin. An additional 8.7 acres has also been acquired at a cost of €1.3m to provide a dedicated access route to the prison. This was done following representations from the local community which reflected concern in relation to effect of increased traffic generated by the prison development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">A total of €10.7 million has been expended on professional fees (€7 million), site preparation and surveys (€2.8m), landscaping (€0.4 million) and security (€0.5 million). As is the case with all major infrastructure projects a comprehensive set of geological, engineering and archaeological surveys have been undertaken and these surveys will help to reduce the overall construction programme once a contract for the construction of the prison is awarded.</p>

            <p eId="para_1029">As the Deputy is aware the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) is a statutory body which operates under the Proceeds of Crime Acts 1996 and 2005 (as amended). Under the provisions of this legislation CAB may apply to the High Court to obtain either an interim or interlocutory order to freeze certain assets it believes to be the proceeds of criminal activity. If the High Court is satisfied that such assets are the proceeds of crime then they may be frozen for a period of at least seven years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1030">The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 introduced provisions whereby all relevant parties can consent to the application of Section 4A Order to allow for a disposal order to be made by the High Court before the seven year period  has elapsed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">When the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 was being debated, the Oireachtas considered the issue of reducing the standard seven year waiting period to a minimum three year period. However at that stage it was decided to retain the current timeframe of seven years, on the basis that reducing the period between the interlocutory order and the disposal order might result in the legislation being more open to challenge in terms of due process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">However, I have asked my officials, together with the Criminal Assets Bureau, to review the legislation relating to the length of time an asset must be held before it can be disposed of, particularly in relation to certain types of assets which may be disposed of before they depreciate significantly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1035">As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and does not have the option of refusing committals. It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years. This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 330. This represents an 9% rise in the number in custody. On 6 November 2009 there were 3,998 prisoners in custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">Since 1997, the Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces. A new accommodation block for 123 prisoners recently opened at Castlerea Prison. Furthermore, current projects will also provide the potential for an additional 750 prison spaces during 2009 and 2010 by means of:</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">a new block in Portlaoise Prison which will have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners and which has recently started to accommodate prisoners;</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">a new block in Wheatfield Prison which will also have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners which is due to open by end of 2009;</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">opening the separation unit in Mountjoy Prison which will have the potential to accommodate 50 prisoners due to open by end of this month;</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">a new wing at the Portlaoise/Midlands complex will have the potential to accommodate 300 prisoners. Work is due to commence in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">In the longer term, the Government remains firmly committed to replacing the prisons on the Mountjoy complex with modern prison accommodation at Thornton Hall. Building new prison facilities at Thornton Hall on a green field site will open up new opportunities for the development of structured regime activities that support rehabilitation and resettlement of prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">It is acknowledged that drugs present a major challenge to the Irish Prison Service and in this context, the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy and Strategy, entitled <i>Keeping Drugs out of Prison </i>was launched in May 2006<i>.</i>  The implementation of this Policy and Strategy has seen an intensification of efforts in the prison system to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within prisons including:</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">Tighter control and monitoring of prisoner visits in all closed prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">New visiting arrangements in most closed prisons, with visitors required to be pre-approved by the Governor and required to provide identification on each visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">Greater use of screened visits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">Greater vigilance in examining mail by prison censors and searching of other items entering the prison.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">Increased random searching of cells and their occupants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">Stricter searching of all persons committed to custody and prisoners returning from court, temporary release, after visits or on receipt of intelligence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">Use of modern cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, under floor boards and other cavities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">Installation of nets over exercise yards to prevent access to contraband items, including mobile phones and drugs. Use of phone detectors and phased installation of telephone blocking technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">In addition, a number of new security initiatives have been introduced in all closed prisons including:</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">The introduction of enhanced security screening for all persons (visitors and staff) entering our prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">The establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving approximately 30 handling teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">The establishment of Operational Support Units dedicated to and developing expertise in searching and gathering intelligence on illicit material being hidden inside our prisons; they will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific security problem areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">The Body Orifice Security Scanner (BOSS) chair was introduced by the Irish Prison Service in early 2008 and to date eight chairs have been installed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">The new security screening at prison entrances and the measures introduced have had considerable success in preventing the flow of and assisting in the capture of contraband such as illicit drugs. The battle will be an ongoing one in which I an determined to take whatever practical measures are possible to thwart illegal activity. There will be no easing off in relation to the security measures already in place and that enhancements and improvements will continue to take place in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">As the Inspector of Prison states in his recently published 2008 Annual Report, the new security measures have significantly impacted upon the availability of drugs in prison.  However, the reality is that as long as there is drug misuse in the community this will be inevitably reflected in a prison setting.  That said, the Irish Prison Service continues to work to implement its Drugs Policy and Strategy, which also includes continued investment in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting prisoners' treatment and rehabilitative needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1061">I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of the latest date for which figures are readily available, the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána was 14,716.  This figure includes 1,098 probationer Gardaí who have been attested and will graduate over the next six months.  On that date there also were 326 unattested students in training. A total of 200 students — 100 in February and 100 in May — were inducted into the Garda College in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">In relation to retirements, a total of 708 members of the Force have retired or declared their intention to retire, either voluntarily or on age grounds, in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">The moratorium on Public Service recruitment, introduced in May 2009, applies to Garda recruitment. I intend to keep the position under review during the course of 2010 in consultation with the Garda Commissioner and my colleague the Minister for Finance.</p>

The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law. In preparing the Bill I will address a number of weaknesses in the current law to ensure that the bail regime can operate in as tight and effective a way as possible. I will also examine the extent to which the law could be restated to better guide the courts on the need to protect the public against those who present an unacceptable risk of committing a serious offence if granted bail.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_383">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1070">I am setting out below a tabular statement giving the latest available information in relation to drug seizures for 2007, 2008 and this year to date (up to and including 11 September 2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">As I have said before when replying to similar questions on this subject in the House, because of the covert nature of the activity, it is simply not possible to give a reliable estimate of the proportion of drugs coming into the country that these figures represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">Through ongoing specific initiatives and intelligence-led operations, An Garda Síochána continues to seize substantial quantities of illegal drugs and identify those involved in the importation, distribution, sale and supply of illegal drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">In addition to the officers of the Force specifically assigned to the drugs issue who are attached to the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Divisional Drug Units, officers from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau all assist in our overall law enforcement response to drug trafficking and drug dealing. In addition, the Gardaí work closely with Customs and the Naval Service under the umbrella of the Joint Task Force on Drugs as well as with their international colleagues in tackling the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">Recent and ongoing initiatives include</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">the operation of the Organised Crime Unit on a permanent capacity,</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">ongoing Irish involvement in the work of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre in Lisbon,</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">strengthened provisions in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 and</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">the ringfencing of resources  this year for Operation Anvil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">Furthermore, as the Deputy will know, I have in recent times introduced an extensive suite of criminal justice legislation targeted at those engaged in serious crime (including drug trafficking) including the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act and the  Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. I am confident that this package of legislation will be of particular value in tackling drugs gangs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">Finally, as I have also said on many occasions before, it is clear that we cannot tackle the problem of drug misuse through law enforcement measures alone.  As set out in the Government's recently launched new National Drugs Strategy for the period  2009 to 2016, we need to address the problem in a co-ordinated way across the pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">In this context, I can assure the House that my Department, and all the agencies under its aegis, remain fully committed to this approach and to the implementation of the Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">The Garda authorities advise that the following tables show the quantities of drugs seized in 2007, 2008 and up to and including 11 September 2009, on the basis of cases already reported to the Forensic Science Laboratory.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1157">The Deputy is referring to a recent judgment in which the Supreme Court found that a person charged before the District Court had a constitutional right to apply for legal aid for representation by counsel in cases where the court considers that there is a degree of gravity and complexity as well as any other exceptional circumstances which, taken together, necessitate that the legal aid granted should include counsel.  The provisions of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 limit the granting of legal aid to representation by a solicitor in District Court cases, except in cases of murder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">Having consulted with the Attorney General I introduced, with immediate effect following the judgment, an administrative scheme which ensures that the criminal courts can operate without restriction or delay.  The scheme is drafted to operate concurrently with the statutory scheme in the 1962 Act but differs from it to the extent that the court will not now be prevented from considering the provision of counsel in certain circumstances in the District Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">I intend to allow the administrative scheme to operate for a short period before bringing forward amending provisions to place the new provisions on a statutory footing.  This will be done in the Criminal Legal Aid Bill which is already being drafted to achieve other important changes in the operation of the Scheme.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_385">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1162">I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 117 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table contains the number of cases of murder in which a firearm was used, proceedings commenced and convictions secured from 1998 to 2008 and in 2009 up 5 November.  Of these murders, 21 took place in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">As the Deputies are aware, these statistics, by their nature, carry a significant health warning.  The detection rate for murders by its nature increases over time as Garda investigations progress.  It is expected that the number of convictions obtained will increase as Garda investigations are concluded and proceedings commenced are finalised by the courts.  This applies particularly to murders committed in the most recent years.  In addition, directions may be received from the Law Officers to charge persons arrested in connection with such incidents with offences other than murder, for example firearms offences.  Furthermore such persons charged and brought before the courts may be convicted of offences other than murder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by An Garda Síochána and will continue to be so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">While An Garda Síochána have made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings, there can be considerable difficulties for them in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities.  It has to be accepted that the reality is that associates of a victim of a gangland killing who would have information of value to An Garda Síochána often do not cooperate with Garda investigations.  Indeed, they frequently fail to cooperate even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  A number of changes to the law on evidence have been made to address this.  It has also to be accepted that there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it very difficult for An Garda Síochána in their investigation of such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward, and it is to assist such witnesses that the Witness Protection Programme is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">Our criminal law has been significantly strengthened in recent years.  Many of these changes are targeted at fighting gangland crime.  The Criminal Justice Acts of 2006 and 2007, in particular, introduced wide ranging reforms to strengthen the capacity of An Garda Síochána to tackle serious crime.  One of the most far reaching has been the introduction of seven day detention for offences connected with organised crime such as murder or kidnapping involving the use of a firearm.  The bail laws have been strengthened to allow the prosecution mount a more effective challenge to bail applications.  For example, applicants for bail can be required to provide a statement of their means so that the prosecution can highlight any divergence between their lifestyles and their stated means as evidence of their involvement in gangland activity.  The circumstances in which inferences may be drawn at trial from a suspect's silence in response to Garda questioning have also been expanded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">A significant further strengthening of the law dealing with those involved in criminal organisations took place with the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which became law on 23 July.  As a result, all organised crime offences will be tried in the Special Criminal Court unless the DPP directs otherwise.  This is being done to prevent intimidation of juries in those cases where such measures are necessary.  A new offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation has been created, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for the offence of participation or involvement in organised crime has been increased from 5 years to 15 years imprisonment.  Expert Garda opinion evidence on the existence and operations of criminal gangs is now admissible in evidence.  Furthermore, there are significant new provisions relating to bail, sentencing, drawing of inferences by the courts, intimidation of witnesses and jurors and a simplification of the procedures relating to the extension of time for questioning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">Other significant pieces of legislation introduced to target organised crime include the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act, which provides a statutory framework for evidence obtained by means of covert surveillance to be used in criminal trials, and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which further tightens the legislative provisions relating to guns and knives and similar weapons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">A further important development is the publication of the Criminal Procedure Bill 2009 which gives effect to the measures contained in the Justice for Victims Initiative.  The Bill provides for reform of the law on victim impact statements and proposes to end the ban on retrying people who have been acquitted in specified circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1171">I expect that the Criminal Justice (Forensic Sampling and Evidence) Bill, which will provide for the establishment and operation of a DNA database, will be published in this session.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">Operations against organised criminal gangs operating in this jurisdiction are undertaken on an ongoing basis.  The members of such gangs and their operating methods, criminal interests and financial assets are the subject of such operations, which are primarily undertaken by specialist units of An Garda Síochána, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">In particular, Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2005 to deal with serious crime, including murder and other violent crime, and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary focus of the Operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1181">I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 2009 (to 5 November) there have been 167 incidents involving suspected grenades, pipe-bombs or other improvised devices nationwide at which a Defence Forces Explosive Ordnance Device team has attended, with 180 such incidents recorded in 2008 and 98 incidents in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">I am further informed that in respect of the incidents that occurred in 2008 and 2009 (to 5 November) there have been a total of 89 arrests.  There have been four convictions and in another 56 cases the matters are currently before the courts or files are with the DPP.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is in the nature of proceedings for criminal offences that there may be a time period for the investigation, charge, prosecution and eventual conviction or acquittal, and the figures given may, therefore, be subject to change.  A detailed breakdown of the figures for 2007 is not readily available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">Investigations by the Garda Síochána into certain incidents involving the use of pipe bomb attacks in the greater Dublin area indicate links between members of a republican group and organised criminal elements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">Garda strategies in counteracting these activities are firmly focused on disrupting these organised criminal groups and where sufficient evidence is adduced, proffering charges and bringing such persons before the Courts.  The Gardaí will continue to take vigorous action in counteracting the threat posed by these gangs.  One of the priorities I have set for the Garda Síochána in 2009 is the targeting of serious crime, in particular organised, gun and drug related crime.  The Garda Policing Plan for 2009 contains a series of measures aimed at reducing the impact of crime and criminal behaviour.  These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in criminality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">Operation Anvil is an important nationwide operation to deal with serious crime, including murder and other violent crime.  The primary focus of this Operation is to target active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 further strengthens the law dealing with those involved in criminal organisations.

It is important to note, however, that the work of the Garda Síochána is driven by a community policing ethos. The new Garda Síochána National Model of Community Policing was launched earlier this year. This new model is about renewing, re-invigorating and re-structuring the Community Policing function within An Garda Síochána to deliver:</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">A consistent national structure to the Community Policing function,</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">A more coordinated and efficient Garda service to the community,</p>

            <p eId="para_1193">A National Community Policing Office has been established within Garda Community Relations Section to develop and oversee the implementation programme. The model is being rolled out nationwide in line with an action plan which has been developed for implementation. Training has already commenced in some Districts and it is intended that every District Officer throughout the country will take ownership of community policing within their area of responsibility. The Garda Síochána National Model of Community Policing Report is available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.</p>

         his views on crime statistics from the Central Statistics Office for the third quarter of 2009 and particularly the growth in burglaries and related offences; the steps that are being taken to combat the rise in this type of crime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_1214">The recorded crime statistics for the third quarter of 2009 released by the Central Statistics Office show a decrease in 10 of the 14 crime groups for which statistics are given.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">I particularly welcome the positive trends in the two groups containing the most serious offences of homicide and sexual offences, which showed decreases of 30% and 7.1%, respectively.  The number of murders was essentially static compared with the same quarter last year.  There were no incidents of manslaughter, and the number of cases of dangerous driving causing death decreased by 75%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1216">I also welcome the reduction of 3.9% overall in the number of weapons and explosives offences, with the number of cases of discharging a firearm decreasing by 1.8% and of possession of a firearm by a significant 30.9%.  The legislative provisions relating to guns and knives and similar weapons have been further tightened by the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  It is also heartening to see the reduction of 8.5% in public order offences, and I believe that the Garda strategy of identifying and targeting public order hotspots has been a significant factor in achieving this improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">The serious traffic offences of driving or being in charge of a vehicle while over the legal alcohol limit and being under the influence of drugs decreased by 18.8% and 36.3%, respectively.  These outcomes are due to a significant extent to the continuing high level of policing of our roads, as  a result of which there have been 42 fewer deaths on the roads to date this year compared with the same period last year.  Controlled drugs offences showed a decrease of 16.2%, with reductions in both the number of cases of possession of drugs for sale or supply (down 4.1%) and for personal use (down 19.6%).</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">Three of the four groups which showed an increase cover burglary, robbery and theft offences.  This trend is being monitored by the Garda Commissioner and his senior management, who have been constantly updating strategies and taking the actions necessary to counter it.  These include intelligence led operations to target those who are committing burglaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">An Garda Síochána continually develops and implements crime prevention and detection strategies to target in particular those who are committing burglaries with intelligence-led and focused operations.  For example, in order to prevent criminals moving around the country to commit such crimes, An Garda Síochána set up roving checkpoints.  There is also a strong focus on crime prevention and reduction.  At the beginning of this year, the Commissioner and I launched the new Garda National Model of Community Policing, not only to reduce crime but also the fear of crime and ensure a better quality of community life for all.  Furthermore, An Garda Síochána supports a number of initiatives which promote a community contribution to increasing public safety, including the Community Alert Programme, Neighbourhood Watch and Crimestoppers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">While the sentences provided by law for such crimes are already severe, at my request the Attorney General has asked the Law Reform Commission to look at the question of mandatory sentencing, particularly for those attacking the vulnerable in our society in this way.  Even where violence is not involved, I am very aware of the devastating effects these offences can have on people's lives.</p>

            <p eId="para_1222">Following receipt of the report dealing with the Dublin Archdiocese from the Commission of Investigation into Child Sexual Abuse and following consultation with the Attorney General's Office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution, I applied to the High Court for directions on publication of the report.  This was in accordance with section 38 of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, which provides for such an application if a Minister considers that the publication of a report might prejudice any criminal proceedings.  The High Court directed that the report be published but that references to a particular person not be published until the court otherwise directs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">As a result of a legal issue raised by the Director of Public Prosecutions after the court judgement, and in line with advice from the Attorney General's Office, I brought the matter back to the High Court for directions.  I am hopeful that the matter will be resolved shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">My primary goal is to see the perpetrators of appalling abuse face justice and due punishment and ensure that crimes against children are prevented in the future.  I have consistently made clear my wish to publish the report as quickly as possible, while at the same time ensuring, in line with the legislation governing the work of the Commission, that nothing would be done which might prejudice the possibility of a criminal prosecution.  It will be clear that I have acted at all times with due expedition, and in accordance with the legal advice which I have received, to achieve this.</p>

         his views on the fact that almost €32 million has been paid out over the past five years in respect of claims made against members of the Garda for wrongful arrest, assault and other reasons; the steps he is taking to address this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1226">Members of the Garda Síochána are called upon to interact with members of the public on a twenty four hour basis in a wide variety of situations — many of which are unavoidably contentious.   In the vast majority of cases these interactions are handled in an exemplary and professional manner and do not give rise to difficulty from a litigation point of view.  However, inevitably there is a small number of cases which give rise to the question of a legal liability on the part of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">The Commissioner, as Accounting Officer for An Garda Síochána, is concerned about the impact of the cost of these cases on the funds available to An Garda Síochána.  In all cases the advice of Counsel, the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General inform the approach taken in addressing the issues involved.   In most cases the advice leads to settlement of the cases but the question cannot be decided on a fiscal basis alone.  The Commissioner must ensure that a proper balance is maintained between the benefits that might accrue for the public purse in the event of prudent settlement agreements and the necessity to vigorously defend the right and duty of the gardaí to carry out their functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">Certain costs are outside the control of the Commissioner.  Once a case goes before the Courts the levels of compensation is determined by the Courts.  That said, one of the main elements of expenditure in this area is legal costs and my Department, in conjuction with the Attorney General, the Department of Finance and An Garda Síochána, is currently exploring possible ways to minimise such costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">I should point out that many of the civil actions that are taken do not involve any wrongdoing on the part of the Garda members concerned.  However, I can assure the Deputy that where there is wrongdoing the Commissioner enforces the discipline regulations appropriately.  Breaches of discipline are dealt with under new Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations which came into operation on 1 June 2007.  These Regulations have streamlined the disciplinary process and replaced the complex system which had developed over the years and was the subject of much criticism by the Morris Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">Finally, as regards the actual amounts paid over the past five years, the Deputy will see from the figures provided in my answer to Question 18 of 22 September 2009 that as the "Donegal-related" cases are finalised and removed from the equation the cost of legal actions is being reduced significantly.</p>

        <b>Deputy Willie Penrose</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the number of members of the Garda Reserve recruited to date in 2009; the stations to which they have been allocated; the number of applicants for the reserve currently in training; if he is satisfied with the rate of recruitment; when he expects that the full complement of 1,500 will be in place; if restrictions have been placed on recruitment to the reserve arising from budgetary restrictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1246">At 30 September 2009, there were 404 attested Reserve Gardaí and there are currently 201 Reserve trainees.  Details of the stations to which the Reserve members were assigned are set out in the table below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">The Agreed Programme for Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the full-time strength of the force.  As the Garda Reserve depends on volunteers who undertake their training and other duties during their free time, it is difficult to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the Garda Commissioner is continuing to make every effort to reach the recruitment target.  In that context, I would point out that the moratorium on recruitment and appointments in the public service does not apply to the Garda Reserve, as members are volunteers and do not draw a salary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">Recruitment is ongoing and the Public Appointments Service has received over 1,700 expressions of interest to join the Reserve in 2009.  The PAS hold interviews on a rolling basis at a range of locations around the country.  The ongoing public information campaign to recruit members to the Garda Reserve includes indoor and outdoor awareness raising campaigns and radio and TV promotional interviews nationally and locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">The Government is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve.</p>

            <p eId="para_1580">I wish to inform the Deputy that on 6 November 2009 there were 3,998 prisoners in custody.  I can confirm that on two occasions recently the prison population exceeded 4,000.  These were on 9 October 2009 when 4,009 prisoners were in custody and on 15 October 2009 when 4,003 prisoners were in custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and do not have the option of refusing committals.  It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 330.  This represents a 9% rise in the number in custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  A new accommodation block for 123 prisoners recently opened at Castlerea Prison. Furthermore, current projects will also provide the potential for an additional 750 prison spaces during 2009 and 2010 by means of:</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">a new block in Portlaoise Prison which will have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners and which has recently started to accommodate prisoners;</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">a new block in Wheatfield Prison which will also have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners which is due to open by end of 2009;</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">opening the separation unit in Mountjoy Prison which will have the potential to accommodate 50 prisoners due to open by end of this month;</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">a new wing at the Portlaoise/Midlands complex will have the potential to accommodate 300 prisoners.  Work is due to commence in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">In the longer term, the Government remains firmly committed to replacing the prisons on the Mountjoy complex with modern prison accommodation at Thornton Hall.  Building new prison facilities at Thornton Hall on a green field site will open up new opportunities for the development of structured regime activities that support rehabilitation and resettlement of prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">In developing its design concept for Thornton Hall the Irish Prison Service sought and continues to seek to deliver a modern, operationally efficient and cost effective facility which will provide decent living conditions for prisoners with appropriate support programmes including the provision of  modern facilities for prison staff.</p>

FÁS has recently put in place with my Department a fast-track redundancy notification system which facilitates early contact with companies and employees affected.  The agency, on receipt of notification from my Department of impending redundancies, makes contact with the company management concerned to discuss the services available from FÁS and the potential needs of the employees.

        <b>Deputy Deirdre Clune</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         the number of persons in Cork awaiting redundancy payments from her Department; the duration that they have been waiting; when it is envisaged that they will be paid; the number of persons awaiting payment nationally; the steps she will take to expedite the process; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_407">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1686">I can advise the Deputy that the latest figures available to end October 2009 indicate that the number of redundancy claims awaiting processing stands at 43,826.  Unfortunately, I am unable to provide the Deputy with the specific information she has requested as the Department does not collate statistics for applications awaiting processing on a county basis.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that at this time my focus and that of my Department is on ensuring that redundancy payments are processed as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing applications filed online from March 2009 and those submitted by post from February 2009 but expects shortly to be processing online claims submitted from April 2009 and manual claims from March 2009.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements as in this case, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first ten months of 2009 at 67,346.  This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 51.5 although the Section is currently carrying two vacant positions which are due to be filled;</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1701">The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) provide a source of support to small businesses with ten employees or fewer.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial (grant) support from the CEBs.  All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects, which should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">However, I would stress that priority is given to projects in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc), construction, as it is considered that these enterprises generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1703">As detailed above, not all projects fall within the CEB eligibility criteria for grant assistance, however, the company are advised to contact their local CEB to discuss matters in greater detail.  In addition to providing direct financial assistance, the CEBs also provide a range of indirect business advice and information assistances such as mentoring services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives, and the delivery of targeted Programmes to promote female entrepreneurship; these services may be available to the company. In order to more fully explore the range of options that may be available to them, they should initially contact their local County or City Enterprise Board (contact details of which are available at their national website www.enterpriseboards.ie), to discuss their business needs with the relevant staff of the board.</p>

            <p eId="para_1707">Redundancy claims from the company in question were received by my Department earlier this year and were paid out of the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in September 2009.  The employer claimed inability to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements of the employees on the basis that the company was insolvent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">In the case of employer default, where either the employer genuinely has insufficient assets or simply refuses to pay entitlements, the statutory redundancy lump sum entitlement is paid in full to the employee(s) from the Social Insurance Fund.  In such cases, the Department seeks to recover the moneys paid (which have preferential creditor status in a winding-up situation) from the employer, as these constitute debts due to the SIF.  This applies equally in circumstances such as liquidations, receiverships, examinerships or bankruptcy cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">In the current case, the Department has recently sought to recover from the employer 40% of the moneys owing to the SIF.  The basis for seeking the recovery of 40% of the statutory redundancy entitlements paid is that the employer would anyway have been entitled to a 60% rebate had he paid the redundancy entitlements directly to the employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">In general, Employment Law provides recourse for employees to pursue companies who have not respected certain entitlements due to them.  Under the Payment of Wages legislation for instance, an employee is entitled to take a case before the Rights Commissioner Service to establish a right and entitlement to a claim for unpaid wages and, if necessary, to have this enforced through the courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_1715">The apprenticeship system is a modular standards based system comprising seven alternating phases of on-the-job and off-the-job training and development.  Phases 1, 3, 5 and 7 are the on-the job phases and take place with a FÁS approved employer while the off-the-job phases 2, 4, and 6 are delivered in FÁS Training Centres; Institutes of Technology or Colleges of Further Education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">ESB Networks are providing up to 400 places, over two years, of on-the-job training, to redundant Electrical Apprentices.  These places are at phase 5 on-the-job, which is 26 weeks in duration.  ESB Networks will also provide on-the job training to apprentices at phase 7, which is 12 weeks in duration.  Phase 7 is the final phase of the apprenticeship programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">To qualify for the Advanced Certificate Craft an apprentice must successfully complete all phases (1-7) of the Standards Based apprenticeship programme and have completed a minimum of four years in employment as an apprentice in the specified trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">In the case where a redundant apprentice has completed phase 5 with ESB Networks successfully, and has also completed phase 6 successfully, their names will be submitted to ESB Networks by FÁS on a longest redundant basis for consideration for phase 7.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">An allocation of a phase 7 placement will depend on the outcome of the interview process undertaken by ESB Networks and the availability of places in ESB Networks at that time.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1721">Following is the information requested by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">Industry collaboration with the third-level sector</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">Enterprise Ireland operates three primary mechanisms aimed at helping companies to engage in R&amp;D both within the company and in collaboration with third level institutions: promoting market-led innovation and R&amp;D in manufacturing and services companies, supporting effective and flexible collaborations between companies and third-level researchers, and capitalising on the research investment made in the Higher Education sector by taking commercially useful technology on to the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">Enterprise Ireland operates a range of innovative supports to help companies engage with third level researchers to undertake collaborative research for the benefit of the company.  Companies can be supported to undertake individual research projects from initial small-scale collaborations, supported by means of €5,000 Innovation Vouchers or larger Innovation Partnerships.  Larger collaborative research projects involving groups of companies are also supported.  Industry Led Research Programmes and the new EI/IDA Competence Centre initiative allow industry groups to set a commercially valuable research agenda, which academics in the higher education sector will deliver on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">Innovation Partnership Initiative</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">It has proved extremely useful for firms to access innovative "know how" and R&amp;D solutions in the Third level system.  However participating in larger scale collaborative research projects can be both a risky and a costly process.  By providing key funding Enterprise Ireland helps to reduce both the cost and the risk associated with larger collaborative research projects.  As a result, the Innovation Partnership Initiative helps industry to engage in collaborative research projects with Irish universities and Institutes of Technology to develop new products and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">Impacts/Achievements:</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">In 2008 52 collaborative projects were supported with €8.3 million grant aid and €5 million cash and in-kind aid being inputted by the industrial partners.  The majority of these research ventures were large projects which reflects EI's strategy to increase the scale of supported projects.  Companies from 17 diverse sectors have participated in the scheme.  133 industrially relevant research staff were hired and supported through the programme in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">The aim is to support 34 EI Clients in the programme in 2009.  21 companies collaborative projects are currently being supported or in the pipeline.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">Industry-led research Programmes</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">The <i>Industry-led Research Programme</i> brings companies with a common research problem together to collaborate with each other and the available talent pool.  Designed to suit SMEs and start-up companies, each Industry-led Network typically runs for 2-3 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">Impacts/Achievements:</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">To date 93 companies are engaged in six Industry-led Research Programmes in areas like power electronics, e-Learning and mobile telecommunications.  The e-Learning ILRP is recognised as a world leader in learning technology.  In 2009 60 new collaborative research projects will be supported through this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">Competence Centres</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">Competence Centres, a joint EI/IDA initiative are collaborative centres of excellence established and led by industry, resourced by highly-qualified researchers within research institutions who are empowered to undertake market focused strategic R&amp;D for the benefit of industry.  They have a more formal industry led organisational structure which brings academics and companies together in a more ordered environment and also have a longer term research focus than Industry Led Research Programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">Impacts/Achievements:</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">To date 65 companies have become involved in establishing seven competence centres nationally.  Two centres have launched to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">The Food for Health Competence Centre (FHI) was launched in 2008.  FHI is pursuing a collaborative market led research programme between four of Ireland's largest dairy companies; Dairygold Food Ingredients, Glanbia Nutritionals, Carbery and Kerry Ingredients Ireland and a partnership between University College Cork, University College Dublin, University of Limerick and Teagasc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">I had the pleasure of launching, on November 2nd, the Competence Centre for Applied Nanotechnology involving some of the world's leading companies such as multinationals Intel, Seagate, Medtronic and Analog Devices and Irish companies Aerogen, Audit Diagnostics, Creganna and Proxy Biomedical.  Nanotechnology is one of these fields where there is enormous potential for Ireland, in niche areas of drug delivery and diagnostic equipment, medical devices and ICT, which is why the Government has committed to invest, through Enterprise Ireland, €5 million over the next five years in the Competence Centre for Applied Nanotechnology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">Applied Research Enhancement Programme</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">The Enterprise Ireland Applied Research Enhancement Centres scheme provides a local centre of excellence in applied research in the Institutes of Technology which collaborate with local companies.  The objectives of the ARE Programme are to generate regional economic activity through the creation of a strong applied research base.  The ARE funding has increased the size and skills base of the research teams in the IoTs and increased their capability and capacity to engage in applied research with regional and national based businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">Impacts/Achievements:</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">To date 17 ARE centres are established throughout the country with funding of €1.2 million to €2 million per centre for a 3 to 5 year period.  This is a commitment from EI of €23.4 million (excluding overheads).  35 industrially relevant research projects have been completed in 2008.  Forty one industrial projects have been completed since the start of this year and there are sixty five ongoing collaborative projects with industry partners.  These include Innovation Vouchers, Innovation Partnerships and fully funded industrial projects.  Two spinout companies have emerged from the 3CS centre at WIT.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">The following table shows commitments and payments up to the end of August for new projects.  Contracts for approvals made in September and October have yet to issue.</p>

The asset figures have in general improved in the interim but are subject to market fluctuations.  As it is not proposed to transfer any assets from these funds to the National Pensions Reserve Fund before 31 December 2009, there will be no exposure for the taxpayer for 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2079">I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners there is no register or list of so called "tax exiles"; there is nothing in Irish tax law that makes reference to "tax exile status".</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">The taxation of individuals in the State is in line with that prevailing in most other OECD jurisdictions, that is to say — (a) Individuals who are resident in the State for tax purposes (based on the number of days of presence in the State) are taxable here on their worldwide income; and (b) Individuals who are not resident here for tax purposes pay tax here only on income arising in the State and on income derived from working here.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">I am informed by Revenue that 5,867 non-resident individuals filed Irish tax returns for the 2007 tax year (the latest year for which figures are available) in respect of their Irish-source income or income derived from working here.  Many of these non-residents are foreign nationals or have a foreign domicile; and many of the non-resident Irish citizens or Irish domiciled individuals included in this figure may have become non-resident for reasons unrelated to taxation, but have retained Irish investments such as rental property.  These individuals could not be categorised as "tax exiles" under any reasonable definition of that term.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">I have already, in section 15 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008, amended the tax residence rules to provide that an individual will be regarded as present in the State for a day if he or she is in the State at any time during the day, not just at midnight.  This applies for the 2009 tax year and subsequent tax years.  The Commission on Taxation has recommended further changes in this area.  The renewed Programme for Government also contains a commitment to further changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">As to the NAMA issues, as stated, there is no list or register of so called "tax exiles".  Individuals do not "avail of" NAMA. It is not, as the Deputy is aware, a bail out or support for borrowers, it is a transfer of loans from banks to NAMA, which will pursue payment of these loans. The National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009 is designed to address a serious threat to the economy and to the stability of credit institutions in the State through the transfer of the riskier loans on the balance sheets of participating institutions to the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). Until the full transfer of eligible loans has been completed, it will not be possible to analyse individual loan files and collate detailed information on borrowers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2088">I have no function in regard to the level of ECB lending as this is a matter for the ECB and the associated national central banks, and it would be inappropriate for Ministers to comment on specific institutions in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2089">AIB and Bank of Ireland gave certain commitments to make funds available as part of recapitalisation and figures on their SME lending form part of the supplementary documentation on NAMA which I circulated in the Dáil on 16 September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">A Report Stage amendment to the NAMA Bill provides a power to issue guidelines to the participating institutions on lending practices and procedures to improve the flow of credit to SMEs and, if necessary, other sectors and guidelines relating to the review of decisions of participating institutions to refuse credit facilities. The power is a wide ranging one and will allow for a response adapted to the particular circumstances of different institutions and sectors. This approach recognises that this is a complex situation and allows for a flexible response to changing credit needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">It should be noted that the Central Bank figures for lending are calculated after various adjustments, notably the deduction of banks' provisions against possible losses. Accordingly, where the headline figure shows a reduction, this may not mean that actual lending has fallen, as the ECB monthly bulletins have explained.</p>

            <p eId="para_2098">The responsibility for making valuations and issuing valuation certificates for rating purposes under the Valuation Act 2001 rests with the Commissioner of Valuation. There is provision for the ratepayer to make representations before the valuation becomes effective. If the ratepayer is dissatisfied with the outcome of his representations there is a right of appeal, also embodied in the Act, in the first instance to the Commissioner and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal. There is a further right of appeal to the Superior Courts on a point of law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">I am informed that the current rateable valuation on the National Aquatic Centre was determined on appeal to the Commissioner in 2004. The valuation of the Aquatic Centre was also the subject of a Valuation Tribunal appeal in 2008 and neither its valuation nor rateable status was altered.</p>

            <p eId="para_2101">The Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Valuation Act 2001 and the making of valuations for rating purposes is his sole prerogative.

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_428">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2131">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total identifiable costs to the Exchequer of all income tax and corporation tax allowances, reliefs, exemptions and tax credits available, are set out in the following tables for 2006, the most recent year for which the necessary detailed historical information is available. Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.  The Deputy will be aware I have provided similar information to Deputy Mary Upton as recently as 3 November, 2009 in reply to PQ 38216/09.</p>
            <p eId="para_2132">Estimates of the prospective yield to the Exchequer in 2010 from the abolition or standard rating of each deduction and relief from incomes over the specified ranges, are not available. These estimates could not be provided without undertaking an extensive and costly development of the Revenue tax model nor would they capture any behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such change or their economic effects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2133">Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2006 and 2005</p>
            <p eId="para_2134">The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system.  A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_2135">An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2136">The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity.  The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the "costs" of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a "loss of tax revenue" on profits. To compute such "loss", regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2138">The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.</p>
            <p eId="para_2139">The figures of cost are for 2006 and 2005 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2140">The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged.  It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures. For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs.  Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits.  For instance, a person with €1,000 gross trading profits, €1,000 capital allowances and €1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on €1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn.  In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on €1,000.  Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information. Some of the cost figures included in the table for 2005 reflect revisions to figures previously published in the 2007 Report.</p>

It also includes the cost of exempting certain bodies from the deduction on income arising from government securities. Information is not available about other income received gross.</p>

Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that €3340 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2006 accounting periods but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_2513"><sup>(15)</sup> The cost does not include any notional cost associated with IFSC companies. The International Financial Services activity in Ireland represents new business which has developed as a result of, among other things, the concessionary tax rate. This means that as the cost of the concessionary rate is not just the difference between the concessionary tax rate and the full tax rate, it is therefore not quantifiable. In regard to the cost shown for the effective rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing and certain other activities, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises may not have set up here. To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of the cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.</p>

            <p eId="para_2661">There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns. Revenue drew the attention of the relevant tax practitioner bodies to these deficiencies to rectify them in future returns and also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2662">The estimated costs have assumed tax foregone at the 41% rate in the case of income tax and 12.5% in the case of corporation tax. This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually subject to tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_2688">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that under section 132 of Finance Act 1992, vehicle registration tax (VRT) is chargeable, leviable and payable on the registration of vehicles in the State.  There is no provision in law for the exemption from, or reduction in, the charge to VRT in relation to vehicles that were previously registered in another jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_2689">I would add that VRT is a national tax and does not contravene EU law.  Article 90 of the EC Treaty allows Member States to charge national taxes provided that there is no discrimination against imported goods in favour of indigenous goods. It provides that "No Member State shall impose, directly or indirectly, on the products of other Member States any internal taxation of any kind in excess of that imposed directly or indirectly on similar domestic products".</p>

          the amount of money which could be saved by directing all Government Departments, agencies and State bodies to utilise skype, or other similar voice internet protocol technology, to the exclusion of traditional fixed telephony; if this has been examined; the usage to date of such technology; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [40516/09]

            <p eId="para_2692">My Department has examined Skype and equivalent services, and agrees that it offers potential to reduce telephony costs.  However, Skype is just one provider of public IP-based telephony services and there are numerous other ways in which IP-based telephony can be provided.  Under procurement law, and to ensure maximum competition, my Department and all public bodies must give equal opportunity to other providers.  Additionally, the use of public IP-based telephony services introduces considerable security risks for corporate networks.  Consequently, to ensure the protection of their networks and the data of customers of public bodies, it is imperative that public bodies remain in direct control of their IP-based telephony services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2693">Accordingly, my Department has worked with public bodies over the past number of years to implement secure IP-based telephony services — these use the same underlying IP-based technology and bypass techniques of public IP-based telephony systems such as Skype.  This approach has resulted in considerable cost reductions for telephony services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2694">In addition, my Department has put in place a range of telephony procurement frameworks and central procurement standards for mobile voice and data, fixed voice and Voice over IP (VoIP), and fixed data communications.  These frameworks and central standards have ensured that all telephony providers have equal access to procurement opportunities in the public service.  The Government decided some time ago that these frameworks and standards must be used by all civil and public service bodies.  As a result, there is now intense competition for public service telephony business resulting in considerable cost reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2695">The combination of these procurement frameworks and central standards, and the IP-based technology approaches being used, have resulted in very considerable cost reductions for telephony use in the public service, ranging from 20% to 70%, dependent on the nature of the organisation and the type of calls it makes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2724">The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 defines "long-term residential care services" as maintenance, health and personal care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2725">Under the Act, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has responsibility for the negotiation of prices for the provision of long-term residential care services with private nursing home providers. This price negotiation is based on the definition of "long-term residential care services" as set out in the Act and on the supplementary policy information provided by the Department as follows: bed and board, nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person, laundry service, and basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living.</p>
            <p eId="para_2726">The cost for each public nursing home has been determined using the definition of "long-term residential care services" underpinned by an agreed set of cost components which has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

            <p eId="para_2770">The Adoption Bill 2009, which is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, has passed through the Seanad and is scheduled to be debated in Dáil Éireann in the current Dáil session.  The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2771">The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a contracting State to the Hague Convention or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement. For non-Hague countries only those adoptions effected prior to the commencement of the new law can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_2772">There are transitional provisions contained in the Bill. However, the issue of further transitional measures for prospective parents who are at an advanced stage when the Bill is enacted, and who wish to continue with an adoption from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, have been raised with me by representative groups. I am currently examining this and other related matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_2773">My Office has been in negotiations with the Vietnamese Government regarding the drafting of a new bilateral inter-country Adoption agreement for some time. I have clearly indicated my intention to await the finalisation of the International Social Services Report on Intercountry Adoption in Vietnam before making final decisions regarding the next steps. I will be considering the report along with the report published in August by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. I anticipate the ISS report will be finalised this month. I will be communicating my decision at the earliest opportunity. I am extremely mindful of the difficult position many prospective adopters find themselves in at this point in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">The Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Hoang Trung Hai recently led a trade mission to Ireland.  I took the opportunity to meet again with Minister Hai whom I had met with during my July visit to Vietnam. The meeting took place on 23 October. Adoption matters were discussed. The meeting was most amicable and allowed both Governments to outline their current positions in relation to the bilateral agreement and legislative developments in each jurisdiction, including Hague Convention ratification. Both Governments restated their desire to achieve the highest standards in intercountry adoption and they committed to ongoing dialogue to advance these goals.</p>

            <p eId="para_2784">The Employment Control Framework, which was agreed in March of this year sets out the overall policy for staffing levels in the health sector for 2009. The Framework incorporates the general moratorium on recruitment in the public sector. However, the moratorium has been modulated to minimise the impact on front line services and, in particular, on areas such as disability, services for older people, and child care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2785">One of the key features of the Employment Control Framework for 2009 is that the approved employment ceiling for the health sector for 2009 is 111,800 WTEs. In addition, within this employment ceiling there will be a 3% payroll reduction for management and administrative grades in 2009 leading to a reduction of at least 500 in the numbers employed in these grades.</p>
            <p eId="para_2786">The employment control framework specifically exempts staff in the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians.</p>
            <p eId="para_2787">The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector. The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer, mental health and disability services. Following a submission from the Health Service Executive earlier this year, it was agreed that special provisions would also apply in relation to Clinical Engineering Technicians, Dosimetrists, Physicists, and Radiation Therapists, which are specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme). The framework also provides that a proposal for the filling of a post on exceptional grounds will only be considered through the redeployment of a member of staff of the same or equivalent grade from another post or, the suppression of another or a number of other posts of an equivalent salary value to the post being proposed for filling.</p>
            <p eId="para_2788">Furthermore, staff will be redeployed within and across pillars and from one institution to another to support the development of integrated care delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2789">Health employment levels are monitored by the Joint Employment Control Monitoring Committee, which comprises officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the HSE. This committee also reviews the implementation of the moratorium and any issues arising.</p>

            <p eId="para_2795">The document <i>An Integrated Workforce Planning Strategy for the Health Services — 2009–2012</i> was published on 6 November. The strategy was designed and developed to ensure integration of workforce planning activity with the broader objectives of financial and service planning in the Irish health care and social care system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2796">As a significant proportion of health funding is spent on staff costs, it is necessary to ensure that it is spent efficiently and delivers on key health goals. The strategy sets out the four key principles to guide integrated workforce planning, i.e., patient/client focus, sustainability, availability and flexibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_2797">It supports the development of health service human resources including initiatives already under way such as improved Consultant/NCHD ratios, Nurse Prescribing and SKILL development for support staff. It also provides health service planners with the tools to assess other sources of supply through redeployment, retraining or changed skill mix.</p>
            <p eId="para_2798">This strategy sets out to enhance existing workforce planning analysis in the Irish health service for a wide range of health care occupations. For example, the Strategy follows the publication in June of the report by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) and FÁS —<i>A Quantitative Tool for Workforce Planning in Healthcare.</i> That report contained workforce planning analysis for selected health care occupations and provided a valuable evidence base for workforce planning decisions resulting from policy and demographic changes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2800">The report <i>A Quantitative Tool for Workforce Planning in Healthcare,</i> which was undertaken by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit in FÁS, was commissioned in December 2007 and the research began in February 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2801">The purpose of the FÁS workforce planning study of 12 health care grades was to inform the workforce planning analysis of the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive. The work of FÁS was overseen by a liaison group which assisted FÁS and reported to the Joint DOHC/HSE Working Group. The terms of reference were as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2802">FÁS will undertake an analysis of supply and demand for the specified health care grades.</p>
            <p eId="para_2803">This will include an analysis of relevant factors affecting supply and demand for the individual grades. These factors could include the demand and availability of the grades internationally, but particularly in the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_2804">It is anticipated that both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected for the purpose of the study.</p>
            <p eId="para_2805">If insufficient data is available through the secondary sources available to FÁS, primary data collection in terms of surveys will take place. The Department and the HSE will provide the necessary support to FÁS to compile secondary data.</p>
            <p eId="para_2806">FÁS will be required to make recommendations on the workforce planning implications for the ten professions. This will involve looking at UK and wider international availability of these professions and current immigration inflows of professionals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2807">A timeframe of 6-9 months is estimated for the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_2808">HSE representatives will shadow FÁS staff during this study to allow for the transfer of skills from FÁS to the HSE thus increasing workforce planning capacity in the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_2822">The objectives of the study were (i) to develop a quantitative model which can be used beyond the project as a tool for assessment of different policy scenarios relevant in the context of the Governments' health care workforce planning; and (ii) to simulate the model and assess, in quantitative terms, the balance between the current and expected future demand and supply of skills under different sets of assumptions about the model parameters as defined by the liaison group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2823">The report was published on 17 June 2009 and provides a valuable evidence base for workforce planning decisions in respect of the twelve health care occupations covered by the study. It has attempted to take an economy wide approach including the private sector to assess the total demand for the occupations. The report outlines a number of workforce projections for some grades. For some occupations, there are forecasted shortages while others show an excess supply. The report can be used as a tool for future workforce planning projections. It is available on the website of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2825">The Health Service Executive has advised that to date almost 90% of medical consultants have accepted Consultant Contract 2008, with 1,688 consultants out of 1,888 permanent consultants working in the public health service having opted for the new contract arrangements.  The Executive has advised that approximately 200 consultants have remained on the 1997 consultants contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_2826">It had been agreed that consultants who signed the new contract would receive a 5% increase in salary with effect from 14 September 2007 and a further increase, the level of which would depend upon the individual's existing and new contract type: half of this remaining increase was to be paid from 1 June 2008 and the balance from 1 June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2827">Although I sought and received Oireachtas approval for a Supplementary Estimate of €68m to cover the 2008 costs of the new contract, it was ultimately decided not to proceed with the new salary rates in the absence of sufficient demonstrable progress in relation to implementation on the ground and, as a result, no payments were made in 2008 in respect of the new contract.  Accordingly the €68m provided in the Supplementary Estimate was subsequently surrendered to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2828">The HSE's 2009 Estimate provided for an additional €140m to cover the full year cost of implementing the Consultant Contract 2008.  On 24 April 2009, following a verification exercise undertaken by the HSE, I sanctioned part payment of the new salary scales for consultants who signed up to the new contract.  The previously agreed rates would apply from 1 January 2009.  However, I was not in a position to sanction the final phase, the increase due from 1 June 2009 nor increased on-call and call-out payments.  It is estimated that this will save approximately €75m in 2009 in addition to the €68m not paid in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2829">Salary increases under the new contract, excluding the final phase payment that would have been due from 1 June 2009, range from €35,249 to €52,909 for a Type A contract, €24,743 to €42,402 for a Type B Contract and €18,737 to €26,643 for a Type B* Contract.   A copy of the current payscales for consultants is available on my Department's website at www.dohc.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_2830">It is my intention that the deferred increase would be reviewed in September 2010 on the same basis as the deferred increase awarded to Ministerial and Parliamentary office-holders and for other senior public servants under the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector (Report 42).  However, this is without prejudice to any decisions that the Government might make in the interim in relation to the remuneration of senior public service grades generally arising from the review recently undertaken by the Review Body.</p>

            <p eId="para_2833">Within the Health Group of Votes, the 2008 Budget provided for an additional €1.16 billion expenditure in 2008 bringing the total to €16.156 billion.</p>

            <p eId="para_2836">(i) savings of €85m in 2008 arising from the delay in implementing the new nursing home support scheme, the <i>Fair Deal</i>;</p>

            <p eId="para_2841">Clearly, the current fiscal position demands the most careful control of public expenditure and I am strongly of the view that account needs to be taken of all opportunities for efficiencies.  I am conscious of the need to make savings where possible without impacting on service levels and I have consistently communicated this need to the HSE and other health agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2842">As part of a multi-annual approach to value for money announced by me in the context of the Budget, a range of value for money measures was outlined in the HSE Service Plan 2009 and is reported on a monthly basis in the HSE Performance Reports against the Plan.  The value for money savings of €280m achieved in 2008 are currently reported as being broadly maintained in 2009.  The HSE also currently anticipates meeting the required €115m overall value for money savings target for 2009 identified in the Plan. While savings in some areas have been lower than expected, the HSE envisages that these will be compensated for through additional savings being achieved in other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2843">The Service Plan also targeted the achievement of €135m in service reconfiguration efficiency measures in 2009 in order to offset expected cost pressures and stay within budget.  The HSE has experienced unforeseen cost pressures in areas such as the pandemic flu and higher than expected superannuation costs associated with increase in retirements.  Notwithstanding these pressures, the HSE continues to control spending to the greatest degree possible within the limits approved for its Vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_2844">Operational responsibility for the management of value for money is a matter for the Health Service Executive.

            <p eId="para_2847">Where a person's assets include land and property, the 5% contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected at a later date. This is an optional element of the scheme called the Nursing Home Loan. This loan will become repayable after the person's death or if the person sells/transfers their property (if this occurs before their death).</p>
            <p eId="para_2848">A person's principal residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care. This is known as the 15% or "three year" cap.  It means that a person will pay the 5% contribution based on their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care.  After three years, even if a person is still getting long-term nursing home care, they will not pay any further contribution based on the principal residence. This "three year" cap applies regardless of whether a person chooses to opt for the loan or not.</p>
            <p eId="para_2849">In the case of a couple, where one partner remains in the home while the other enters a nursing home, the contribution based on assets is 2.5% per annum and the contribution based on the principal residence is capped at 7.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2850">If there is a spouse or certain dependents living in the principal residence when the person in nursing home care dies, the repayment of the loan may be further deferred.</p>
            <p eId="para_2851">The people who can avail of a further deferral are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2852">(i) the spouse or partner of the original applicant, or</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2853">(ii) certain people, termed "connected persons", who satisfy the following conditions:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2854">The asset in question must be their only residence.</p>

The central principle of the scheme is that each person makes a contribution towards their nursing home costs based on their ability to pay and then has the balance of their care costs met by the State regardless of whether they are in a public, private or voluntary nursing home.  Applicants to the scheme will be furnished with a list of public, voluntary and approved private nursing homes and can choose care in any nursing home on the list.  However, in order for financial support to be provided, the nursing home must have a place for them and it must be able to cater for their particular care needs.

However, I should bring to the Deputy's attention that on 1 May 2009 there were 1,691 retail pharmacy businesses registered and that up to 5 November 2009 there have been 30 new retail pharmacy businesses registered.

            <p eId="para_2993">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which is being introduced in January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2994">The standard capitation fee which will be payable to services participating in the new scheme, will be approximately €2,450 per annum in respect of each qualifying child availing of the free pre-school year in the service.  This is equivalent to approximately €276 per month, where a service is participating for 38 weeks or €207 per month, where it participates for 50 weeks.  This payment will be made, in advance, at the beginning of each term.  A higher capitation fee of €2,850 per annum will be payable to sessional playschool services with highly qualified staff.  This is equivalent to approximately €321 per month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2995">Services can choose to deliver the pre-school year from a range of options.  For example a full or part-time daycare service normally providing the free pre-school place for 2 hours 15 minutes a day, five days a week over 50 weeks will be paid a capitation fee of €48.50 per week, and a playschool sessional service normally providing the pre-school service for three hours a day, five days a week over 38 weeks will be paid a capitation fee of €64.50 per week, or €75 per week where the higher capitation fee applies.  Full or part-time daycare services may also provide the free pre-school place for three hours 45 minutes a day, three days a week over 50 weeks, to facilitate parents in part-time employment in which case the capitation fee payable will not be affected</p>
            <p eId="para_2996">The objective of the ECCE scheme is to ensure that all children have the opportunity to avail of free pre-school provision.  It is hoped that parents will avail of the full provision and maximise the benefits to their children from exposure to early learning in appropriate settings.  To facilitate existing patterns of pre-school provision during the introductory stage of the scheme in January next, services which currently provide pre-school places on a pro-rata basis (i.e. places are offered on a shared basis) may continue to do so during January/June 2010.  Pro-rata arrangements may not, however, be continued beyond September 2010.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_3001">I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 to 226, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3002">I have responsibility for the implementation of the new free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which will be introduced in January 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3003">Under the ECCE scheme, participating services will be paid a standard annual capitation fee of €2,450 in return for the provision of the free pre-school year.  The payment will be made, in advance, at the beginning of each term.  Services participating in the scheme should be satisfied that they will be in a position to meet all of their costs from the capitation provided and additional funding will not be provided where this is not the case.  Participating services may charge parents for additional services, provided these are clearly optional and children not availing of such services continue to receive appropriate programme based provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3004">A higher capitation rate of €75 per week (€2,850 p.a.) will be available to sessional playschool services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the scheme.  To qualify for the higher capitation rate all Pre-School leaders in the service must hold a major award in early childhood care and education or equivalent (title of courses may vary) at a minimum Level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications and have three years experience working in the sector, and all assistants must hold a relevant Fetac level 5 qualification or its equivalent.</p>
            <p eId="para_3005">It is considered that the capitation rates are reasonable and will accommodate the greater majority of services.  This is borne out by the fact that 90% of pre-school services operating in the State have applied for entry to the scheme.  The financial circumstances of individual pre-school service providers are matters for the persons concerned and cannot be provided for when establishing a national scheme in which more some 4,200 services will participate.  The scheme represents an investment of almost €170 million annually in pre-school services and in light of the current economic situation there are no proposals to increase this provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3006">The scheme will normally be required to provide services on a five day per week basis.  However, during the initial period January-August 2010, services which are already accommodating children on a pro rata-basis, may continue to do so and the capitation grant will be set by reference to the number of children attending per day rather than the total number of children per week.  This is a transitional arrangement to allow services to adjust to the requirements of the new scheme.  However, from September 2010, services participating in the scheme will be required to provide full rather than pro-rata preschool year places.  Parents will be encouraged to avail of the free pre-school year on the basis of full attendance and participating services will be required to give priority to parents using the service on this basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3007">Quite a number of workers in the ECCE sector lack formal qualifications but have many years of experience.  The challenge now is to recognise the non-formal learning of workers in this position and to ensure that there are flexible ways for people to obtain qualifications and to build on these qualifications.  Ireland has been participating in an OECD study on the recognition of non-formal and informal learning.  A national report was drafted in 2006/2007 by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland with the assistance of an Advisory Group and, in particular, with HETAC and FETAC.  The aim of the report was to document and review the current situation in Ireland regarding the recognition of prior non-formal and informal learning.  The OECD's review team report was published in December 2008 and a national action plan for the Recognition of Prior Learning is now being developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3008">Applications by approximately 4,200 childcare pre-school services to enter the new scheme indicate a capacity of 98,000 pre-school year places.  It is hoped that some 63,000 children will avail of the scheme in January 2010.  Contracts are currently issuing to all services which meet the criteria of the scheme and a list of services approved to participate in the scheme will be available shortly from the City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs).  Based on the applications to date, I am confident that the total number of places available in pre-school services applying to enter the scheme will meet the number of places required.</p>

            <p eId="para_3034">The Government decision on the moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade is being implemented in the health sector in such a way as to ensure that key services are maintained in so far as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3035">The employment control framework specifically exempts staff in the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians. The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector. The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer, mental health and disability services. Following a submission from the Health Service Executive earlier this year, it was agreed that special provisions would also apply in relation to Clinical Engineering Technicians, Dosimetrists, Physicists, and Radiation Therapists, which are specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3036">The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided. The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.</p>
            <p eId="para_3037">The HSE will be focusing on the scope that exists within the health services for reorganising and restructuring of work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery. The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care. It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.</p>
            <p eId="para_3038">The operation of the framework, including the moratorium on recruitment, is kept under review by my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Health Service Executive.</p>

            <p eId="para_3069">The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act. Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3070">Items available for sale in so-called "head shops" are currently not scheduled under Misuse of Drugs legislation. The list of scheduled substances is kept under ongoing review. For example, in 2006 psychotropic ("magic") mushrooms, which were on sale in such outlets, were banned and their possession and sale is now illegal. On 31 March 2009, BZP was similarly subjected to legislative control measures and criminal sanctions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3071">Minister John Curran, Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, who has responsibility for co-ordinating the National Drugs Strategy, has identified head shops as an area of concern, and is currently considering the options available to more effectively control the activities of head shops. My officials are in contact with their counterparts in the Office of the Minister for Drugs in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_3076">The Government decision on the moratorium on recruitment, promotion, or payment of an allowance for the performance of duties at a higher grade is being implemented in the health sector in such a way as to ensure that key services are maintained in so far as possible in the health services, particularly in respect of children at risk, older people and persons with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3077">The employment control framework specifically exempts staff in the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians. The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector. The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer, mental health and disability services. Following a submission from the Health Service Executive earlier this year, it was agreed that special provisions would also apply in relation to Clinical Engineering Technicians, Dosimetrists, Physicists, and Radiation Therapists, which are specialist grades under the National Cancer Control Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3085">The ECCE scheme is a general one and services participating will be required to make reasonable accommodation for children with special needs in accordance with the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2004.  However, the scheme takes account of a number of issues to accommodate children with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3086">While the age range in which children will qualify for the scheme is, generally, between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on 1 September each year, exceptions are allowed where a child has been assessed by the HSE as having a special need which will delay his or her entry to primary school.  In such cases, the pre-school year relevant to such children will be taken as their qualifying year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3087">Additionally, the general requirement that a child would be expected to attend 4 or 5 days each week will not apply to children with special needs where a shorter week would be more appropriate to their needs.  Many specialist pre-school services arrange for children attending their services to also attend a mainstream service for 1, 2 or 3 days a week.  As a result, 1 full week place in the mainstream service could cater for 2 or more children with special needs on a pro-rata basis.  Where appropriate, children with special needs attending a mainstream pre-school service on a pro-rata basis, may be permitted to avail of a second free pre-school year e.g. attending 2 days per week in the first year and 3 days per week in the second.  Should additional flexibility in the arrangements for the scheme be required by specialist pre-school services for children with special needs, these will also be considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_3117">The administration of the Local Improvements Scheme (LIS) is a matter for the relevant county council, subject to the terms of the Local Improvements Scheme Memorandum and relevant Departmental circulars. Applications under the scheme are submitted to, and decided by, the relevant county council. My Department has no function in the selection of specific projects for grant aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_3118">My Department's role is confined to the allocation of funds under the scheme to individual county councils. This is decided annually in the context of the overall funds available and the number of LIS applications on hands in each county at the end of the previous year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3119">I have set out the details regarding Local Improvement Scheme grants provided by my Department to local authorities for 2007 and 2008 in the table below together with the grant allocations made by my Department in 2009.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_3255">The Deputy will be aware that the Government approved proposals in March, 2008 to develop national children detention facilities to be located on the existing State-owned Oberstown campus near Lusk, Co. Dublin.  The Government also approved the establishment of a cross-Departmental Working Group to consider the possible future role for Finglas Child and Adolescent Centre (FCAC), the only children detention school not currently located on the Oberstown campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_3256">The Working Group presented its report earlier this year (available at www.iyjs.ie) and I have accepted its recommendations.  This will involve the closure of the Centre, which will be completed by the end of March 2010, and the transfer in the meantime of all children, staff and services from FCAC to the Oberstown campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_3257">The Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS), an executive office of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and part of my Office, is responsible for managing the four Children Detention Schools.  Working with the Directors and senior management of all four Schools, the IYJS is now planning for the development of an integrated unified detention school service based in Oberstown.  This is in line with the Government decision to build new children detention facilities there which will provide the full range of remand, assessment and detention services for all young offenders remanded or detained by the courts.  It will provide all of the services currently provided by the FCAC.</p>
            <p eId="para_3258">To this end, the IYJS is currently working on implementing a strategy for the future integration of the Schools.  I am pleased to say that the Directors of the four Schools have each taken on additional cross-campus responsibilities in preparation for integration.  Working closely with the IYJS, the Directors are now leading on and developing proposals for the future management, staffing and operational needs of the Schools.  In the meantime, discussions, facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission, are due to commence in the next fortnight with some of the Unions representing the staff in Finglas on the closure of the Centre, the transition to Oberstown and the arrangements that need to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_3259">As regards the assessment service, rather than keep it as a separate service, the working group was of the view that the experience and skills of FCAC staff will form a necessary part of an integrated detention school in Oberstown.  The group also recommended that further work should be carried out to identify and develop the appropriate range of assessment services for detained children in the new facility at Oberstown and for all other young people, offending or non-offending, in the community.  Building on the expertise already available and working with the key people involved, I understand that the IYJS will be undertaking this work as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3260">The IYJS is also responsible for providing safe and secure accommodation for children detained by the courts.  As things stand, there are more than enough bed places in Oberstown to accommodate the children currently detained in FCAC, and that has been the case for some time now.  I am satisfied that the IYJS will be in a position to provide sufficient places within the existing detention school facilities in Oberstown to meet the needs of the courts for the detention of young offenders and, where appropriate, assessment.</p>

            <p eId="para_3263">Peace Commissioners are appointed under section 88 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.  The Office of Peace Commissioner is an honorary appointment and Peace Commissioners receive no remuneration or compensation by way of fees or expenses for their services.  An application for appointment may be submitted by a person who is interested in obtaining an appointment or a third party may submit a nomination in respect of a person considered suitable for appointment.  Nominations are generally received from public representatives.  A local Garda Superintendent sometimes requests an appointment in a particular area in the public interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_3264">There is no qualifying examination involved but appointees are required to be of good character and they are usually well established in the local community.  Persons who are members of professions or employed in occupations which engage in legal work or related activities and members of the clergy are, as a matter of practice, not appointed because of their occupation and civil servants are usually only appointed where the performance of their official duties requires an appointment (i.e. <i>ex-officio</i>).  Persons convicted of serious offences are considered unsuitable for appointment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3265">The fact that an applicant or nominee may be suitable for appointment does not in itself provide any entitlement to appointment because appointments are made at the discretion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and having regard to the needs of particular areas.</p>

         if, in view of the fact that one large retailer (details supplied) has not signed up to the new voluntary Code of Practice On The Display And Sale Of Alcohol Products In Mixed Trading Premises, and as a result compliance with the voluntary code cannot be monitored at the large number of outlets here; his views on that the voluntary code is compromised; if he will commence with Section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 as he committed to if the voluntary code did not work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3271">Mr. Padraig White, Chairperson of Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland (RRAI), submitted the first compliance report on implementation of the Code of Practice on the Display and Sales of Alcohol Products in Mixed Trading Premises to me on 30 September.</p>
            <p eId="para_3272">In light of the high levels of compliance with the Code outlined in Mr. White's report, coupled with recent increases in RRAI membership which will ensure that a much greater number of mixed trading outlets will be subject to compliance audit in future years, I have concluded that implementation of section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 is not required at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3273">I circulated a copy of Mr. White's report, together with a covering note outlining my conclusion that implementation of section 9 is not required at this stage, to all Oireachtas members on 27 October. The report is also available on my Department's website <i>www.justice.ie.</i>

The Bill, which is currently being drafted, will modernise and streamline the law relating to the sale and consumption of alcohol by repealing the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2008, as well as the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008, and replacing them with updated provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3279">As regards consultation with relevant interests, my Department engaged in an extensive consultation process with stakeholders and other interested bodies, including public health, youth and medical organisations, during an earlier phase in the development of the Bill.  A further consultation was undertaken last year by the Government Alcohol Advisory Group in the context of preparing the Report and recommendations which provided the basis for the measures included in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008. Any further submissions from relevant groups and stakeholders will of course be carefully considered in the context of publication of the forthcoming Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_3813">The visa applications referred to by the Deputy were received in the Visa Office, Dublin on  16 September 2009.  They were refused by the Visa Officer on 22 September 2009 for the following reasons:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3814">1. The evidence of finances shown was deemed insufficient;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3815">2. There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the visa applications.  This is linked to the above refusal reason in that the financial documents submitted were internet banking copies which did not provide contact details for the financial institution concerned.  Details in respect of the documentation required in support of a visa application is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie);</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3816">3. The obligations to return to the home country were not deemed sufficient;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3817">4. It was the opinion of the Visa Officer that the applicants may not observe the conditions of the visas, if granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_3818">It is open to the persons concerned to submit an appeal within two months of the date of visa refusal, in this case before 22 November 2009.  Correspondence notifying the applicants of the visa refusals issued from the Honorary Consulate, Karachi on 24 September 2009.  Guidelines on making an appeal are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service <i>(www.inis.gov.ie).</i>

            <p eId="para_3820">The Programme for Government 2007 contained a commitment to task the Garda Inspectorate with assessing the need to establish a dedicated Missing Persons Unit, including a response network similar to Amber Alert in the USA.</p>
            <p eId="para_3821">I consequently asked the Garda Síochána Inspectorate to assess the need to establish a dedicated Missing Persons Unit within An Garda Síochána including a response network similar to Amber Alert and to report their findings to me.  The Inspectorate published their report earlier this year, and I welcomed their recommendations on the handling of missing persons cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_3822">The Inspectorate report found overall that Garda systems for handling missing persons cases are in line with international best practice and has made recommendations on how those systems can be further enhanced.  One of its recommendations was that the Garda Missing Persons Bureau continue to advise and assist in high risk missing person cases leaving direct, day to day responsibility to District Superintendents and their personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_3823">I am informed by the Garda authorities that local investigation teams are appointed by the District Officer and all means necessary, including the services of specialist units, are deployed to assist in these investigations.  The Missing Persons Bureau provides expert assistance and advice to District officers in all high risk missing person cases.  I am further informed that the Garda authorities are satisfied that adequate resources, including staff and technological resources, are in place to deal with missing persons cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_3836">Firstly, it is open to any individual to seek a visa on the basis of being the partner of an Irish citizen.

            <p eId="para_3837">Marriage to an Irish National does not grant any automatic right to enter or reside in the State solely on that basis; the same applies to partners.

            <p eId="para_3838">In the cases of both spouses and partners, evidence of the bona fides of a pre-existing relationship is of paramount importance.

            <p eId="para_3853">Section 17 of the Immigration Act 2004 sets out the purposes for which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can make a Visa Order declaring that members of specified classes of non-nationals are not required to be in possession of an Irish visa when landing in the State.  At present, nationals of Mauritius are not visa required as set out in Statutory Instrument No. 239 of 2009.  However, with effect from 1 January 2010, this position will change and nationals of Mauritius will require an entry visa.</p>
            <p eId="para_3854">The agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Mauritius provides for visa free travel for a maximum period of three months and does not cover travel for the purposes of paid activity.  The agreement is binding only on the member states that fully apply the Schengen acquis and so, Ireland is not bound by it or subject to its application.</p>
            <p eId="para_3855">In maintaining the Common Travel Area (CTA) that Ireland shares with the UK both States co-operate to ensure that their respective Visa Lists cohere as much as possible in all practical respects to the extent warranted by immigration concerns.  However, it does not preclude divergence by either State.  It should be noted that in the UK, all non-EEA or non-Swiss nationals are visa-required if they are coming for more than six months.  The Irish system operates on the basis that, depending on his or her nationality, the visitor is either visa required or not, irrespective of the length of their stay.</p>
            <p eId="para_3856">Visa and pre-entry clearance systems are at the core of immigration controls and the inclusion of nationalities on lists of persons who require visas is usually the result of experience regarding the nationalities concerned.  There are currently over 5,000 Mauritian nationals registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, mostly as students.  Taking the population of Mauritius as being approximately 1.25 million this means that one in every 250 Mauritian nationals is in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3857">The Mauritian authorities have been informed by our Department of Foreign Affairs of this change in the visa requirement.  Information has been placed on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in this regard.</p>

        <b>Deputy Róisín Shortall</b>

         if his attention has been drawn to the public concern about the increasing availability of alcohol to minors through home deliveries; his views on the severe difficulties in enforcing the law in this regard; and if he will give consideration to banning such deliveries in order to help combat the abuse of alcohol among minors.

            <p eId="para_3866">It is already an offence under section 31(2) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended) for a licence holder to sell or deliver, or permit any other person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor for consumption by a person under the age of 18 years in any place except with the explicit consent of the person's parent or guardian in a private residence in which he or she is present either as of right or with permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_3867">During discussions leading up to enactment of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008, I undertook to examine the need for any additional statutory provisions to prohibit third parties from purchasing and then delivering intoxicating liquor, including such deliveries to persons under the age of 18 years.  I intend to address this matter in the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_3868">I should add that new statutory provisions in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 enable the Garda to confiscate intoxicating liquor found in the possession of minors in public places.  It also enables the Garda to confiscate intoxicating liquor in the possession of persons over the age of 18 years of age in order to prevent public disorder or damage to property.  I am confident that these provisions have strengthened the capacity of the Garda to deal with problems arising from the consumption of intoxicating liquor in public places.</p>

            <p eId="para_3888">Valid applications for certificates of naturalisation from the persons referred to in the Deputy's question were received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in December 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3889">All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of both applications has commenced and the files will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_3890">The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_3892">I can confirm that the question of plea bargaining and the factors that might be relevant to its operation in this jurisdiction have been reviewed, most notably by the Law Reform Commission in its 1996 Report on Sentencing.  The Commission decided against making any recommendations on legislation in the area of plea negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3893">The current practice is set out in the Director of Public Prosecutions' Guidelines for Prosecutors.  I refer the Deputy to chapter 10 of those Guidelines.  These Guidelines are available on the Director of Public Prosecution's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_3894">The criminal law already makes a limited allowance where the defendant enters a guilty plea.  Section 29 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, together with some more specific provisions such as section 27(3D)(<i>b</i>) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, provide that an early plea of guilty should, as a general rule, be taken into consideration by the court when determining the appropriate sentence (in cases other than where the sentence is fixed by law).

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3896">The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Jurisprudence since then has established as a Constitutional right the provision of aid in such circumstances.  An applicant for criminal legal aid must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal aid and the court must also be satisfied that by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  However, where the charge is one of murder or where an appeal is one from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court, free legal aid is granted merely on the grounds of insufficient means.</p>
            <p eId="para_3897">The courts, therefore, through the Judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  The Deputy will appreciate that eligibility for legal aid in criminal cases is determined by the Judge hearing the case and that I have no function in this regard.  However, I have been concerned about the mounting expenditure on criminal legal aid.  In that context, I am bringing forward a Bill to amend the current system with a view to ensuring that, while accused persons of insufficient means who are facing serious charges are entitled to have a defence provided for them, there are tight controls against any abuse of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3898">The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 created a new offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for the offence of participation or involvement in organised crime has been increased from five years to 15 years imprisonment.  While the Garda authorities are already making use of its provisions, it will take some time before they are in a position to bring criminals before the courts.  It will remain a matter for the court to determine eligibility for criminal legal aid in respect of any charges brought under this new legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3899">The monthly expenditure on criminal legal aid from 2005 to end October 2009 is set out in tabular form below.</p>

        <b>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</b>

        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
         the number of prisoners released in the past 24 months; the number who have served their sentences in full; the number who were on special release; the number who committed crimes after release; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4115">There is no provision for special release in the Irish prison system.  Statistics pertaining to the level of temporary release from prison are contained in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 300 of today.</p>
            <p eId="para_4116">It is not possible to provide the other figures requested by the Deputy as this would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4117">However, I can provide some information pertaining to the year 2008.  In that year there were 13,557 instances of committal to prison involving 10,928 individuals.  These committals comprised of:</p>
            <p eId="para_4118">7,461 under sentence, 3,526 of which were for less than 3 months and 65 of which were for ten years or more;</p>
            <p eId="para_4119">5,052 on remand;</p>
            <p eId="para_4120">1,034 for immigration related matters, 759 of whom spent less than 8 days in prison;</p>
            <p eId="para_4121">10 for contempt of court.</p>
            <p eId="para_4122">I also wish to advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service facilitated a major study of prisoner re-offending by the UCD Institute of Criminology.  The study found that 27.4% of released prisoners were serving a new prison sentence within one year.  This rose to 39.2% after two years, 45.1% after three years, and 49.2% after four years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4123">The Irish Prison Service provides a range of rehabilitative programmes which have the dual purpose of providing prisoners with purposeful activity while serving their sentences and encouraging and equipping them to lead productive lives on release.  Prisoner rehabilitation involves significant multi-dimensional input by a diverse range of general and specialist services provided both by the Irish Prison Service and in-reach statutory and non-statutory services.  Amongst these are healthcare, psychiatric, psychological, educational, work and training, vocational, counselling, welfare and spiritual services.  These services are important in addressing offending behaviour, drug and alcohol addiction, missed educational and vocational opportunities, anger management, and self management in the interest of encouraging positive personal development in prisoners, and preparing them for re-integration and resettlement on release from custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_4124">In addition, the Probation Service has an active role during the course of the prisoner's sentence in helping maintain links with family and community agencies, encouraging prisoners to address their offending behaviour and engaging prisoners in individual counselling and group counselling programmes such as offending behaviour, addiction, violence and sex offending.</p>

         the average number of prisoners on day, early or special release in each week in the past 24 months; the degree to which the numbers have fluctuated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4126">It is not possible to provide figures to the Deputy as requested as this would require the manual examination of records going back over a considerable time period.  Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4127">However I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that the number of prisoners on temporary release on 6 November 2009 was 644.  This represented 14% of the overall prisoner population for this day.  In contrast, the percentage for the years 1994 to 1997 are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_4128">1994  — (22.2%);</p>
            <p eId="para_4129">1995  — (20.2%);</p>
            <p eId="para_4130">1996  — (17.9%);</p>
            <p eId="para_4131">1997  — (19.2%).</p>
            <p eId="para_4132">The highest number of prisoners on temporary release on any one date in 2009 was 686 on 24 June 2009.  This represented 15% of the overall population on that date.  The daily average figure to date in 2009 for prisoners on temporary release is 510 and this represents 12% of the daily population figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_4133">The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to well-behaved prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_4134">Temporary release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide.  They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.  In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda.</p>
            <p eId="para_4135">Candidates for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons.  The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession.  Recommendations are also made in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board.  It is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect.  Before a final determination a number of factors are taken into account including:</p>
            <p eId="para_4136">the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates;</p>
            <p eId="para_4137">the sentence concerned and any recommendation made by the Court in relation to the sentence imposed;</p>
            <p eId="para_4138">the period of the sentence served by the person;</p>
            <p eId="para_4139">the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released;</p>
            <p eId="para_4140">the person's previous criminal record;</p>
            <p eId="para_4141">the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release;</p>
            <p eId="para_4142">the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release;</p>
            <p eId="para_4143">any report or recommendation made by the Governor, the Garda Síochána, a Probation and Welfare Officer, or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release;</p>
            <p eId="para_4144">the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release;</p>
            <p eId="para_4145">the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the specific conditions of temporary release laid down;</p>
            <p eId="para_4146">the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4251">As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and do not have the option of refusing committals. It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 330.  This represents a 9% rise in the number in custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_4252">Since 1997, the Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  A new accommodation block for 123 prisoners recently opened at Castlerea Prison.  Furthermore, current projects will also provide the potential for an additional 750 prison spaces during 2009 and 2010 by means of:</p>
            <p eId="para_4253">a new block in Portlaoise Prison which will have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners and which has recently started to accommodate prisoners;</p>
            <p eId="para_4254">a new block in Wheatfield Prison which will also have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners which is due to open by end of 2009;</p>
            <p eId="para_4255">opening the separation unit in Mountjoy Prison which will have the potential to accommodate 50 prisoners and is due to open by the end of this month;</p>
            <p eId="para_4256">a new wing at the Portlaoise/Midlands complex will have the potential to accommodate 300 prisoners.  Work is due to commence in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4257">In the longer term, the Government remains firmly committed to replacing the prisons on the Mountjoy complex with modern prison accommodation at Thornton Hall. Building new prison facilities at Thornton Hall on a green field site will open up new opportunities for the development of structured regime activities that support rehabilitation and resettlement of prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_4258">In developing its design concept for Thornton Hall the Irish Prison Service sought and continues to seek to deliver a modern, operationally efficient and cost effective facility which will provide decent living conditions for prisoners with appropriate support programmes including the provision of modern facilities for prison staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_4276">I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 to 307, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4277">The law takes a serious view of offences committed by persons on bail.  The Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides for mandatory consecutive sentences to apply where a person is convicted of an offence committed while on bail.  In addition, the law provides that the fact that an offence was committed while on bail must be treated as an aggravating factor at sentencing and that the court shall impose a sentence that is greater than that which would have been imposed otherwise, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4278">There have been concerns at how, in practice, our bail laws have been operating, and these led to the inclusion in the Criminal Justice Act, 2007 of a series of new provisions designed to tighten up on the granting of bail.  These allow the prosecution to mount a more effective challenge to bail applications.  For example, applicants for bail can be required to provide a statement of their means so that the prosecution can highlight any divergence their between their lifestyles and their stated means as evidence of their involvement in gangland activity.  The Director of Public Prosecution is now able to appeal to the High Court against a decision of the District Court to grant bail and against the conditions attached by the District Court to the bail.</p>
            <p eId="para_4279">I am asking the Government this week to approve my proposal to commence work on a new Bail Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.  In preparing the Bill I will address a number of weaknesses in the current law to ensure that the bail regime can operate in as tight and effective a way as possible.  I will also examine the extent to which the law could be restated to better guide the courts on the need to protect the public against those who present an unacceptable risk of committing a serious offence if granted bail.</p>
            <p eId="para_4280">The Garda Síochána Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_4281">I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</p>

            <p eId="para_4286">Ireland has worked closely with our EU partners in maintaining a consistent approach to Zimbabwe.  The EU operates targeted restrictive measures against individuals and businesses which have supported or participated in the destruction wrought by President Mugabe and his close associates within ZANU PF.</p>
            <p eId="para_4287">I am concerned at reports of a commercial involvement between the company referred to and a farm which it would appear was seized illegally by the wife of President Mugabe.  However, Ireland has no independent means of assessing the extent or directness of the commercial connection referred to.  The company concerned confirmed subsequently that it has severed this commercial relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_4288">I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Finance that, with regard to the investment held by the National Pensions Reserve (NPRF) in the company, the NPRF Commission has a policy of engagement with companies where environmental, social and governance issues arise.  Engagement is a process whereby shareholders initiate dialogue with the boards and management of a company to seek to address issues of concern.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission has appointed Hermes Equity Ownership Services to engage with companies on its behalf across its global equity portfolio. In the light of concerns raised about foreign investment in Zimbabwe, the NPRF has engaged, through Hermes, with a number of companies concerning their activities in that country, including the company referred to by the Deputy.  It is important to note that the issues raised concerning Zimbabwe relate not to investments by the Fund in Zimbabwe itself, but to investments in a number of multinational companies which have investments across the globe.</p>
            <p eId="para_4289">I am also advised that the investment mandate of the NPRF Commission, as set out in section 19 of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000, provides that the Fund shall be invested so as to secure the optimal financial return provided the level of risk to the moneys invested is acceptable to the Commission.  The mandate is not qualified by any ethical investment criteria. However, the Minister for Finance has established an Interdepartmental Committee to consider the issue of an ethical investment policy for the NPRF. The Committee is preparing a report which is expected to be finalised shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_4290">Ireland will remain engaged, both bilaterally and with our EU partners, to support a return to democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe, and an end to the humanitarian crisis and human rights abuses which have had such a devastating effect on its people.  It is vital for the future of Zimbabwe that the power sharing government delivers on the promise of reform, and secures for Zimbabwe's people real political freedoms, a return to the rule of law and economic development.  Ireland will continue to work with our partners in the international community to encourage progress in these areas.</p>

I have made it clear that there is no prospect of reaching consensus at EU level in favour of such a policy.  In these circumstances, to link this issue with the discussion of the Goldstone report serves to make more difficult a clear and constructive discussion on the report and the important issues it addresses.  The Government has made it clear, in debates at the Human Rights Council in Geneva and the United Nations General Assembly in New York, its support for the Goldstone report as a serious investigation which needs to be considered carefully and acted on.  Ireland was one of five EU member states which voted in favour of the resolution on the report at the General Assembly last week.

            <p eId="para_4296">The Government has made it clear in international debates at the Human Rights Council in Geneva and most recently at the UN General Assembly in New York, that it supports the Goldstone report and attaches importance to it.  Ireland was one of five EU member states to vote in support of the resolution on the report at the UN General Assembly last week.  The report is a complex and detailed document.  Its recommendations cover wide-ranging actions in many national and international fora, with wide and far-reaching political and legal implications.  In common with many countries, we will need to consider carefully these implications before agreeing on the best way forward on these crucial issues.  In the first instance, the report calls for the parties to the Gaza conflict to institute credible and transparent investigations into the alleged breaches of international law which it details, investigations which are in conformity with international standards and which can command confidence.  We fully support the report's recommendations in this regard.  The other recommendations, including that referred to by the Deputy, are put forward as alternative mechanisms if those investigations do not take place.  They would need to be considered at that stage, if necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_4298">The Irish United Nations Association is a non-governmental organisation that is based in Dublin.  Its objectives are to promote the aims and activities of the United Nations and its specialised agencies in Ireland.  The association has received funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs since 1972.  In addition to this funding, my Department has also provided support to the association in terms of advice on strategy and internal governance procedures.  In 2007-08, my Department, in co-operation with the association, conducted two extensive reports which produced a series of recommendations identifying reforms geared to better enabling the association to fulfil its mandate.  Consultations are ongoing with the Irish United Nations Association on how to ensure an appropriate follow-up to the two reports.  The proposal to cease funding of the association is one of a number of recommendations made in the McCarthy report in relation to expenditure by this Department.  Those recommendations are being examined by the Government in the context of preparations for the 2010 budget.  In the meantime, I have recently written to the association outlining proposals to address their immediate financial situation, in line with our existing commitment to support its activities.</p>

The officers were appointed on two-year contracts to provide opportunities for people with a disability to participate in sport and physical activity.  A network of 33 local sports partnerships have been set up throughout the country by the Irish Sports Council to co-ordinate and promote sport at local level, especially among specific target groups such as older people, girls and women, people with disabilities, unemployed people and those who live in identified disadvantaged communities.  The special dormant accounts funding was in addition to the annual funding provided to the local sports partnerships by the Irish Sports Council for programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing participation in recreational sport.  The council has allocated €6 million to the local sports partnerships in 2009.  The continuation of the sports inclusion development officer scheme from 2010 will depend on negotiations on the 2010 Estimates.</p>

            <p eId="para_4305">The Exchequer contribution of a sector can generally be derived from the official national accounts.  In the case of tourism, however, the conventional means of presenting official national accounts do not allow for it to be presented as a distinct sector, due to its fragmented nature.  There are a number of alternative means by which its contribution can be estimated, of which the production of tourism satellite accounts is considered to be the most robust, although complex and costly.  In the absence of regular tourism satellite accounts, Fáilte Ireland, with assistance from external experts in the area, has developed an economic model to estimate the value of tourism's contribution, based on available data.  It is a generalised input-output model using an integrated supply and demand framework which links tourist expenditure on products to the supply of products by industry.  Using multipliers to measure the direct, indirect and induced effects of tourism expenditure, it was estimated that total tourism revenue in 2008 represented some 4% of gross national product in revenue terms, equivalent to 2.2% of gross value added or 2.6% of gross domestic product.  Figures for total out-of-State and domestic tourism revenue are based primarily on the estimates produced by the Central Statistics Office through its tourism-related surveys, the passenger card inquiry for overseas visitors and the household travel survey for domestic tourists, as well as data from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board for Northern Ireland resident visits and overseas visitors arriving via Northern Ireland.  Fáilte Ireland's survey of overseas travellers allows estimation of the contribution of key overseas segments such as activity tourists, conference visitors, language students, etc. — segments that are not identified in the CSO estimates.  Applying the Fáilte Ireland economic model, it is estimated that, in 2008, the Exchequer earned €1.5 billion through taxation of tourism spend, of which €1.1 billion came from foreign tourism.</p>

However, it will be forwarded to the Deputy in due course.  For a variety of reasons it can take grantees several years to draw down allocations.  Some of the more common reasons for this include delays in finalising the legalities required to protect the State's investment, delays in the planning process and construction and difficulties in raising the required own funding.  While my Department seeks to give grantees every opportunity to draw down allocation, where delays are excessive, or the project has ceased, my Department seeks to withdraw allocations.  This is a labour intensive and time consuming process, although in 2008 it was possible to withdraw €6.6 million of previous years allocations.  Some €56 million has been provided in my Department's vote in the 2009 Estimates to cover payments to be made from the C1 subhead, out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities.  All of this money must be spent before the end of the year.  The corresponding figure for 2008 was €58 million.  In 2009, it has been business as usual for grantees allocated funding under previous rounds of the programme.  By close of business on Friday, 6 November last, over 1,360 payments had been approved with a total value of over €50 million.  It is the intention to meet existing commitments made to grantees under the programme, subject to their compliance with the relevant criteria required for the payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4329">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 121 of 21 October last.  The procurement phase of the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall is progressing.  In accordance with the Government decision, it is a design, build, finance and maintain PPP project.  Two participating consortia submitted tenders on 25 September 2009 for the project.  These tenders are being evaluated at present.  This stage of the process should be competed around the end of this year.  As this is a PPP process, costs are determined at the time of contract conclusion.  The Commissioners for Public Works acquired the site at Earlsfort Terrace from University College Dublin on behalf of the State in October 2006 for the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall.  The purchase price was €41.8 million.  An evaluation of the economic benefits of the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall was carried out in 2006 and the Departments of Arts, Sport and Tourism and Finance were satisfied with the outcome of this evaluation.  I have no doubt that the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall will make a very substantial contribution to the arts and provide considerable benefits to the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_4333">As I have previously indicated, my view is that a focused programme with a single integrated delivery structure is needed to maximise the impact of the local development programme and the community development programme, which serve disadvantaged communities.  My overall aim is to ensure that, from 2010, having regard to the budgetary position, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focused programme with clear objectives, simplified and streamlined delivery structures and better-integrated actions, leading to significant administrative savings.  The Department is undertaking a review of the community development programme.  I expect shortly to have a full report on its findings and recommendations.  I would reasonably expect the majority of projects to be endorsed by the review and to move into the new integrated programme.  The intention is to preserve elements of best practice from the existing community development programme and local development social inclusion programmes in the redesigned model, to minimise structures and to enhance benefits for individuals and communities through significant administrative and overhead savings.  Clearly, these developments are taking place at a time of extreme budgetary difficulties, the full extent of which will not be known until budget day.  As regards the recommendations of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, these are being considered by Government and no decisions have been made as yet.</p>

            <p eId="para_4457">Jobseekers Allowance and Farm Assist are both means tested payments.  The manner in which means are to be assessed are set out in the Third Schedule of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  In most such cases, a Social Welfare Inspector will interview the claimant and make such inquiries as are necessary to ascertain the means of the applicant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4458">The Department produces administrative guidelines to assist inspectors in this task. These guidelines are supplemented from time to time to take account of changing legislation or circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4459">Legislation provides that a person's income in the coming 12 months is the basis of his/her means.  The means assessment guidelines state that where the income in the coming 12 months is not otherwise ascertainable and this is usually the case, the income for the last 12 months should be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary.</p>
            <p eId="para_4460">Historically self-employed persons tended to be assessed with their income in the 12 months prior to claiming, and a decision was given on that basis.  This was in the context of the relatively stable economic conditions.  However, it was always the case that where an applicant had ceased self employment and could demonstrate this or where an applicant could justifiably maintain that their income in the coming 12 months was likely to be greatly reduced in light of circumstances which could include personal or economic circumstances, then Inspectors and Deciding Officers would always take account of this, and exercise their best judgement as to the likely income a person would receive in the 12 months following their claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_4461">In light of the changed economic climate, and recognising that the system of using past-year earnings as a basis for assessing means was no longer as suitable in all cases, the Department issued a circular in May 2008 advising Inspectors of this and pointing out that in light of changed economic circumstances, it would generally be the case that less work was going to be available to a claimant in the foreseeable future. Inspectors were advised that they should thoroughly question any applicant in this regard and apply their knowledge of local conditions to arrive at a fair assessment of their income from self-employment in the coming 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_4462">If a self employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for Jobseekers Allowance or Farm Assist, they can apply to have their means reviewed in the light of the changed circumstances.  In addition, it is open to the individual, if he or she is dissatisfied with the means assessed, to make an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_4463">In the meantime it is important to remember that people who have urgent income support needs can apply for the means tested Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) and more than 95% of basic SWA applications are decided on, and paid, within the week.</p>
            <p eId="para_4464">I appreciate the need to ensure that claimants who have been self employed, and whose income is significantly affected by the economic downturn, receive their full and fair entitlements in a timely manner, and I assure the House that we are doing our best to achieve this.</p>

At certain times, due to peaks in the number of incoming calls, callers may encounter some difficulties in getting through to certain areas of the Department.  A number of initiatives to minimise delays for callers have been introduced.  These include a new telephony system and call management software as well as new organisational arrangements.  These initiatives have resulted in a noticeable improvement in telephone response times and overall call management.

            <p eId="para_4933">I propose to take Questions Nos. 349 and 352 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4934">On 21 July 2004 the Government approved the Heads of a Bill in order to implement the recommendations arising from the Inter-Departmental Task Force Report.  Drafting of the legislation commenced shortly thereafter.  In the course of that process, certain strategic, procedural and technical issues arose relating to the role of the proposed Statutory Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_4935">The main technical issue relates to the demarcation of roles between the Minister and the Authority.  This concerns the use of lands by the Defence Forces that would be the responsibility of the proposed Authority but over which the Minister is the final arbiter in the event of any dispute.  This potentially raises a conflict between the role of the Minister as the Minister with responsibility for the Defence Forces and the Minister's role as head of the Department under whose aegis the Authority would operate.</p>
            <p eId="para_4936">Further issues have arisen in the context of value for money considerations.  The establishment of the Authority as a separate agency under the aegis of my Department would involve additional costs in terms of staff, accommodation, expenses and payments to members of the Authority, which would be significantly greater than the costs incurred by my Department currently in administering the Curragh Lands.  Deputies will be aware that the Government has targeted the rationalisation of State agencies as a key cost saving measure.  In that context it would be inappropriate and, indeed, costly to establish a separate agency to manage work currently being done successfully, efficiently and economically by the staff in my Department.  Given the requirements of administrative efficiency, and the technical issues raised in relation to the role of the Minister as the final arbiter in disputes relating to the use of the Curragh Lands, I have decided not to proceed with the establishment of the Authority, which was a primary focus of the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_4937">The way forward now will involve a review by my Department of the varying usage of the lands by a range of different interests in the Curragh, not least the Defence Forces, with a view to establishing how these can be best accommodated and managed within the existing administrative framework and within existing resources.  The Value for Money review of the Defence Forces Training Lands, which is nearing completion, will also feed into this process.  The question of the requirement for legislation to address any other issues in relation to the Curragh Lands can then be examined in this context.  This work will proceed as resources allow, given the competing demands on the Department's staff and resources and the need to prioritise issues and allocate reducing resources to the core Defence policy and operational issues.</p>

Under the Pathways to Home model, adopted by the Homeless Agency, every individual who is seeking accommodation due to homelessness, whether they were evicted or otherwise, will have their needs assessed by the relevant local authority and, subject to the outcome of their needs assessment, will be provided with appropriate accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_5355">My Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is seeking to resolve the issue of horse dung in Killarney National Park by requiring that jaunting cars must be equipped with dung-catching devices when entering the Park.</p>
            <p eId="para_5356">On 29 July 2009, the High Court refused to grant an injunction to a number of jarveys seeking to prevent NPWS from excluding them from Killarney National Park for their failure to use dung-catching devices.  In a comprehensive judgment affirming the action of the NPWS, the judge recommended that the parties should move forward in a peaceful way, and, in that regard, the NPWS put in place an independent facilitator to facilitate the introduction of the dung catchers. In the event, however, the jarveys refused to engage with the person appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5357">There has been a long process of consultations, over some two years, with the Jarveys.  In addition, practical trialing of the devices has been carried out and repeated demonstrations of their use have been provided by NPWS.  These demonstrations, backed up by expert equine and veterinary advice, show that the dung catchers work and are safe to use.  The NPWS made its experts available for discussion and consultation but this was not availed of by the jarveys who did not engage in any meaningful way on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_5358">The issue of dung in Killarney National Park has been a matter of public concern for many years and there have been different views on how to deal with it. Following a long consultation process with the Jarveys, my Department prepared a report outlining the different views and the pros and cons of alternative options; a decision in relation to this matter was taken in February 2009 on the basis of this report.</p>

The BER certificate and advisory report serve to enable prospective purchasers or tenants to take the energy performance of a building into account when making decisions in relation to sales or lettings and to compare in a standard format the energy performance of a range of buildings available to them. There are no proposals under consideration in my Department at present in relation to varying the legal requirement for the production of BER certificates and advisory reports in situations where a vendor or a lessor may be forced to sell or lease a property.</p>

Sections 59-78 of the Act give planning authorities powers with regard to the protection of protected structures including powers to require works to be carried out in relation to endangerment of protected structures and to require restoration of the character of protected structures.  Under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 I am generally precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case, including an enforcement matter, with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.

            <p eId="para_5446">I propose to take Questions Nos. 363 to 366, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5447">Regarding the issue of any studies in regard to human health the Government has noted the outcomes of the independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions on Haulbowline which was carried out for my Department in 2008. This comprised three distinct modules: assessing quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in the vicinity; assessment of any health or environmental risks posed by current site conditions; and ambient air monitoring.</p>
            <p eId="para_5448">The consultants who undertook the assessment had available the advice of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Institute and the Health and Safety Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5449">Ambient air monitoring was undertaken in accordance with relevant national and international occupational exposure limit values, finding that air quality complied with all relevant standards and guidelines, including in Cobh which was the main population centre that was monitored, and that there is no occupational risk to human health from airborne substances.  Similarly, the assessment of water, sediment and mussel samples employed the relevant applicable screening criteria and found no identifiable risk to the residents of Cork Harbour.</p>
            <p eId="para_5450">In the case of assessing the health and environmental risks posed by potential contaminants in the waste material on the East Tip area of the site the screening was undertaken using human health generic assessment criteria which are derived from guidance issued in the UK.  These criteria were considered most appropriate for the site, are conservative for on-site exposures for current land use, and did not suggest a risk to health of people on site undertaking normal activities or to those in the Cork harbour area including the Naval Base.</p>
            <p eId="para_5451">The earlier 2005 site investigation reported ground conditions on the East Tip portion of the island as comprising waste material to a depth of between 4.0m to 12.5m and comprising various wastes that largely originated from the steel making processes on Haulbowline Island together with other wastes types deposited during its development.  Given the uncontrolled nature of the deposition of material on the site over several decades the volumes of the various wastes are extremely difficult accurately to quantify.  Both the 2005 and 2008 site assessments, which are available in the Oireachtas library, deal extensively with the waste sampling and analysis undertaken for all waste types, including heavy metals.</p>
            <p eId="para_5452">As previously advised, the Government has decided that the Office of Public Works will chair a working group to develop a structured and coherent approach to the further management and development of the site.  The establishment of this group is a matter for the OPW.</p>
            <p eId="para_5453">Future funding requirements are contingent on determination as to the future use of the site.  From 2007 to date the State has expended a total of €45,632,211.47 on investigations, demolitions, various site works, disposal of waste material, testing and sampling, analysis, topographical and foreshore ecological surveys, archaeological surveys, project management, peer review, small service contracts, wages, professional fees, utilities and security.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_5464">The housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, continues to provide a robust framework for addressing housing priorities in the years ahead.  Considerable progress has been made on implementation of the programme and policy reforms outlined in the policy statement since its publication in February 2007.  Relevant sections of my Department's Annual Reports and Annual Output Statements for 2007 and 2008, which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department's website, www.environ.ie, provide comprehensive information in relation to the progress made by my Department on housing matters, particularly in terms of delivery under the various housing programmes, since the launch of the statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5465">The financial provision for housing for 2009, some €1.4 billion, is enabling us to maintain a continued high level of momentum in meeting social housing needs.  Taking all the social housing programmes together, including those of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, and having regard to the capacity to access suitable housing available in the current housing market, including through the long-term leasing initiative, some 7,000 completions are expected to be achieved this year.  My Department is committed to continuing to optimise the delivery of social housing by tailoring the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions, and by exploring alternative solutions to addressing housing needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the policy statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5466">Considerable progress has been made also on the reform programme outlined in the policy statement.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which gives effect to a range of social housing reform measures, many of which were outlined in the statement, was enacted in July 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5467">Among the provisions of the Act are measures relating to the adoption by housing authorities of housing services plans for the delivery of social and affordable housing supports, homelessness action plans and anti-social behaviour strategies, new and more objective methods of assessing need and allocating housing and a more effective management and control regime covering issues such as tenancies and rents.  Work is now under way in my Department to bring the various provisions of the Act into operation and to prepare the necessary supporting regulations and guidelines to allow for full implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5468">In addition to these developments a new homelessness strategy was published last year and I expect work on a National Housing Strategy for People with a Disability, which is under way in my Department currently, to be completed early in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5469">Actions have also been taken to improve housing quality and design.

            <p eId="para_5477">Allocations totalling €79.562 million for 2009 were notified to local authorities under the Housing Adaptation Grant for Older People and People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Grant Scheme and the former Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes on 7 May 2009.  In the case of South Tipperary County Council, the 2009 allocation amounted to €1,530,000 compared to an initial allocation of €1,343,550 in 2008, an increase of almost 14%.</p>
            <p eId="para_5478">While my Department has not been formally advised of any local authorities having discontinued the schemes in their areas, they are very heavily subscribed and available funding has been heavily committed in many areas.  Having regard to this, and the continued priority which the Government attaches to the schemes, and following an evaluation of the ongoing level of demand for grants, the level of expenditure to date and the capacity of local authorities to process and approve additional applications in the current year, I approved a supplementary allocation of approximately €12.5 million to some 26 local authorities on 12 October, 2009. In that context, South Tipperary County Council received a supplementary allocation of €663,750, bringing its total allocation for 2009 to €2,193,750.</p>

            <p eId="para_5480">Strategic Development Zones were introduced in the Planning and Development Act 2000 to ensure that sites considered to be of strategic national importance in economic or social terms can be developed with a much greater degree of certainty both in relation to securing planning permission and the time horizon for development.  This does not involve any weakening of control systems but provides a means of resolving the major planning issues before an individual project is developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5481">One of the significant benefits arising from SDZ designation is that a planning authority can grant permission in respect of an application for a development within an SDZ with no right of appeal, where it is satisfied that the development would be consistent with the adopted SDZ planning scheme, which itself has been subject to extensive consultation and may have been considered by An Bord Pleanála, thus providing greater certainty and a speedier decision-making process.</p>

            <p eId="para_5485">The attributed cause of these fatalities, as reported by the fire authorities, and the presence or otherwise of smoke alarms at these incidents, are indicated in the following tables 1 and 2.  Over half the fatal fire incidents occurred where there was no smoke alarm or no working smoke alarm on the premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_5486">The theme of this year's National Fire Safety Week, held at the start of October was "Working Smoke Alarms Save Lives".  The week marks the commencement of an annual fire safety promotion campaign which is held on an all-island basis. The campaign raises awareness of the importance of having working smoke alarms in dwellings and ensuring batteries are checked at regular intervals.  The media campaign, which includes television and radio, press, on-line and outdoor advertising, will run until February 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_5571">As Minister, my role is to provide the necessary statutory and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority. The adoption of individual development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_5572">Each planning authority is also required to include details of contributions received in that year, together with information on how the contributions have been expended, in the statutory annual accounts of the authority.  A new requirement was introduced for the financial year 2008 to include details in the annual financial statement of all accrued uncollected levies due to the planning authority; the 2008 statements will be the subject of a full audit by the Local Government Audit Service during the audit cycle 2009-2010. My Department does not, therefore, have up-to-date information on the amount of development contributions owed to each planning authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5573">As with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of any outstanding development contributions is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal accountancy procedures.</p>

            <p eId="para_5600">The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, published in June 2009, provides an amendment to section 42 of the Planning and Development Acts, which currently provides that the duration of a planning permission must be extended, subject to certain conditions, where substantial works have been carried out before the expiration of the original permission.</p>
            <p eId="para_5601">The proposed amendment provides for the extension of permission (for a period of up to 5 years) in circumstances where substantial works have not been carried out, but there are commercial, economic or technical considerations, beyond the control of the applicant, which substantially militated against either the commencement of development or the carrying out of substantial works.</p>

            <p eId="para_5608">I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 and 385 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5609">While action to deal with anti-social behaviour is primarily a matter for An Garda Síochána, in the case of private rented dwellings landlords are responsible for enforcing the obligations that apply to their tenants under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_5610">The Act, in this regard, prohibits a tenant in a private residential tenancy from engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies and allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such behaviour, subject to a notice period of only seven days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious but persistent behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_5611">The Residential Tenancies Act also provides that a third party affected by anti-social behaviour may, subject to certain conditions, take a case to the Private Residential Tenancies Board against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations. A specific condition is that the third party complainant must have taken reasonable steps to resolve the matter by communicating or attempting to communicate with the parties to the tenancy concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_5612">I have recently announced the preliminary outcomes of a review of the Act and as part of this I have identified a number of issues that require further consideration. One such issue is that of third party complaints under the Act, particularly as they relate to anti-social behaviour matters. Details of the preliminary outcomes of the review are available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie .</p>

This role will be underpinned further by provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 relating to statutory local Homelessness Action Plans, Homelessness Consultative Fora and Management Groups, which, when commenced shortly, will result in an enhanced framework and process for planning, co-ordination, delivery and monitoring of homeless services in each area.</p>

Details of broadband availability throughout the country are available at www.broadband.gov.ie.  I would add that information contained on this website is provided by the service providers. EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers.  Accordingly, the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which was approved by the EU Commission, is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  For this reason, Carrowmenagh is not within the NBS area.</p>

            <p eId="para_5702">Up to 2007 payments in respect of designated Natura sites were not separately identified but formed part of the overall REPS 3 Scheme in operation at that time. Under the Rural Development Programme 2007 — 2013 payments for designated Natura sites may be made to a beneficiary approved to participate in the Rural Environmental Protection Scheme (REPS 4) which was introduced in 2007. A person not wishing to join REPS 4 may seek funding under a scheme operated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government which has responsibility for the designation and protection of these sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_5703">EU funding of €220m has been allocated to Natura payments over the lifetime of the Rural Development Programme. This must be matched by national funding at the rate of 45%. This is an indicative amount only however as take up of the support is voluntary and at the discretion of the farmer. In 2008 close on €8m was spent in respect of Natura 2000 sites under REPS 4 while it is estimated that a further €10m will be paid in respect of 2009 applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_5704">EU funds will continue to be expended on Natura sites for existing REPS 4 participants until the Programme comes to an end in 2013. In addition a Natura measure is planned as part of the proposed new agri environment scheme. Spending under Natura 2000 is monitored on a regular basis and re-allocation of these funds can be considered in the event of an under spend on this measure.</p>

            <p eId="para_5725">The introduction of electronic identification (EID) for sheep was agreed at EU level in late 2003.  At that time, it was agreed to defer the implementation date until January 2008.  The Council revisited this issue in December 2007 when it was agreed that the deadline for the compulsory introduction of EID should be set for 31 December 2009, 6 years after the original decision was taken.  My consistent view has been that the introduction of EID of sheep should only have been introduced on a voluntary basis.  There has, however, been a lack of support from other EU Member States or from the European Commission for a voluntary scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5726">In the discussions in Brussels, a number of measures have been negotiated intended to minimise any inconvenience in its introduction.  In particular, provision has been made to exempt from EID, lambs under 12 months of age and that are intended for slaughter.  This means that the vast majority of Irish sheep will not be affected by the EID requirement.  Primarily only those animals retained for breeding over the coming years would have to be electronically tagged and so the additional costs to farmers in any given year are being kept to a minimum.  It is my intention that the scheme to be introduced during the course of next year will be implemented in consultation with the stakeholders and will take appropriate account of Irish conditions.</p>

All funds generated by leasing of property are allocated directly to the Fishery Harbour Centre (FHC) Fund.  The FHC Fund was established under the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968 and is used for the operation and development of the harbours.  There is an obligation therefore on me to ensure that the property portfolio is used to its maximum potential.</p>

The lease expired on 31st October 2007. On the expiry of the lease a two year licence to occupy the premises was issued on 1st November 2007.  This licence expired on 31st October 2009. A nominal annual rent of £500 / €635 has been charged since 1987 and has not been increased.  A number of conditions were included in the lease agreement.  One of these conditions specified that a building, in accordance with plans and specifications attached to the lease, would be erected on the site.  Another of the conditions states that at the end of the term the leesee will "quietly yield up the demised premises with all buildings erected thereon in a good and tenantable state of repair and condition".</p>
            <p eId="para_5730">My Department is obliged to ensure that it secures the maximum return from its resources as set out in the Public Procurement Guidelines issued by the Department of Finance.  Accordingly, and in line with existing policy, it is a requirement that the site would be valued and a public tender process put in place to award a lease on the site to the most economically advantageous tender that meets the qualifying criteria set out in the request for tender documentation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5731">I am aware of the concerns of the Sea Scouts in this case and following the valuation of the site I propose to discuss the issues with my officials and the Department of Finance with a view to exploring a solution that is agreeable to the Sea Scouts and consistent with the Public Procurement Guidelines.  In the meantime my Department is seeking advice regarding a legal mechanism by which the Sea Scouts might be allowed to continue to use the premises in the short term while a request for tenders is being prepared or until a resolution is reached.</p>

This would be possible under the new Article 186 powers which are expected to be agreed at the Agriculture Council on 19th November.  The proposed additional funding of €280 million must first be agreed at the Council of Finance Ministers, also on November 19th.

Based on Member States declared dairy production in the year 2008/09, Ireland's share of the 280 million would be approximately €10.7 million.  There will be discretion for Member states in the allocation of the funds but the Commission has suggested that they should be distributed on the basis of objective and non discriminatory criteria.  When the Commission proposals are finalised I will consider how the funds will be administered in Ireland.</p>

Stock of credit remained static, indicating that new credits broadly matched repayments.  A follow-on Review covering the period to end September 2009 is currently under way and is expected in the coming weeks.</p>

The power is a wide ranging one and allows for a response adapted to the particular circumstances of different institutions and sectors.  This approach recognises that this is a complex situation and allows for a flexible response to changing credit needs.</p>

         the efforts he is making to increase on the returns that pig farmers are getting for their product; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that prices are continuing to reduce; if he is satisfied that An Bord Bia is making sufficient effort to support the marketing of this product; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5869">A Development Strategy for the pig sector was drawn up by Teagasc following consultations with a broad range of stakeholders.  This document contains a comprehensive summary of the issues facing the Irish pig sector and proposes measures that need to be taken to position it for a successful future.  Compliance with environmental protection legislation, increasing production efficiencies, pig health matters, research and technology transfer were all identified as areas in need of attention.  The objective is an industry that produces meat to the highest standards of quality and safety, that would be internationally competitive, while having due regard for animal health and welfare and environment protection considerations.  A Steering Group has been progressing the various recommendations of the Development Strategy and I expect it will produce an interim report shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_5870">I am aware that producer prices are down considerably on this time last year while prices for the year as a whole will be down over 5%.  By and large the reason for the price situation is due to the economic recession that has exerted downward pressure on all meat prices.  The price experience here is reflected throughout the EU.  One measure that could offer the prospect of supporting prices is the re-introduction of export refunds with a view to boosting sales to non-EU countries.  I have been raising this issue at Council of Ministers meetings in recent months and there is support from some other Member States.  The Commission, however, is resisting the idea but I will continue to work with like-minded colleagues on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_5871">I am satisfied that the Bord Bia marketing initiatives both at home and overseas are instrumental in supporting the pigmeat sector.  We currently export to over 20 international markets and it is my policy and that of the Government to ensure that Irish producers have access to markets worldwide.  My Department will continue to work with Bord Bia, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and the industry to identify and develop other potential markets.</p>

            <p eId="para_5879">Following publication of the Ryan Report, this House passed a unanimous motion on 28th May, 2009 calling on the congregations to commit to making further substantial contributions by way of reparation, in the context of discussions with the State, including to a Trust to be set up and managed by the State for the support of victims and to other education and welfare purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5880">The Taoiseach and relevant Ministers, including myself, met representatives of the religious congregations on 4th and 24th June last.  At the meeting on 4th June, the Taoiseach conveyed the views of the Government and this House, that further substantial contributions are required by way of reparation and that these contributions need to be capable of being assessed by the public for their significance by reference to the full resources available to the congregations and in the context of the costs of well over a billion euro incurred by the State.  At the meeting and subsequently in a press release, the congregations indicated their willingness to make further contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5881">At the subsequent meeting on 24th June, the congregations reported on the progress they had made in compiling reports on their financial positions.  The Taoiseach indicated that the Government would appoint a panel of three independent persons to assess the material submitted by the congregations and report to Government as to the adequacy of these statements as a basis for assessing the resources of the congregations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5882">The appointment of the three person panel by the Government to examine these statements was announced on 28th July. In this announcement, the Government indicated that while the Panel is carrying out its work, it expected that the congregations would be working to produce an offer of a substantial contribution by way of reparation for the suffering of children in residential institutions.  The statement was circulated to the leaders of all the congregations and their attention was specifically drawn to this aspect of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_5883">The Panel has submitted its Report which is under examination prior to being submitted to the Government.  It is intended that the conclusions of the Panel will be made public.</p>
            <p eId="para_5884">The Taoiseach wrote to the congregations in September requesting that the offer be forwarded to me as soon as possible and the Secretary General of my Department wrote to the congregations on 22nd October.  While some responses have been received, the position is that a full set of responses from all the congregations is awaited.</p>
            <p eId="para_5885">On the question of the uses to which the contribution will be put, the House has noted that both in the meetings with former residents and the congregations, support was expressed for the proposal that the use of a further substantial contribution from the congregations should include a form of independent trust to be set up by the State which would be available to support the needs of survivors for general education and welfare purposes.  The Government will consider the matter, in consultation with the representatives of the survivors and the congregations, in the light of the offer from the congregations and the report of the Panel on the adequacy of the financial statements provided by the congregations as a basis for assessing the resources of the congregations.</p>

         his views on extending the sharing of teaching resources to all aspects of the education sector, as is currently done in the vocational education sector, in order that cross-sectoral redeployment of teachers could provide more flexibility when staff shortages arise; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_5887">There are various arrangements in place at primary and post-primary level that facilitate the sharing of posts between schools in areas such as resource teaching posts, home school liaison co-ordinator posts, Guidance Counsellor posts etc.  The sharing of resources is also encouraged through the curricular concession process which enables priority to be given to applications for curriculum concessions where two or more schools come together and make a joint request for some alleviation.  My Department remains open, of course, to considering any proposal from patrons or schools on other types of school clustering arrangements or inter-school co-operation that would result in improving the efficiency or effectiveness of existing levels of resources.  Ensuring we get value for money for the taxpayer is obviously a priority for me.  We are continuing to find efficiencies where possible.  It is incumbent on all of us that given the financial situation we deploy staff and other resources in the most effective way across the education sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_5888">As part of the modernisation agenda for teachers under the Social Partnership Agreement Towards 2016 it was agreed to address the issue of redeployment of surplus teachers.  Discussions on the arrangements that would apply in the case of second level schools commenced under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council in March 2007.  It was initially agreed that the discussions would take place in a sequenced manner and that the first issue to be discussed was the arrangements that would apply in the case of school closures.  Those arrangements were agreed and have been implemented with effect from the end of the 2006/2007 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5889">Discussions have now focused on agreeing arrangements that will apply in the case of teachers that become surplus in situations other than school closure such as changing enrolments or changed course or subject provision at individual school level.  The arrangements when agreed will be implemented in a timely manner in accordance with the provisions of the Towards 2016 Agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_5891">As the Deputy is aware, the school to which he refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding.  The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_5892">The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_5893">I met a delegation from the school earlier this year.  Since then the school authority has applied to have the band rating assigned to their project revised.

            <p eId="para_5894">The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

            <p eId="para_5908">I propose to take Questions Nos. 442, 491 and 492 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5909">The Government allocated €1m in March 2008 from the Dormant Accounts  Educational Disadvantage Programme for a scheme to assist 100 disadvantaged  schools to progress towards achieving Digital Schools Status, this was subsequently increased to €1.6m in December, 2008 in the expectation that the  scheme would be heavily subscribed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5910">The process of identifying the 100 primary schools for participation in the  scheme involved selecting those schools participating in the Primary Urban Band  1 strand of my Department's DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in  Schools) Programme. The selection of schools for inclusion in DEIS was based on an extensive identification process conducted by the Educational Research  Centre on behalf of the Department in 2005 which identified the socio-economic  variables that collectively best predict achievement.  At present some 200  schools are included in the Primary Urban Band 1 strand of DEIS and within that  band there are varying levels of disadvantage ranging from extreme to just  severe.  The 100 schools identified with the highest concentration of disadvantage within that band have been targeted to benefit from this particular scheme and applications were invited from these schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_5911">The school referred to by the Deputy is outside of the first 100 DEIS Urban  Band 1 schools and therefore was not included in the scheme. The possibility of  extending the scheme in the future to other DEIS schools will be considered in  the light of future available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_5912">The decision to limit the grant to the top 100 DEIS band 1 schools was taken on  the basis that the available funds were limited and that dividing the limited overall fund between all DEIS band 1 schools (of which there are presently 200) would so dilute the individual grants as to render them insufficient to achieve their objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_5913">In 2006 the Comptroller and Auditor General reported on educational disadvantage initiatives in the Primary Sector and central to the findings was  the importance of not spreading limited resources too thinly.  The rationale for this decision was in line with these recommendations whereby limited resources are targeted on the schools in most need.  My Department is committed to focussing its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the  most disadvantaged communities.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_5931">A vital element of the DEIS initiative is the commitment to develop and implement an in-depth programme of research and evaluation to inform policy formation and to facilitate a better understanding of the role which  interventions have to play in the achievement of better outcomes for children  targeted by the DEIS action plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_5932">DEIS provides for evaluation which is formative, that is providing feedback on  the operation of the programme, and summative, providing the basis for a judgment regarding the overall worth or value of a particular measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_5933">In this context, my Department has commissioned the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct an independent evaluation of measures in the School Support Programme (SSP) over the period of the DEIS action plan to 2010. This  evaluation will attempt to monitor the implementation of the programme and  assess its impact on students, families, schools, and communities at primary  and post-primary levels. The thrust of the evaluation will be systemic in the sense that it will be designed to inform policy on the role that initiatives like DEIS can play in promoting social inclusion and to identify models of good practice. It also attempts to assess the extent to which schools are making progress in relation to the three year action plans that are currently being implemented by individual schools and school clusters participating in the SSP.</p>
            <p eId="para_5934">A report prepared by the ERC on Educational Disadvantage in Primary Schools in Rural Areas has been already submitted to my Department.  The report represents an analysis of English reading and mathematics achievement in schools in the rural dimension of the DEIS School Support Programme. This is currently under consideration by my Department.  A substantive report on the DEIS evaluation is expected in mid 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5935">An important element of the evaluation process was the setting up of steering  groups consisting of stakeholders at primary and post primary levels to provide  advice and support on the ongoing evaluation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5936">The first stage of the evaluation was the commencement of the monitoring of  change in achievement (test scores at primary level; examination results at  post-primary level) and other pupil outcomes over the period 2006/07 to 2009/10. Initial tests in some 480 selected DEIS primary schools were conducted in May 2007 to establish baseline data against which outcomes of later tests could be compared. Further testing will take place in May 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5937">The second stage of the evaluation involved surveys of participating schools  (primary and post-primary) to assess their progress in relation to targets specified in their action plans.    A School Questionnaire, completed on a number of occasions over the course of the evaluation, will be used in conjunction with other data available to my Department.  The evaluation will also include attitudinal surveys which will examine the views and observations of teachers, pupils and parents as well as other key personnel engaged in delivering supports under DEIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_5938">In addition to the work of the ERC the Inspectorate has been undertaking work  in relation to evaluation of practice and setting out examples of good practice.  The forthcoming publication of Good Practice in Literacy in Numeracy in Disadvantaged Primary Schools is relevant in this regard.  Furthermore, the  inspectorate's evaluations in DEIS schools (Whole School Evaluations, Subject  evaluations, specific evaluation of the effective use of additional supports in  particular DEIS schools etc.) will feed into the overall evaluation of DEIS.</p>

            <p eId="para_5940">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion was launched by Minister for Education and Science in 2005. The Action Plan brings together and builds upon the full range of schemes and programmes already in place in my Department to combat educational disadvantage.

These comprise 679 primary schools (urban and rural) and 202 second-level schools. In total some €808m has been committed to tackling educational disadvantage since DEIS was launched.</p>

The new organisation will also take responsibility for the external quality assurance review of the universities, a function which is currently performed by the Irish Universities Quality Board (IUQB) and the Higher Education Authority (HEA).</p>
            <p eId="para_5995">An Implementation Advisory Group, representative of key stakeholders in the amalgamation process, was formed to advise the Department in relation to the functions of the new organisation. In parallel with these discussions, the Department prepared a Consultation Paper, covering issues such as the proposed functions of the new agency and its governance and reporting arrangements. The Consultation Paper was published on my Department's website in May 2009, and interested parties were invited to submit suggestions to assist in informing the drafting of legislation. The period of consultation concluded on 26 June 2009 and 33 responses were received from stakeholders. The content of these submissions has been considered in developing the legislation required to bring about the amalgamation.  Work is well advanced on the preparation of the General Scheme and I intend to publish the Bill in the Spring of 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5996">I will also appoint an interim board of the new organisation to drive forward the process of amalgamation and bring about a range of practical organisational initiatives that will deliver greater co-operation and sharing of services across the bodies involved prior to amalgamation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5997">FETAC is currently responsible for making awards that were previously made by FÁS, Fáilte Ireland, Teagasc and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, but the delivery of programmes of training is a matter for the  bodies themselves. Awards previously made by FETAC will continue to be made by the new amalgamated agency. There have been no discussions on transferring responsibility for FÁS and the training functions of Fáilte Ireland, Teagasc and Bord Iascaigh Mhara to my Department. However, I am acutely aware of the  need to develop joined-up approaches to education and training and my Officials are actively involved in collaborative efforts with Officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_6001">A number of concerns have arisen in regard to recent research and debate on the Junior Certificate. These include issues of curriculum overload, the time needed to promote active learning approaches, the need for greater emphasis on assessment for learning, practical project and portfolio assessment, and experiential self-directed learning. Public commentary has become increasingly critical of a second level system which is seen by many as driven by rote learning and examination pressures, rather than the promotion of real understanding and skills. An ESRI longitudinal study of 900 students as they moved from primary through second level schooling has found that by third year, students' experience is dominated by an examination which is of diminishing importance. The report indicates that the Junior Certificate examination is overly influenced by written terminal assessment and has a significant negative backwash effect on what is taught and on how students learn. In addition, the level of external assessment in an examination that is no longer high stakes is excessive, and there are concerns that the continued expansion of additional assessment components in the Leaving Certificate cannot realistically be achieved unless there is a corresponding reduction in the volume of externally set and externally marked assessment at junior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_6002">These factors lead to the inevitable conclusion that the current Junior Cycle curriculum and assessment are in need of reconfiguration to reflect the fundamental principles of education and to take account of current best practice internationally.  I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to review international practice in lower secondary education, to examine what should be prioritised within the totality of the junior cycle experience, and to provide advice on the nature and form of assessment which would be most appropriate in the context of what is no longer a high-stakes assessment. In doing so, the issue of overload and time for active learning should be taken particular account of, to see how best these challenges can be dealt with. The junior cycle should provide for a seamless continuum from primary level, extend and deepen students' skill and competencies in a broad and balanced curriculum that includes a range of subjects, and provide a practical orientation that will engage students and enable less academically orientated students to experience success.</p>
            <p eId="para_6003">I have no plans to make changes to the Junior Certificate programme, timetable or examinations in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_6041">I wish to reassure the Deputy that I, along with my colleagues in Government, recognise the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos.  I have emphasised that the Government decided to continue to provide the Block Grant, which was increased this year. It is targeted as a support to individual pupils to enable them to attend Protestant schools.  I have made clear that I am prepared to work with the Protestant fee-charging schools to identify particular problems and issues that may be arising in some of their schools, or in respect of some students in their schools, and to examine how these might be addressed in a manner consistent with the Constitution.  In this regard I have met with Protestant educational representatives.  I have explained that a simple reversal of the measures taken in Budget 2008 applicable to all Protestant fee-charging schools and determined solely on a denominational criterion was not legally possible.  I believe that engagement between my officials and representatives of the Protestant schools is the best way to seek to resolve the issues that are of concern.</p>

            <p eId="para_6051">The school transport scheme, which is operated by Bus Éireann on my Department's behalf, is a major logistical operation that facilitates the transportation of over 125,000 children to primary and post-primary schools each day; it involves about 42 million journeys and over 82 million kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year.  Given the numbers being transported, and the fact that tickets are free for eligible primary school children, it is inevitable that there will be instances where children who have been issued with tickets will then determine their mode  of transport and the pattern of use.  Bus Éireann has informed my Department that every effort is made to monitor the use of school bus tickets.  Where there is evidence that seats are not being used by eligible pupils, Bus Éireann will seek to have these tickets withdrawn.</p>

I should also say that my Department has commenced a Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme which is to be completed before the end of this year. The Steering Committee is looking at the original objectives of the scheme, whether these objectives remain valid today, the extent to which the objectives are being achieved and whether there are possibilities for economies or efficiencies that would improve the value for money of the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_6067">The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_6068">Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department.  In the case of the latter, only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld can the Secretary General of my Department direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_6069">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The NEWB advises parents to apply to more than one school in order to assist in securing a school placement.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>

            <p eId="para_6071">Dance is included in the strands in the Physical Education curriculum in primary and post primary schools. In addition, students may choose Dance as one of the courses available within the Arts component of the Leaving Certificate Applied programme (LCA). The LCA is taken by some 7% of the student cohort and a maximum of 4 credits from a total of 200 credits in the assessment of the LCA is available for the Dance component. The LCA does not provide for direct entry into higher education, but students may progress to Post Leaving Certificate courses and from there to higher education.</p>
            <p eId="para_6072">My Department is faced with an extensive range of competing needs for investment in education, ranging from addressing educational disadvantage, inclusion of pupils with special needs and newcomer students, meeting the demands of a growing population, strengthening the mathematical, science, and technology aspects of provision, enhancing the professional development of teachers, investing in research and development and promoting second chance learning.  Investment in mainstreaming of dance education as an examinable option within the Junior and Leaving Certificate, other than the LCA,  is not a priority at the current time.</p>
            <p eId="para_6073">I am aware of the issues which have been highlighted in regard to reform of the Junior Certificate and I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to review this area. The focus of the review will be on  entirety of the junior cycle experience,  on what is  taught and learned and on the teaching and learning and assessment approaches.  The junior cycle should provide for a seamless continuum from primary level, extend and deepen students' skill and competencies in a broad and balanced curriculum that includes a range of subjects, and provide a practical orientation that will engage students and enable less academically orientated students to experience success.</p>

            <p eId="para_6157">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. The Government took these decisions to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect Education expenditure, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. I fully accept that while these decisions were not of themselves desirable they were necessary in securing the future economic stability of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_6158">The renewed Programme for Government provides for a number of specific measures in the education sector including a commitment to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio for the lifetime of the Government, 500 teaching posts over the next three years, funding for 28 additional psychologist posts, standard capitation grants to schools being maintained and an extra allocation being made available to schools for needs such as book rental schemes and curricular activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_6159">I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues to be a key Government priority. The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all pupils, including those with special educational needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network. Additional teaching and SNA supports will continue to be allocated as necessary by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in line with my Department's policy to support children with special educational needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_6161">The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The number of hours sanctioned is related to the individual child's attendance at school.  In the case in question, based on the record of school attendance supplied, the child is entitled to receive 2 hours per week home tuition.</p>

            <p eId="para_6163">The schools to which the Deputy refers are currently at different stages of the architectural planning process. Designs have been prepared for the school in Ballygarvan and an application for planning permission has been lodged. The further progression of the project is dependent on the receipt of the necessary statutory approvals.  The school in Passage West is at an advanced stage of Architectural planning. An application has been made for planning permission and the Design Team are currently working on providing further information as requested by the Local Authority.  The school in St. Patricks Hill is currently at an early stage of Architectural planning.  Until such time as each of the schools progress to tender stage and a contractor is appointed it will not be possible to indicate when the projects  will be completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_6165">I can confirm that the schools to which the Deputy refers have made applications to my Department for large scale capital funding. The applications have been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and both were assigned a Band 1 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the projects referred to by the Deputy, are now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_6166">The Deputy will be aware that both schools were included in my announcement earlier this year of projects to enter architectural planning.  Brief formulations are being finalised.  The next step will be the appointment of design teams.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including these projects, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the projects at this time.</p>
