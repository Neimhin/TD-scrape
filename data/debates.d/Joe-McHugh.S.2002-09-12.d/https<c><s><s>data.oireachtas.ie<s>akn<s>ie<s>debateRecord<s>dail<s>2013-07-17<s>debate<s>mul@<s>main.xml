        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">I want to talk to the Taoiseach about the management of the social welfare budget and the policy approaches and unacceptable delays which are adding significant burdens to families, particularly those with children. The delays in processing applications for many social welfare payments, including carer's allowance, disability allowance and invalidity pensions, are unacceptable. Initial applications can take up to nine months, with appeals taking a further six to nine months to process. Yesterday, I was informed that it can take three months for an appeal to get from the Department to the appeals office. Why does it take three months for an appeal to transfer from the relevant section to the appeals office?</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> Increasingly, applicants are receiving letters stating that, due to the large increase in the number of appeals, some time will elapse before an appeals officer will be in a position to consider their case. In the case of the carer's allowance, the person being cared for can be dead and buried before the family receives any relief.</p>

          <p eId="para_4">Deputies are experiencing these types of cases daily.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> These delays constitute a cynical attempt to save money. A report by the free legal advice centres has identified that one in five decisions is being overturned in the appeals process. If better decisions were made in the first place, families would not be burdened with inordinate delays.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> A significant assault on single parent families is emanating from the Department of Social Protection. This month alone, 2,500 lone parents will be moved from the one parent family payment to jobseeker's allowance. The difference in the earnings disregard in the two payments will result in a reduction in income of €50 per week for the families in question. Families in these circumstances should not lose €50 or more per week as a result of the reduction in the earning disregard from €110 in respect of the one parent family payment to €60 in respect of jobseeker's allowance. This reduction is in addition to cuts that have been made to the payment. Moreover, 8,000 people will be moved off the one parent family payment because of decisions taken in the previous budget in respect of the age of the youngest child.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">Will the Taoiseach reverse the assault on the incomes of lone parents and take steps, as a matter of urgency, to reduce dramatically the delays in waiting times for social welfare applications?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_9">This year, the bill for social protection expenditure will be more than €20 billion. This money has been voted, is available and is being paid to a wide range of people who draw on the services of the Department of Social Protection. I note that the spending profile set out by the Deputy's party for the Department of Social Protection was €1.5 billion lower than the current figure. Were expenditure to be reduced by this amount, it would affect and impact on many people in different sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> I am aware from applications that come before me, as a Deputy, of the difficulties that arise in this regard. However, I am also aware of the continuous stream of appeals that come when an application is turned down because decisions may be appealed more than once. While it is regrettable that there is a delay in any appeals system, the sheer volume of appeals has resulted in a delay in the final decisions on appeals.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Deputy Martin is aware that supplementary welfare payments have been voted and are available to those who find themselves in a position where a final appeal has not been determined. This means no one is left in limbo and without assistance from the Department of Social Protection. The Deputy is also aware that the core rates have been protected in respect of all social welfare payments. The money is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> The position in so far as lone parents are concerned is that the strategy is to allow flexibility for everybody to play their full part in their lives and the development of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> During a visit to Sligo the other day, I called into the Intreo office to meet staff who are drawn from the Department of Social Protection and the Health Service Executive's community welfare service. As the pioneers of this new structure, Intreo is doing extraordinary work with the live register and different categories of people who draw social welfare payments. It is a very encouraging development and we want to extend the service across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> While I would like to think that appeals that have been lodged could be dealt with more swiftly, the issue is the sheer volume of appeals. This is due to the change from one category to another, which in many cases results in continuing appeals. </p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The social protection budget is in excess of €20 billion or more than €1.5 billion more than budgeted for by the Deputy's party. The money has been voted, allocated and is being paid and every effort is being made by the Minister for Social Protection to streamline the efficiency of payments. I hope the situation in so far as clarity about decisions and the speed with which decisions are made in respect of appeals can also be dealt with in the time ahead. This is a matter of priority for the Government and the Minister for Social Protection.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">The Taoiseach's words will be cold comfort to those who are in this position. People are being left in limbo. The supplementary welfare allowance system is not adequate and does not provide a payment in 70% of cases. The self-employed, for example, are finding it extraordinarily difficult to access the supplementary welfare allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I ask the Taoiseach to stop using phrases such as "I would like to think we could have better times". It is his job and the job of the Minister to ensure the waiting times are shortened-----</p>

          <p eId="para_66">In February the Taoiseach gave a heart felt apology on behalf of the State to the survivors of the Magdalen laundries for the hurt done to them. He rightly told the women that they were blameless and I have no doubt he was moved by their life stories when he met them. For the women, that apology for the time they were incarcerated in a brutal regime overseen by the State was a turning point.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> So too was the Government's announcement of a redress scheme. The Government's decision to make this redress scheme an <i>ex gratia</i> scheme and to ask the women to make no further claim against the State if they access the scheme was in marked contrast to the generous tone of the Taoiseach's apology. This issue of liability is clearly motivating the religious orders' refusal to make a financial contribution to the redress scheme. The issue of liability underpins the Government's own redress scheme and, for example, its refusal to deal with Bethany Home.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> I respectfully say that the Government's record of failure to tackle the elites and to pursue institutions for wrongdoing is shocking and not good enough. The elites, whether in financial institutions or religious institutions, need to be made accountable to the will of the people. It is no accident that the women and girls were mostly poor. Then, as now, it is one law for the poor and one law for the rich. That is the harsh reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> It is not good enough for the Government to express disappointment and to hope these institutions do the right thing. What does the Government intend to do to ensure the religious orders whose institutions benefited from the enslavement of girls and women in their commercial enterprises pay their fair share into the Magdalen laundries redress scheme?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_57">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_70">This has always been a sensitive matter. For more than 60 years nothing was done about this. Government after Government, some including my party, did nothing about this. We have done something about it. The first thing those women wanted when I met them was a sense of righteousness that the State would apologise for what happened. Second, because of their circumstances and their ages, they wanted put in place a system that was non-litigious and non-adversarial, and that would be quick, efficient and deliver a conclusion and solution for the women. To arrive at that, the McAleese report was important, as was the report of Mr. Justice Quirke. The solution is there.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> We cannot do the scheme without the help of the religious orders because they have all the records about who worked, who attended and who lived in the laundries. The scheme was not contingent upon a 50-50 principle or upon a forced contribution from the religious orders. The Government set out to do something about this where nothing had been done for more than 60 years. I would like to think the religious orders would make a contribution. I cannot force them to because the scheme was not designed on that basis. These people do not have time on their side.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> In respect of the redress scheme, 18 religious orders are involved. There has been a €1.5 billion payout. The Minister for Education and Skills is involved in discussions with all those religious orders on the basis of a scheme that was drafted on the principle of a 50-50 contribution. He will bring his memorandum to Government next week or the following week in regard to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> The women told me face to face that time is not on their side. They did not want tribunals and did not want millionaire lawyers emerging from this. They did not want long-term discussions. They wanted a speedy non-litigious effective response and they wanted an apology from the State. That is all in place. We cannot complete this without the religious orders' co-operation in terms of the records, etc. I ask them to reflect on the question of a monetary contribution. I cannot force them to do that. I cannot take away the charitable status as some people have called for. This is an issue they know about themselves.</p>

        <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_58">

          <p eId="para_74">I very much welcomed the Taoiseach's apology and I acknowledge that it came after decades of other governments doing nothing. That is not an issue of contention between us. This is about accountability. I also met the women, and on the day of the Taoiseach's apology one of them sang "The Fields of Athenry" to us in a room in Leinster House. They showed great spirit, tenacity, good humour and fun despite what they had gone through.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> They wanted an apology, but they want accountability and they want compensation. It is not good enough because the Taoiseach has suggested we need the co-operation of the orders. The suggestion is almost that is a <i>quid pro quo</i>. The Government is not powerless in this position. I listened to the Minister for Justice and Equality rejecting different suggestions that have been made. If we want to restore faith in society, politics and the imperative of politics, we need to make these institutions accountable, whatever their background.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">That would be helpful. I believe the issue of liability is at the core of all of this. Let us not dismiss that as an important consideration. I believe the Taoiseach should publish the letters from the religious orders that the Government has received. I call on the Taoiseach to make personal contact with them and to demand that they fulfil their duties to the small number of survivors, who, as the Taoiseach has said, are quite elderly and infirm. However, publishing the letters, being transparent and getting all of this out would be a useful first step.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">These are the results of a process put in place at the request of the Magdalen women. They asked that this matter would be dealt with speedily and effectively, that compensation would be paid and that the process would be non-adversarial, non-litigious and that it would use non-legal routes that could take years. In order to define the work records and attendance records of those who lived and worked in the Magdalen laundries, we need the co-operation of the religious orders and they have given it.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> The Government has made its decision in respect of the extent of the compensation, depending on the numbers involved. We expect that, following the recommendations of Mr. Justice Quirke, the religious orders should consider making a monetary contribution towards the amount.

          <p eId="para_93">No doubt the Taoiseach is familiar with the recent ruling from the European Court of Justice which held that the State is obliged to protect the pension rights of 1,500 Waterford Crystal workers. The case is now back in the High Court to determine what percentage of their pensions the workers are entitled to. Should the legal process run its full course all the way to the Supreme Court, it could take the workers into 2016 or beyond in their quest for justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> Later this afternoon Deputies from all parties will meet a delegation of former Waterford Crystal workers who are coming to the Dáil to protest at the Government's continuing failure to address the implications of the European Court of Justice ruling. Also here today in the Gallery is the general secretary of Unite, Jimmy Kelly, along with some of the former Waterford Crystal workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> It is now four and a half years since Waterford Crystal shut, decimating the lives of hundreds of Waterford families and indeed the economy in Waterford city. As if it was not bad enough that their livelihoods disappeared so quickly, these workers were further kicked into the ground when they were told that their pensions were effectively wiped out. This has caused particular hardship for many ex-Crystal workers who tell me that some of them and their families are living on the brink of poverty. Many of them are reliant on social welfare in spite of the fact that they have paid into pension funds, some for 46 or 47 years. It is outrageous. Further, it is unfortunate and appalling that since the factory shut four years ago, some 20 of these workers have passed away without receiving their pension entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> Each year hundreds of cases are settled out of court in Ireland. Will the Taoiseach instruct the State's defence team to meet the legal and union representatives of workers to seek an agreement ahead of a High Court date? After all, to go through this procedure could represent a considerable cost on Irish taxpayers and it is not beyond the realms of possibility that a common agreement could be reached with the Unite union without incurring costs of perhaps millions to the taxpayers of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">I was in Waterford recently and I met some of the personnel involved. On 25 April last, the European Court of Justice issued its ruling which contained several clarifications regarding the transposition of the EU directive that had been referred by the High Court in July 2011. The European Court of Justice made its findings and rulings.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> I sympathise and empathise with what Deputy Halligan is saying. The downturn in the economy has affected hundreds of thousands of workers. In many cases, including companies such as Waterford Crystal, this has had a devastating impact on those who have paid into pensions over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> Deputy Halligan asked me about meetings and so on. The matter is before the High Court now and I cannot involve myself in a parallel negotiating position. I am sure those who are on top of all the details as this prepares to go back to the High Court are well aware of what might or might not result from those negotiations. However, I do not want to give any false hope. There is no point in my saying that we will set up a meeting with the union when there is a parallel course going through the courts and I imagine Deputy Halligan understands that. If we were to take this outside that forum without the authority to make a decision at the end, it would only cause a lot of trouble and confusion and I am sure Deputy Halligan understands that as well. The process is in train, the ECJ has made its ruling and it has gone back to the High Court. Those arguing the issues now have the clarification they sought from the European Court of Justice and I expect that the process of the High Court can deal with this.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">There is nothing prohibiting reaching a settlement. The barristers and legal teams have said as much and it is under the European directive. There is nothing stopping the Government from speaking to the union and making a settlement outside of court. That has been made quite clear by the legal teams. If the Taoiseach read the European directive he would see that it has almost been acknowledged as the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> Is it not regrettable that the State would choose to contest this when it is an open and shut case causing distress and uncertainty to workers? I have referred to the potential costs to taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> The Taoiseach may be aware that in the United Kingdom all workers are entitled to 90% of their accrued pensions. That ruling was issued by the European courts some years back following a case taken by a worker in the United Kingdom. It is appalling and outrageous that former taoisigh, Ministers and bankers are on huge pensions. One former Minister chose to leave the country and live in another country and have his pension sent out to him. Here, we have workers who have contributed to the Irish economy for up to 47 years with payments to keep the economy going. There were 5,500 workers at one stage. We are going to force those workers, 20 of whom have already passed away, into the High Court and possibly the Supreme Court. There is no sense in doing this when the European Court of Justice has already issued a directive to the effect that these workers are entitled to their pensions.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">This was a landmark case taken by the union to the European Court of Justice. It is necessary that the clarifications given by the European Court of Justice be available to the State. The negotiating team for the State and the team for the workers are involving themselves with the clarifications and are going back into the High Court. The reason these clarifications are necessary is that these rulings have general application for many thousands of other workers. Consequently, it must be uniform across the board in respect of all workers in that sense.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I wish to take this opportunity, on behalf of all Members, to pay a special tribute to Kieran Coughlan, sitting in front of me, who retires as Secretary General and Clerk of Dáil Éireann in the coming weeks after a long and distinguished career of public service to the State. Kieran arrived in Leinster House in 1973 and has served in many roles in the Houses of the Oireachtas. All Members can agree this is a very different place than it was 40 years ago. Having been here for almost that length of time myself, I can discern many of the changes that have occurred through the lifetime of many Governments. For example, there have been changes to and modernisation of the communications systems that apply in terms of politics and the Oireachtas, as well as the introduction of Oireachtas broadcasting. There was a time when the only coverage given was in the newspapers of the day by the distinguished members of the Fourth Estate in the Visitors Gallery, as well as the odd reflection on radio. It has moved a long way with the instantaneous communication people now have.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">Moreover, the setting up of the Oireachtas Commission and the publication of the debates on the web on a daily basis are all positive developments that have enhanced the business of the House to which Kieran Coughlan contributed generally. His role always was broad and included taking on responsibilities in referendum commissions, constituency commissions and the Standards in Public Office Commission. Members of most recent Dáileanna will have seen the Clerk of the Dáil read out the results from the constituencies and their names being enshrined on the record of the Dáil after the election by people throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> I have known Kieran Coughlan for all these years and state publically that through all that time, the outstanding characteristic of this Clerk of the Dáil was his absolute integrity in all his dealings with matters of public life and of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

Consequently, I must state to Kieran, his good wife Denise and his daughters, Becky and Ruth, that I thank him on behalf of the State for the outstanding contribution he has made to the development of political life and work surrounding the Houses of the Oireachtas for many years. I wish him good luck in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">I join the Taoiseach - and I am sure the other party leaders - in paying tribute to the work of Kieran Coughlan as Clerk of the Dáil and his service here in the Oireachtas, as well as to wish him well for his retirement. Kieran Coughlan was probably the first official of Leinster House who I met when I was first elected here in 1989. Kieran was then the Clerk Assistant of the Dáil and of course became Clerk of the Dáil shortly thereafter. I was struck immediately by Kieran's courtesy, help and assistance, which has been maintained throughout these years. It also is fair to state, as the Taoiseach observed, that as Clerk of the Dáil, he has presided over a period of great change. I think of some of the change events that occurred in this Chamber over that time such as, for example, the defeat of an outgoing Taoiseach, the resignation of that Taoiseach and the continuance in office, on a temporary caretaker basis, of a Taoiseach and Government while a new Government was being formed by way of a coalition arrangement. I think also of the change of a Government mid-term without the holding of a general election, which I believe took place for the first time during his tenure. I also think of the establishment of tribunals of inquiry, which were established by the Oireachtas and were required to report here through the Clerk of the Dáil. This sometimes was a rather difficult and challenging role for the Clerk of the Dáil to exercise, particularly in circumstances in which the tribunals of inquiry were investigating the works of some powerful political figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I also think of the development of the committee system, which changed dramatically from what it was when he became Clerk of the Dáil. Back then, the norm was that Committee Stage of pretty well every Bill was taken in the Chamber but now, that is much more the exception. I also, of course, think of the establishment of the Oireachtas Commission, which gave the Houses of the Oireachtas a degree of budgetary independence that had not previously existed, as well as an independence of management.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> As for the televising of the Dáil and the Seanad, I remember serving on a committee that was established when the idea of televising the Dáil was first mooted. All the discussions at that committee pertained to the rules, camera angles, what could be shown and what could not. Times have changed.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">Moreover, the setting up of the Standards in Public Office Commission and the constituency commissions all provided a new role for the Clerk of the Dáil. While one often takes change for granted, change must be managed and the responsibility for the management of the change Members have witnessed over that time was primarily with Kieran as Clerk of the Dáil. I agree with the Taoiseach's comments in respect of paying tribute to his integrity, efficiency, courtesy and above all, his respect for the elected Members of this House. He epitomises public service at its best and I wish him well in his retirement and I wish well to his wife, Denise, and his daughters, Becky and Ruth, for the time ahead.</p>

Is léir go n-oibríonn sé go dian dícheallach ar son gach éinne. Níl aon amhras ach go bhfuil a dhea-thionchar le feiscint ar chúrsaí parlaiminte na Tithe seo le blianta beaga anuas.

          <p eId="para_127">I wish him a happy and long retirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> Undoubtedly, he will be seen as one of the great modernisers and modernising influences in the evolution of our Parliament. He has reached 40 years of service.

          <p eId="para_130">-----and Kieran Coughlan joined the Oireachtas Service and came to Leinster House. I encourage Kieran to write his memoirs because his span of service covers the election of eight different taoisigh. Consider the history involved in all of that alone, and the sense of drama that surrounded it. He has witnessed many general elections and he has served 11 holders of the Office of Ceann Comhairle. It is an extraordinary life span of contribution and service.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> He has been a member of the constituency boundary commissions, so he has an intimate knowledge of every constituency. He, more than most, will have an inside knowledge of how the next general election will pan out, and he will have more time to analyse the different constituencies. He might be able to say that if a boundary had not been put in a certain area, such-and-such a person might have got elected as opposed to the person who is elected. It will be fascinating for him on a personal level given his intimate knowledge of every constituency and every local electoral area. He was also a member of the Referendum Commissions, which were a new and modernising development that emanated from court decisions and so forth. They are very important institutions in setting down markers and guiding us in how we organise and administer referendums now and in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> Kieran Coughlan also played a significant role in helping the Dáil to develop international relationships, particularly with Sir William McKay, the former Clerk of the House of Commons, and Charles Johnson, former Parliamentarian of the US Congress. I also think of his work with the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Tánaiste will agree that it took a long time to develop the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association. It involved a great deal of painstakingly building trust between people from both sides and that was a significant achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> Above all, Kieran has been very diligent. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of the House and particularly of the Standing Orders. The Ceann Comhairle will be the first to testify that all Members of the House are very anxious to comply with Standing Orders and do their level best to do that on an ongoing basis. Kieran's leaving will, perhaps, undermine our capacity to comply as best as we might with the Standing Orders into the future, but we will do our best.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> Kieran was born and raised in Cork, which was a good advantage from the start. Like many Cork men I know, he exudes a very calm demeanour under great pressure. He always had a sense of the big picture in life and this Parliament has been the beneficiary of his wisdom and guidance. I thank him very much.</p>

          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_136">I was not so young when I first became a Member, as I was a long time knocking at the door. There are many younger people than me who made it to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> I arrived alone to the House 16 years ago in 1997. It was a cold place politically. However, as I have said previously about the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, they have all been extremely courteous and helpful in guiding a new Member, particularly somebody who had nobody to relate to from within their party grouping in previous service. For me, Kieran Coughlan stands out as certainly the most accessible, helpful and courteous of all. He is an outstanding administrator, as has been demonstrated to us time and again. He is a public servant of the highest calibre, epitomising the very best that our public service offers on an ongoing basis. That must be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> His skill in addressing, overcoming and, indeed, getting around obstacles if required, has been shown on countless occasions. That is acknowledged by the experience of the greater number of Members who have been here for a number of years. Kieran has always addressed all of the challenges with the clear intent of bringing everything to a resolution and getting to the correct and best place.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> As has already been mentioned, his care, attention, diligence and work with those of us who laboured over recent years to achieve the establishment of the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association is a clear example of the extent of Kieran's commitment to realising what is best not only for the Houses and the people of this State, but also with an eye to the needs of the people of Ireland and the need to work together to address the common challenges that life throws up to all of us irrespective of the part of the island in which we live. While for many the advent of the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association last October might not have been the most seismic development arising from the Good Friday Agreement, for us who have laboured it is a very important milestone and one that in time will prove to be of outstanding worth.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> Finally, replacing Kieran Coughlan, a man of outstanding worth in terms of his service to the Houses and to the people of Ireland, will be a very difficult job. He has been a unique person in my 16 years in the House and on my behalf and on behalf of the team I represent here, I extend a very sincere céad míle maith aige and wish him many years of happy and healthy retirement.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_141">On behalf of the members of the Technical Group, I wish to add my thanks to Kieran Coughlan and good wishes for his retirement after 40 years of service to the Houses, 23 of them in the Dáil. It is an extraordinary service over an extraordinary length of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> Members of the Technical Group probably have more reason than most to be in contact with the Clerk of the Dáil's office. The nature of our group is slightly different from that of the political parties, so we always have some testing questions for the Clerk. It is very important that we feel we can approach the Clerk and know that we will be received with knowledge, trust and integrity, and that is what we have found with Kieran Coughlan. In addition, he has the personal quality of being an incredibly nice and likeable man. That greatly adds to the position. For most of us, he was the first person we formally met on first arriving to Leinster House following success in an election. In my case, it was a by-election, followed by a general election. As Deputy Ó Caoláin said, some of us were knocking on the door for a very long time. It was a great occasion to sign the roll and it is a time each of us will remember in our own way.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> The institutional memory in an office is not just about documenting the various rules and regulations, but also about how they are arrived at and shaped. As has been said, Kieran Coughlan was a moderniser, so it was not only about documenting but also about shaping the changes in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> There have been seven different Taoisigh and a large number of Governments during Kieran Coughlan's time as Clerk of the Dáil. It must be incredibly difficult to consider the qualities his successor will be required to bring to the position. I can just imagine the type of advertisement which might be placed in the media. It will probably refer to the need to have a thick skin, being willing to work long hours and possessing an encyclopaedic knowledge of the workings of the Parliament and an ability to work with a wide range of individuals. The person who succeeds the current Clerk will have to do all this and also be a constitutional officeholder of the highest integrity. He or she will have a big pair of shoes to fill.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> I wish Kieran Coughlan a healthy and happy retirement. I hope it will be a very long retirement.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">The Taoiseach may recall that a recent edition of the "Prime Time" programme contained some shocking revelations in respect of crèche facilities. There has been major concern and anxiety regarding the protection of children as a result of what was shown and questions are being asked as to whether the steps necessary to protect children are being taken. In that context, will the Taoiseach indicate when the Children First Bill will be published? He gave a commitment to the effect that it would be published this week and there were previous commitments to the effect that it would be published this term. I would appreciate it if he would indicate when the Bill will be published. This is an issue of great concern to many people and, in the final two days of this session, I would appreciate clarity as to the timeline relating to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> In the context of the Red Cross (Amendment) Bill, the programme for Government contains a commitment to initiate a detailed legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Red Cross. Will the Taoiseach provide an update on the current status of this legislation?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T11:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_151">The Red Cross (Amendment) Bill is scheduled to be published next year. As the Deputy will be aware, the purpose of the Children First Bill is to implement the programme for Government commitment relating to Children First. On 24 April 2012, the Government gave its approval in respect of publication and referral of the draft general scheme and heads of the Bill for consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. The committee engaged in a wide-ranging process of consultation with organisations and individuals that work with children and provided an extensive report on 5 July 2012. By its nature, the legislation is both complex and difficult and significant policy, operational and legal issues have emerged on foot of the views expressed by the Oireachtas committee and the Department's further consideration of the draft general scheme and heads of the Bill. It is expected that the revised version of the latter will be sent to the Attorney General's office for its consideration shortly, with a view to the Minister receiving Government approval to commence drafting the legislation as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> I had thought it might be possible to publish the Children First Bill this session. However, the range of views expressed by the Oireachtas committee as part of its comprehensive analysis of the heads of the Bill was far more extensive than people might have imagined. As already stated, the draft general scheme and heads of the Bill are being referred to the Attorney General's office for consideration and approval for drafting and publication of the legislation should then follow. I apologise for the fact that we are behind in terms of the timeline but, as indicated, this is as a result of the very broad range of important views expressed by the members of the Oireachtas committee. I will keep Deputy Martin updated on the position when the Attorney General gives her approval for the Government to proceed with drafting.</p>

On the Government's commitment to legislate for the right of workers to engage in collective bargaining in order that we might be in compliance with the recent judgment handed down by the European Court of Human Rights, will the Taoiseach indicate both the status of the relevant Bill and when he expects it to be published?</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> The Government gave a clear commitment that it would provide free GP care for all citizens, commencing with claimants of free drugs under the long-term illness scheme, during its first year in office. Obviously, that deadline was missed. It appears that the commitment to which I refer was formally dropped in May. Will the Taoiseach provide an update on the progress that has been made on the Government's commitment to provide free GP care?</p>

          <p eId="para_155">The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White, has done extensive work in respect of this issue. He informed me yesterday that he expects to bring his proposals before the Cabinet sub-committee in the next week or two. I will keep the Deputy informed of the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> On the question of collective bargaining, I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation when he spoke at the 102nd International Labour Conference in Geneva. He said: "It has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining through the development of an institutional framework supportive of voluntary system of industrial relations". In the context of the programme for Government commitment, the Minister has written to all social dialogue participants in terms of reviewing collective bargaining against the backdrop of industrial relations legislation. Submissions have been received and discussions have been taking place between stakeholders' representatives and Department officials. The Minister expects to be in a position to conclude that consultation process shortly and to report to Government in the autumn on the outcome of that process and what proposals to improve the volunteerist system of industrial relations might be brought forward in 2013. He went on to say that he is happy that satisfactory arrangements can be put in place that will reconcile Ireland's constitutional, social and economic traditions and international obligations while at the same time ensuring the success in building Ireland's domestic jobs-base and in continuing to attract overseas investment into the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_157">The bail laws in this country are based on court decisions and legislation from the 1960s and are clearly incapable of dealing with the threat of modern crime. The bail Bill has been promised for some considerable time. I ask the Taoiseach if it might be possible, clearly not in this session, but as a matter of urgency in the next session to bring it forward to facilitate dealing with serious modern crime as it presents today.</p>

There is another world outside this bubble of the Oireachtas, as the Ceann Comhairle well knows. I look forward to Kieran serving the nation in future years in other roles. I thank him again.</p>

On the media and mergers provision, the Parliamentary Counsel raised a series of detailed questions on 25 June. These are being considered by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. While the Bill is at a very advanced stage, publication will not happen before the Dáil rises for the summer recess and that is because of the very detailed nature of the questions which came back.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_243">I thank the Deputies opposite for their support for this important Bill, which will effect the first major constitutional change to the structure of our courts system since 1937. If it is accepted by the people in the referendum, this proposal will improve our system of justice. It will ensure that appeals which are made after cases are determined, particularly in our High Court, can be dealt with more speedily.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">It will ensure that should a referendum be successful, our Supreme Court will be able in the future to focus on cases of general public importance or cases where there are specific reasons in the interest of justices why an appeal should be taken by that court and determine such appeals. There will be many appeals that can be dealt with in the new proposed court of appeal that will not need the engagement of the Supreme Court. The creation of this new court will remove many of the pressures on the highest court of the land. We now have a substantial number of members of the High Court, far more than would have been the case when I began legal practice as a lawyer. </p>
          <p eId="para_245"> The reality is that our appellate court system has not kept pace with the demands of the 21st century. We owe it to our citizens to have the best possible court system available so that those who must resort to litigation as individual citizens are assured that if they must appeal decisions, appeals can be dealt with within a reasonable period of time. It is important that those involved in business and the commercial sector know that if there are issues in dispute that are important to their business, they can be resolved within a reasonable period of time. At a time when we are committed to increasing employment in this State and tackling some of the difficulties we have experienced in recent years, it is of vital importance that foreign businessmen and women, international companies and multinationals know that if they locate in Ireland, we have the best court system in the world. We have an independent Judiciary which serves this State well. We are modernising and updating the jurisdiction of our courts in the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013, with which we will deal shortly. This very important reform will put in place a new court of appeal. </p>
          <p eId="para_246"> I very much appreciate the wholehearted support Deputies have given this Bill. It is of the greatest importance that as we move forward to holding a referendum, our citizens voting in it understand the importance of modernising our courts structure to the State and each and every citizen in the State. This new structural change is of relevance and benefit to every citizen in the State. Regardless of our circumstances, there is always the possibility that something will occur in our lives that leaves us with no choice but to use our courts system to achieve justice. It is important that justice is administered within a reasonable period of time. As the old saying goes, "justice delayed is justice denied". It is also important that we move away from a situation where the Supreme Court has a backlog of cases which it is estimated may take four years to complete without a further appeal being lodged. That is unfair to the judges in that court and to those who await the hearing of appeals. </p>
          <p eId="para_247"> This proposal will facilitate and put in place mechanisms that will enable at the decision of the Supreme Court some pending appeals to be dealt within the court of appeal. It is very important that this decision is made by an independent Judiciary rather than politicians in any sense of the term. We have created a constitutional architecture which, if accepted by the people, will facilitate that. Not only will it ensure that the delays that currently exist are not repeated in the future, it should provide a mechanism to address some of the existing backlog in a manner determined appropriate by our existing Supreme Court. I urge people to vote "Yes" in this referendum when it is held based on it being in all our interests that we have the best courts system in the world that can administer justice within a reasonable period of time and in a considered manner. </p>
          <p eId="para_248"> I hope that when a referendum is being held, all those represented in the House, be they members of political parties or none, will be supportive of this referendum and urge people to vote "Yes". I am very conscious that this could be perceived outside the House as something of a technical issue that is remote from their daily lives. I hope they would see their opportunity to vote on this as an opportunity to contribute to modernising our State and doing something positive with regard to the very important modernising and reform agenda we are applying to our courts system and the Courts Service. I hope we will have overwhelming support from those who vote in the referendum. I will conclude by saying that if that outcome is achieved, I look forward to bringing to the House at the earliest possible opportunity the court's establishment Bill that will be required so that this new court can be established. I confirmed to Members of the House on Second Stage that should the referendum we intend to hold in early October be successful, we envisage that between the enactment of the establishment Bill and the preparations that would be necessary for the court of appeal to be put in place, we will have our new court of appeal at the very latest by the autumn of 2014, which is the start of the law term. This new court of appeal will embrace within two divisions - effectively, a court of civil appeal and a court of criminal appeal. Having a permanent court of criminal appeal will also have the benefit of ensuring that where prosecutions have been taken, those who are found guilty can have their appeals processed more quickly than may be the case at present and appeals against leniency of sentence brought by the DPP in circumstances where someone has been convicted can be processed more quickly. There is a range of advantages to the public that this reform effects. I thank Members of the House for their support for the Bill and the steps we are taking.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to make a few concluding remarks. I reiterate that I and my party support the Bill and the referendum and will be encouraging people to support it. I agree with the Minister that the public should not view this as a technical piece of legislation because it will impact on people every single day of the week. I said in my contribution on Second Stage that justice delayed is justice denied - a belief we all subscribe to. Hopefully, this will feed into a reform of the courts system which will deliver speedier processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> I warned, as did others, that we must look at the systems within our Courts Service in terms of resourcing. It is an issue every day of the week and we are all aware of it. We hear anecdotally of cases which do not commence when they are scheduled to for very fairly basic reasons such as members of An Garda Síochána not being able to turn up because they are not rostered to turn up and court support staff like stenographers not being available. There is a significant amount of resourcing that must be looked at and that is something we must keep in the back of our minds. Putting the structural reforms on the Statute Book is obviously step one in the process, but it must feed down into the day-to-day management and operation of the courts. From our perspective, we welcome anything that will give court users greater service and satisfaction derived from getting a timelier service. I am glad to put that on the record again.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_252">Sinn Féin supports the Bill and will support a "Yes" vote in the referendum. When one considers the pressures on the Supreme Court at present the Bill is necessary. A total of 605 cases were appealed to the Supreme Court last year, which is a 21% increase on the year before. It issued judgments in 121 cases compared to 64 judgments issued by the US Supreme Court and 85 judgments issued by the supreme court in London. When one considers the respective population sizes this is not sustainable and must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> We know from international best practice that if the Supreme Court is clogged up with appeals it is not able to focus on one of its most important functions, which is being a check on the Executive, examining the constitutionality of legislation, interpreting the Constitution and fulfilling its crucial independent role in our State and democracy. I hope this will free up the Supreme Court. There will be ten judges, which we also welcome, who will be led by the Chief Justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> Arguably this is a very exciting development in terms of the potential of the Supreme Court to move to the next level but there is a little concern. I appreciate when we have discussions about judicial appointments that the Minister is rightly determined to defend the integrity of the Judiciary and to demonstrate it is independent. As I have stated previously, the eight Supreme Court judges are people of impeccable qualification and capacity, and arguably the most talented group we have had in the history of the State. Earlier today when discussing the Legal Services Regulation Bill a point was made with regard to perception, and there is a perception that political appointments are not truly independent. Particularly in terms of the Supreme Court we need to see judges who are really independent of thought and have no fear whatsoever of challenging the Government and holding it to account, and clarifying matters of legal importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> I read an interesting article earlier this week which expressed concern. The bulk, if not all, appointments to the Supreme Court are from the High Court and therefore we can see their track record in terms of challenging the Government, and now we have freed up the Supreme Court to have this badly needed space to fulfil one of its primary roles and to begin to be more creative and imaginative in terms of challenging the Government we also need to ensure a good balance in how it is made up. Irish society comprises people who are liberal and conservative and come from various backgrounds. We need a Judiciary, particularly at Supreme Court level, which is representative of the various perspectives in Irish society in terms of the decisions it makes.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> We will continue to debate this issue. I know the Minister is examining judicial appointments and I hope before the end of term to see legislation, which will have to be brought by the Minister, which will ensure judicial appointments are entirely independent of the Government. There is no question whatsoever about the independence of the Judiciary and it can fulfil its very critical role in our democracy.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_281">In page 9, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_282">“(b) Subject to paragraph (b), no more than one bona fide representative of the Press shall attend proceedings to which the relevant enactment relates.</p>

          <p eId="para_285"> Amendment No. 1 reflects the concern expressed by the Ombudsman for Children. She outlined the concern that one might have a number of bona fide representatives of the media present at a family court hearing and although all media representatives would aim to comply with the requirements, the combination of the separate reportage of the case might serve to identify the parties to the court hearing. The amendment proposes that there would be just one bona fide representative of the press at any family court hearing.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">I think we have resolved the confusion at this stage. On Second Stage in this House last week, I explained that the provisions in Part 2 provide for a careful balancing of the need for privacy in child care and family law proceedings with the need for public access to important information on the operation of this very sensitive and difficult area of law. In that respect, Part 2 will retain protections for the privacy of the parties, including the privacy of any child to whom the proceedings relate, in respect of such court proceedings while providing that bona fide members of the press can be admitted to the proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> Amendment No. 1 provides for restrictions on the number of press members who can attend such proceedings. I agree it is important that the courts can impose appropriate restrictions on press attendance where it is necessary to do so. The power to do so is already provided for in the Bill. I refer the Deputy in particular to sections 5 and 8. These sections provide the court with a power to exclude or restrict the attendance of bona fide members of the press at family law and child care proceedings, in particular where it is necessary to do so to preserve the anonymity of a party to the proceedings or any child to whom the proceedings relate. Indeed, the provisions go even further and give the court the power to prohibit or restrict the publication or broadcasting of any evidence given or referred to during such proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> It is important to understand that my proposals in this Bill have been carefully drafted to ensure that the courts, in deciding on the issue of press access or publication of evidence, must have regard to the privacy rights of persons, including children, involved in any individual case. I believe that the approach in the Bill provides the right balance to ensure that information is made available to the public on the operation of family law and child care law in our courts while at the same time safeguarding the important privacy needs of the parties and of any children to whom the proceedings relate.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> In amendment No. 2 the Deputy is proposing a system of accreditation for the attendance of members of the press at family law and child care proceedings. The Bill does not propose to regulate the members of the media who may or may not be permitted access to relevant child care, family law and adoption proceedings. The Bill leaves it to the court to allow bona fide members of the media to be present in certain circumstances. It is a matter for the individual court to be satisfied as to the bona fide nature of a press representative in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> The same approach is used in many legislative provisions, including those relating to criminal proceedings in serious sexual offence cases. Those legislative provisions also use the term “bona fide representatives of the Press”. The experience to date is that the approach works well and I am happy it is the correct approach in the circumstances of these provisions also.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">It is consistent with the existing legislation applicable to other areas of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> As I said on Second Stage, I agree with the Deputy that we must have very careful rules with regard to publishing material about family law and child care cases. It would be very useful if, following enactment of the legislation, there could be some agreed protocol with media outlets as to how they would report family cases to ensure there was a degree of consistency in the non-disclosure of sensitive information or any other information that could result in individuals being identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> My view is that the concerns of the Deputy are indeed valid, but the amendments he proposes are not appropriate. The concerns are, I believe, fully and properly provided for in the very carefully drafted provisions of Part 2. I do not, therefore, propose to accept these amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">In general, court reporting is of a high standard, although I would be interested in the Minister's opinion in this regard. Obviously, there have been a number of high-profile transgressions and issues, but the majority of court reporting is factual concerning the evidence and findings and, as such, cannot be disputed.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> The Minister referred to maintaining the protection of privacy for people involved in the family law courts. While we all ascribe to this suggestion, are we in danger under this legislation of moving away from a general prohibition on naming those involved? Will the Minister elaborate in this regard? The custom is a general prohibition on naming parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> The Minister stated that it would be for the court to decide on the bona fides of the press members who were allowed to report. What is the definition of a "bona fide representative"? Does it mean a member of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, or a local, well known stringer who attends the courts and is known to the local Judiciary?</p>

          <p eId="para_297">It is absolutely clear that the anonymity of individuals who are engaged in family law litigation, be it adoption, marital breakdown, civil partnership issues or issues relating to children, has to continue to be preserved. That remains part of our law. The provisions that will allow for members of the press to attend are designed and intended to ensure that individuals' anonymity is preserved, not just in the context of names not being published, but also in that any information that could result in individuals being identified cannot be published. That is clearly set out in the context of the provisions contained in the Bill and in the connectivity between this Bill and original provisions in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> The "bona fide representatives of the Press" term is a term that is used in different legislative Acts. In the context of reporting serious sexual offences, for example, rape offences, reporters can and have been able to attend court. They are required to comply with anonymity provisions. I do not believe that there is a need to define further what is meant by "bona fide representatives of the Press". It does not have to be that an individual is a member of the NUJ if he or she is a press reporter. In practice to date, this has not given rise to difficulty in any other area of the law. There is no reason it should bring some additional difficulty in this area of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> I expect that the way this will work ultimately in practice will largely reflect the way that court reporting currently works, where there is an identified group of reporters who generally attend at our courts, be they local Circuit or District courts throughout the country or the High Court or Supreme Court, to report cases. Of course, people come and go. New members of the press take up that sort of reportage and others may move on to other areas of work, but they can readily identify themselves to court registrars. This has worked informally extremely well for many years and has not given rise to any difficulty. The judges dealing with family law cases will be familiar with dealing with members of the press in other areas in which they have worked and I do not envisage any particular difficulty arising.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> Clearly, if a family law case was to be heard and if the judge had any doubt about an individual who was sitting in court as to whether he or she was a bona fide member of the press or if the parties to the court case or their lawyers had concerns if, for example, someone turned up sitting at the back of the court who happened to be a next door neighbour and claimed to be a bona fide member of the press, I do not think that it requires much ingenuity or imagination as to how a court or a judge would approach that issue. I think that this is a practical, common sense measure using a description with which we are all already familiar.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">No, it is the decision of the court. I refer the Deputy to section 5. There are various provisions in it. The new subsection (3A)(<i>b</i>) reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_305">Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d), where, in proceedings under a relevant enactment, a court is satisfied that it is necessary to do so--</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_306">(i) in order to preserve the anonymity of a party to the proceedings or any child to whom the proceedings relate,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_307">(ii) by reason of the nature or circumstances of the case, or</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_308">(iii) as it is otherwise necessary in the interests of justice,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_309">the court may, on its own motion, or on application to it by a party to the proceedings or by a person on behalf of a child to whom the proceedings relate, by order--</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_310">(I) exclude, or otherwise restrict the attendance of, bona fide representatives of the Press from the court during the hearing or particular parts of it, or</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_311">(II) prohibit or restrict the publication or broadcasting of any evidence given or referred to during the proceedings or any part of such evidence,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_312">and any such order may, with regard to any restriction, contain such conditions as the court considers appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Remember that the position remains that the public is not admitted to family court proceedings. The only persons who could be present in a court other than the parties, their lawyers and perhaps a witness who is called to give evidence would be the court officials and the judge. If someone else is in the back or front of the court looking as if he or she is taking notes, a member of the public is not allowed and if that person is there under the continuing law, he or she could be excluded. If he or she is a bona fide member of the press and there are still concerns by application of the factors that I just mentioned, it is open to the judge on his or her own initiative or to legal representatives or, indeed, the parties to the proceedings to draw their concerns to the attention of the judge. The judge would be able to exclude an individual.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">I did not get a chance to speak to the second amendment directly. The Minister will appreciate that we support the objective of the Bill. One of the initial objectives was to ensure accountability in judgments in family law courts and to have a reporting system to ensure same. The Minister has tried to provide a counterbalance in the Bill of protecting the privacy of the parties, in particular where children are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> There is more work to do on the "bona fide" issue. It is too much to ask the parties in the court and their legal representatives to ascertain the position. I have not tabled an amendment on local media, but I am concerned about the issue. The Minister is aware that the media are present in the District and Circuit courts and family courts are held in the Circuit Court. The journalists represent a newspaper and according to the Bill are bona fide. If they report different aspects of a case in a local newspaper, it does not take much of a stretch of the imagination for people to work out basic details and identify people even when the parties are not named. In a city, one might not be aware of a divorce or separation across the street, but in rural areas one is, particularly where children are involved and families are in dispute. In the case of large, extended families, narratives could be put out by either side. Sadly, that occurs all too often.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">If we do not have a fairly tight restriction with one bona fide representative and with these checks and balances in place, I am concerned that we would be on dangerous ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> We also discussed the issue of contemporaneous reporting. A reporter could go online or on radio to report a case that, unfortunately, somehow manages to identify families. People may even wrongly assume which family is involved, in which case children could face teasing or other difficulties. I appeal, therefore, for more caution concerning the bona fide representatives. I appreciate that the Bill gives a judge a fair degree of discretion, but I am not sure if it is tight enough around these issues. I ask the Minister to consider the matter further.</p>

I know the Minister has engaged with this proposal in the Seanad, but I have resubmitted it for further engagement on this Stage, as I support what Senator van Turnhout is trying to achieve.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_349">When this important issue was raised in the Seanad, I lent my support to the view that this matter should be dealt with as speedily as possible. I pointed out, however, that the issue is complex and requires careful consideration to ensure any proposal in this regard correctly balances the constitutional right of the accused to due process with the privacy rights of the complainant. The Attorney General has advised me that a detailed examination is required to identify and provide precisely for the rights concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> It is intended to complete passage of the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill before the House rises for the summer recess. I have decided that in such circumstances, there is not enough time to address this issue comprehensively with the careful consideration required in the timeframe available. I have come to this conclusion because I believe that further consultation is necessary with interested parties to bring forward a robust and workable solution. In particular, I want to allow time for full consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions to ensure any proposal put forward will work in practice to protect the rights concerned, ensure the effectiveness of the prosecution process and, in the future, not jeopardise in any way the efficacy of prosecutions taken. I am also concerned that any proposal in this regard should be comprehensive and should address the rights of adult as well as child complainants. It could create a particular anomaly if it were confined to children alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> The examination and consultation on this subject proposed by the Law Reform Commission would be a suitable way of examining such a complex issue. However, I am conscious that the timeframe for such an examination is not appropriate and that more immediate action is required. I have therefore decided that this issue will be addressed in the forthcoming sexual offences Bill, which is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department. I believe this is the correct approach to ensure a suitable legislative solution is found as soon as possible to resolve this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> I hope the House will understand that I cannot accept this amendment, not because I reject its purpose or value but because this subject demands a fuller and very careful examination than is possible in the context of an amendment to this Bill. I am particularly concerned that it is confined to children and does not extend to adults. The same area of difficulty can also arise in respect of adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> In addition to the reasons I have just given, there are a number of difficulties with the actual drafting of the amendment. For example, the proposed section states where a person under the age of 18 gives evidence as a witness in any criminal proceedings, evidence disclosing the content of communications made by the witness in confidence in the course of sexual assault counselling should not be admissible save by order of the court. The section is based on an assumption that the person who is the victim will either already have given evidence or be in the course of giving evidence, because it mentions a person who gives evidence and does not refer to the victim or the alleged victim. There is no provision for pre-trial procedures. It would be very unsatisfactory in the context of a criminal trial that this issue would only be addressed during the course of someone giving evidence, except in exceptional circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> If there were to be an issue as to whether this type of report would be disclosed, it would preferably be dealt with in a pre-trial procedure, whereby the case is made in a pre-trial application as to why it should be disclosed and why it should not be disclosed. It may well be that in determining whether it should or should not be disclosed, a judge would have access on a preliminary basis to the documentation concerned and would himself or herself determine its relevance, or not, to any issues in dispute, or likely to be in dispute, in the criminal proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> The manner in which this amendment is framed could create a very real problem and could result in a trial being unnecessarily prolonged or adjourned, to the detriment of the victim who, having gone through the trauma of attending court, could find the hearing is adjourned for a period of days or weeks while an issue is addressed in this context. This is a problem not only of a merely technical nature, but of a substantive nature as to how it could effectively impact on trials.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> With regard to the provision in the proposed new section, there would have to be clarity as to the persons with whom communications should be regarded as confidential. In the context of this particular provision, reference is made to a person who has undertaken training or study. This does not mean the person is actually qualified, for example, to provide counselling to an individual - be they a child or an adult who has been the victim of a sexual assault. What if someone begins training or study, but does not obtain a professional qualification? Does this make the person an individual with whom one can have a privileged conversation? This raises a very important issue. It also refers to a person who has experience which is relevant to the process of counselling persons. This wording is extremely wide and therefore it is not clear what it means.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">A conversation between the victim of an alleged sexual assault in the hours following that alleged assault with any person claiming to know something about the process of counselling could suddenly become a privileged conversation. The nature of the conversation which the victim had, the victim's appearance, conduct and substantive detail of what he or she said to that individual in the immediate aftermath of the alleged assault, particularly where the individual was not someone engaged in counselling, could be of specific relevance in determining the credibility of an allegation made and determination of whether an individual charged was innocent or guilty.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> While there are problems with the drafting of the amendment, it is a well-intended provision. There is a real problem in this area in terms of attempts to trawl, in the context of criminal trials, notes of counsellors which are of no real relevance to the outcome of the hearing. I am anxious to ensure victims of sexual assault who need support and counselling do not fear that if they reveal confidential information about their lives to a counsellor that is of no relevance in real terms to the allegation made or determination of guilt or innocence. that information will be unnecessarily put into the public domain, causing them additional stress. This is a real issue which we need to address. However, it must be addressed carefully. Also, in addressing it we should not discriminate between children and adults, although children can be particularly vulnerable. The sad and tragic reality is that sexual assault or rape is a sensitive matter and what occurs is very traumatic for the individual. We must approach these matters with particular care.</p>

          <p eId="para_367"><b>
						</b>Amendment No. 5 is a technical amendment which provides for improvements to the text of section 8 of the Bankruptcy Act 1988. The first change is in regard to the prescription of certain notices that may be issued by a creditor. The change is required in the context of the preparation of draft rules of the superior courts to facilitate the amendments to the Bankruptcy Act effected by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. Failure to classify the required notice under section 8(1) as a prescribed document may call into question the power of the rules committee to specify a form for same, as it is a pre-proceedings document.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> The second change aligns the required notice period in the old section 8 of the 1988 Act, which required only a four day notice to the debtor, with the new 14 day notice period in the revised subsection (1)(c) inserted by the 2012 Act as a precondition of a creditor being granted a bankruptcy summons.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"><b>
						</b>Amendment No. 6 is a drafting amendment to correct an error in the text of new section 60A(2) made in the Seanad in regard to the transfer of staff from the Courts Service to the Insolvency Service of Ireland. The correct reference in subsection (2) should be to the whole of the section and not just to subsection (2).</p>
          <p eId="para_370"><b>
						</b>Amendment No. 7 is a technical amendment to improve the text of section 60A(5)(<i>c</i>) by including a specific reference to the superannuation benefits of the staff concerned who may transfer from the Courts Service to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"><b>
						</b>Amendment No. 8 proposes a new subsection (2A) in section 85B of the Bankruptcy Act 1988, which was inserted by section 157 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, which concerns the entitlement to discharge from bankruptcy. The new subsection provides that an order of discharge from bankruptcy shall provide that any property of the bankrupt then vested in the official assignee shall be returned to the bankrupt. This provision was inadvertently omitted from the 2012 Act. Of course, this would only arise when all the necessary conditions of the bankruptcy, including satisfaction to the fullest extent possible of the claims of the creditors, had been made. This would permit any surplus which remained to be returned to the former bankrupt.</p>

						</b>Amendment No. 29 is also a technical drafting amendment recommended by the Office of the Attorney General to make it clear that an appeal against a decision of the Circuit Court under the Personal Insolvency Act shall lie to the High Court sitting in Dublin, with the exception of the situation under section 169(4) of that Act, which relates to appeals to the Circuit Court against certain decisions of the Insolvency Service of Ireland regarding the regulation of personal insolvency practitioners. This technical amendment will allow any such appeals to be heard in Dublin by a judge nominated by the President of the High Court for that purpose, which is desirable given the specialised nature of the legislation and the need to ensure that appeals can be dealt with in a timely manner. This is already the case for most appeals which will, as far as possible, be heard and disposed of on affidavit and this proposed amendment extends this to any case in which a hearing may be conducted on oral evidence. Without amendment of the 1936 Act, appeals from determinations of the Circuit Court made on oral evidence would in the ordinary course be held before the High Court on Circuit sitting in the appeal town designated for the appeal, which could give rise to delays in dealing with appeals. We are anxious to ensure no such delays occur.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_403">In page 35, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_404">
            <b>"Amendment of section 9 of Act of 2012</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_405"><b>42. </b>Section 9(1) of the Act of 2012 is amended by the substitution of the following for paragraph (g):</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_406">"(g) in accordance with section 47—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_407">(i) authorise a person or class of persons to perform the functions of an approved intermediary,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_408">(ii) supervise and regulate persons or classes of persons authorised to perform the functions of an approved intermediary,".".</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Amendments Nos. 10 and 16 deal with approved intermediaries who will process debtor applications for debt relief notices. Amendment No. 10 provides for an amendment to section 9(1)(g) of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 designed to address concerns that the powers of the Insolvency Service of Ireland may not be sufficiently developed in the existing provisions in regard to the ongoing supervision of approved intermediaries. The original provision effectively concentrated on the initial authorisation process only. The amendment makes it clear that the Insolvency Service of Ireland is also concerned with ongoing supervision of approved intermediaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Amendment No. 16 proposes amendments to section 47 in regard to the regulation of approved intermediaries. The current subsection (5) of section 47 is replaced with a new subsection to provide more coherently for the authorisation of approved intermediaries by the insolvency service. The new provisions extend beyond permitting the service to make regulations in relation to the criteria for authorisation of persons as approved intermediaries. There are now more extensive requirements in regard to qualifications of approved intermediaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> The recasting of subsection (5) will also permit the insolvency service to make regulations, not only for authorisation but also for the supervision and regulation of approved intermediaries. This power will ensure that debtors and creditors and the integrity of the approved intermediary are protected through an effective continuing regulatory framework. The setting out of various requirements on the approved intermediary is intended to give the insolvency service more flexibility than seeking to prescribe standards or procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> The proposed new subsection (5A) is designed to ensure the insolvency service can monitor compliance with any regulations made pursuant to this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> The second amendment to section 47 is essentially a drafting amendment to improve the text of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 by relocating the current provisions of subsections (9) to (12), inclusive, of section 27 in regard to circumstances where the approved intermediary can no longer perform that function to section 47, in subsections (8) to (11), inclusive, where they would seem to be more appropriately located.</p>

The information that may be publicly inspected in the relevant registers concerning the various debt resolution processes is removed three months after the completion of those processes. However, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 does not permit repeat applications for each process. Thus, the insolvency service must be in a position to detect such applications. This new provision will remove any doubt that they have the power to retain the relevant debtor information for that purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">This amendment makes two changes to section 27 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 which deals with the initiation of a debt relief notice process by a debtor. A new subsection (4) extends the provisions of the existing text of that subsection by now adding that where the debtor has provided information in regard to his or her application for a debt relief notice, he or she must also give written consent to the making by the approved intermediary of an inquiry under subsection (9), and to the disclosure by the approved intermediary of personal data of the debtor to the extent necessary for such an inquiry. Such inquires would be made to creditors or perhaps to a relevant State authority such as the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> New subsections (9) and (10) replace the previous subsections (9) to (12) in section 27. These latter subsections were relocated to section 47 by amendment No. 16 which we discussed. They provide an explicit power to the approved intermediary to verify the value of a debt or other liability of the debtor with the creditor concerned in regard to the application for a debt relief notice. The creditor is required to respond to the request for information from the approved intermediary within 21 days. Otherwise, the approved intermediary is entitled to presume that the amount of the debt owed is that claimed by the debtor.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> A period of 21 days is not unreasonable and is similar to that required say of the Revenue Commissioners or Department of Social Protection in regard to a request for the inclusion of certain debts in the new debt resolution process.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">I move amendment No. 14:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_453">In page 35, after line 33, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_454">
            <b>“Amendment of section 31 of Act of 2012</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_455"><b>46. </b>Section 31 of the Act of 2012 is amended—</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_456">(a) in subsection (1), by substituting the following for paragraph (a)(ii):</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_457">“(ii) furnish that certificate together with a copy of the application and the supporting documentation (other than the documents referred to in section 29(2)(e) and (f)) to the appropriate court, and”, </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_458">and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_459">(b) by deleting subsection (4).”.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The first part of amendment No. 14 concerns an amendment to section 31 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 in respect of the debt relief notice. The insolvency service, when making the application for a debt relief notice, must furnish to the appropriate court the supporting documentation which has been received by it from the approved intermediary. That requirement is now refined to not require the inclusion of the documents referred to in section 29(2)(<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) which relate essentially to the debtor's consent to the processing of his or her documents and the making of inquiries to verify information by the insolvency service. The amendment is supported by both the Courts Service and the insolvency service, particularly from a capacity and information technology perspective, to ensure the efficient and smooth transfer of documents to the appropriate court.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> The remaining part of amendment No. 14 and amendments Nos. 19, 20, 23 and 24 have the same intention, namely, to delete the similar subsection (4) in sections 31, 61, 95, 78 and 115 of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. That subsection provides that a court may hear additional evidence or information in a hearing of an application under an insolvency process, otherwise than in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> In the preparation of revised rules of the Circuit Court in advance of the new debt resolution processes provided by the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, our attention was drawn to an issue of concern in regard this provision. Discussion with the Office of the Attorney General led to the conclusion that it would be desirable to repeal the respective subsections and to remove the exceptional provision that, where a court requires additional information or evidence, it could hear it other than in public. The repeal will also avoid any aspersions on the legality of the primary court sitting process in insolvency applications being in public. </p>
          <p eId="para_463"> The outcome of the repeal is that no special protection is provided for any particular element of the debtor's application being considered by the judge. It has not been possible to devise a legally safe provision to allow the judge a discretion to hold back disclosure of any part of an insolvency application from public view during the sitting, for example, orally, by way of a court television screen or otherwise. The insolvency sitting would have to be no different from any other court sitting. This position reflects the wider issues and tensions involved in ensuring that justice be done and be seen to be done in public in the context of our constitutional provisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_464"> Section 65(3) of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1926 may, however, provide some protection through judicial control of documents from the disclosure of documents filed in applications from general public access. This provision could be helpful in insolvency applications.</p>

          <p eId="para_557">The deletion of section 55 of the Bill arises as a consequence of amendment No. 17 which has been discussed previously. That amendment provided a change in section 49(2) of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 to better refer to the more specific instance where an employee of the personal insolvency practitioner could hold a meeting with the debtor in the context of preparing the possible application for a debt settlement arrangement or a personal insolvency arrangement. That amendment will continue to permit better management of the potential caseload of a personal insolvency practitioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> With the acceptance of Amendment No. 17, there is no longer a need for retaining section 55 which had inserted a new section 54A in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 with regard to some delegation of administrative functions by a personal insolvency practitioner.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">These two similar amendments concern the process and procedures governing those situations where a variation of the terms of a debt settlement arrangement or personal insolvency arrangement is proposed. Amendment No. 21 concerns section 82, variation of a debt settlement arrangement, and amendment No. 25 concerns section 119, variation of a personal insolvency arrangement, of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. </p>
          <p eId="para_628"> Following further consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and consideration by the insolvency service, it is proposed to replace the current provisions with regard to the variation of insolvency arrangements with clearer and more extensive provisions. The variation mechanism are now aligned in respect of a debt settlement arrangement and a personal insolvency arrangement with differences between them arising only where the structure or operation of the relevant arrangement so requires. This eliminates any unnecessary differences and inconsistencies between the two mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> The provisions of sections 82 and 119 now clearly set out the roles and responsibilities of the debtor, creditor and personal insolvency practitioner in requesting, processing and participating in a variation mechanism. A variation to an insolvency arrangement may be sought in regard to a change in the income of the debtor and also where an asset has been acquired.</p>

          <p eId="para_745">Amendment No. 27 provides for the replacement of the current section 161 with regard to the making of regulations in respect of the activities of persons authorised to be personal insolvency practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> The changes to section 161, while not extensive, are designed to address concerns that the original text may not be sufficiently broad in regard to certain aspects of the regulation of personal insolvency practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> The proposed section 161(1) now includes a reference to maintaining public confidence in debt settlement arrangements and personal insolvency arrangements as a broad additional policy criterion. It also provides for the ongoing supervision of personal insolvency practitioners, which is a significant requirement for the Insolvency Service of Ireland. In the proposed section 161(1)(a) the requirements in regard to authorisation, supervision and cessation of practice for personal insolvency practitioners are restated in a clear fashion as is a new requirement in regard to the personal insolvency practitioner's dealings with the Insolvency Service of Ireland. In the proposed section 161(1)(b)(v), there is now a new requirement in regard to the case management of debtor's files by the personal insolvency practitioner. The proposed section 161(1)(f) would allow for the setting out of the requirements to be met by a personal insolvency practitioner when handling complaints against him or her. The proposed section 161(1)(g) would allow the Insolvency Service of Ireland to set standards to be adhered to in regard to advertising by personal insolvency practitioners. The previous section 161(1)(f), which dealt with the charging of fees etc. by a personal insolvency practitioner, is reinstated as the proposed section 161(1)(h) with additional clarifications. The proposed section 161(1)(i) would allow the Insolvency Service of Ireland to make regulations for anything which is incidental to that detailed in the section but which is not specifically provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> The proposed section 161(2) would extend the monitoring by the Insolvency Service of Ireland of compliance by personal insolvency practitioners of their obligations to the whole Act and not only in regard to Part 5.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> Amendment No. 28 has the objective of facilitating the orderly regulation of personal insolvency practitioners and the effective use of resources by the Insolvency Service of Ireland by amending section 164(4) of the 2012 Act to permit an authorisation to act as a personal insolvency practitioner to remain in force for a period not exceeding five years rather than one year. This is essentially a provision to assist administrative efficiency and to provide greater certainty for those persons who become personal insolvency practitioners.</p>

          <p eId="para_765">I will take the latter issue first. The Deputy may or may not recall, but I believe I mentioned on Second Stage that when the Courts and Court Officers Bill 2002 was enacted it envisaged increases in jurisdiction in the Circuit Court of up to €100,000. Similar objections were raised on the basis that claims would go up. The reality is that the jurisdiction of the courts has not changed since 1991. Far too much court business, including in the area of personal injuries, is now in the High Court and unnecessary legal costs are being incurred in that area. A substantial body of the work the High Court currently receives could be and will be properly dealt with in the Circuit Court under the Bill. The pressure on the Circuit Court will be relieved by the increased jurisdiction of the District Court resulting in some of the cases currently dealt with at circuit level being dealt with at district level. We will keep a watchful eye on the situation in so far as there are additional pressures on the District Court to ensure that it has the resources necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> There is no basis for the claim that because the court jurisdictions have increased higher awards will be made. There is no research to indicate that claim is correct. It is simply a claim that is made. On the basis of that claim being made we would freeze forevermore court jurisdictions to what they were in 1991. We cannot do that and it makes no sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> There is no real body of evidence to support some of the concerns that have been expressed. There will be an increase in the Circuit Court jurisdiction in the area of personal injuries. Instead of being up to €75,000, as it is across a broad range of areas, personal injuries limits are being kept at €60,000, which is slightly below the inflationary increase that could have been made if our legislative approach had permitted it and, according to my calculations, if we had simply maintained 1991 values. The Circuit Court jurisdiction at the moment is a little over €38,000. Based on inflationary provisions or an increase in the consumer price index since 1991, personal injuries could be brought up to €65,000 and, therefore, we would be in exactly the place we were by way of value in 1991. I have paid some regard to this and perhaps the increase in the personal injuries award size has been less radical and more conservative.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> The increase to €75,000 in other areas is borne based on the need to ensure that there is a degree of certainty about court jurisdictions for a reasonable period. In the past, the practice was that approximately every ten years court jurisdictions would change. Those particular issues were raised in 2002. This is not a party political criticism and it is not intended that way. However, once those issues were raised it seemed the whole system went into a paralysis and nothing happened with court jurisdictions. I have had regard to it. In fact, the claims are not based on any sound evidence that I could rely upon. No one has done research to determine whether if the jurisdiction is increased by a given amount it would produce higher orders made by the courts which, of themselves, would then produce higher insurance charges. I have absolutely no doubt that the Circuit Court Judiciary, which is well used to dealing with financial claims, will apply the same independent assessment of claims of €60,000 or less as were made in the High Court. The benefit is that if one is claiming €60,000 or less then legal costs are likely to be one third less as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> It seems that some of the claims made by those who have raised this issue do not stack up. The reduction applies both to the plaintiff and the defendant. Whether insurance companies are picking up legal costs for those who they are defending, their own legal costs or whether they are required to pay the legal costs of the claimant, there will be considerable savings where awards of €40,000 or €50,000 are made because the legal costs hit will be less. In fact, there may be a saving ultimately to insurance companies and if that occurs I hope it will be reflected in premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">I do not like this concept whereby for an individual citizen who has a genuine - I emphasise genuine - claim, High Court jurisdiction should be maintained at an artificially low level in order that fear of a High Court action would act as a barrier to someone processing a genuine claim. Our courts should not be used in that way and I believe it to be wrong. Therefore, it is correct to take this action.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> Finally, Deputy Niall Collins asked when did I envisage the increase to the court jurisdictions would take place. The courts rules committee must make the relevant rules that are applicable in respect of the District and Circuit Courts but I certainly envisage that the new jurisdictions will be in place in advance of or no later than the commencement of the new legal term after the summer vacation.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_772">I again thank Members opposite, who at all times have raised appropriate questions on this Bill. They have constructively tabled amendments to it and I thank them for their engagement with it. This is another important reforming measure with regard to the courts system. As I mentioned a moment ago in my exchange with Deputy Niall Collins, it will revise the financial jurisdictional base of the District and Circuit Courts for the first time in 22 years. It should reduce legal costs for litigants who must resort to the courts on the civil side in a broad range of areas in which District or Circuit Court jurisdiction is invoked and takes full account of the change in monetary values since this area was last implemented and addressed appropriately in 1991. Moreover, it will relieve some of the pressures on the High Court, where that court is asked to deal with issues relating to financial claims and values that would be more appropriately dealt with at Circuit Court level, and will take out of the Circuit Court claims relating in general terms to sums of €15,000 or less. The District Court is well able to deal with such claims across the broad range of judges within that court and consequently, the influx of work from the High Court into the Circuit Court will be offset by work being transferred down into the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> While this is an important reform, the other important issue in respect of the courts is the provision in the Bill of some new transparency with regard to family cases. I believe Members have got the balance right in ensuring people's privacy and anonymity are protected and the welfare of children is protected, while providing some degree of visibility to the manner in which family cases are heard and determined. This is important in the context of the public having a greater understanding of how the courts work. It also is important for Members of this House as legislators, in that if something is not working well, they will get early notice of that and can then address issues or difficulties that may arise. The media have protected the anonymity of people appropriately in the criminal law area and in particular, I mention the areas of sexual offences and rape offences. However, there are other areas of law in which appropriate privacy also is maintained. I hope and expect the media will apply the same standards to family proceedings and will not report matters that could result in people's identities being revealed or their privacy being invaded. There are, of course, specific penalties and sanctions contained in the Bill as a deterrent to that occurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> Another important reform is the facility to appoint two additional judges to the Supreme Court. Once they have been appointed, I hope this will contribute immediately to easing some of the pressures on the court. I dealt previously today with the court of appeal and it is a two-pronged process to both increase the numbers on the Supreme Court bench and hold the referendum on the court of appeal. Taken as a package, these measures are effecting radical change and reform within the court structure. I believe they are in the public interest and will be widely welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> I also thank Members for their co-operation in dealing with various issues under the insolvency legislation. When it came to the work the Insolvency Service of Ireland was obliged to do, and to the drafting of the various rules and regulations, it became clear that some additional clarity was needed in some sections. I had always stated, in the context of what was a very comprehensive and detailed Bill, that I would revert to the House as rapidly as possible with whatever amendments were required and I thank the Deputies for their co-operation in this regard. The Insolvency Service of Ireland will be fully functioning within a matter of days. As Members are aware, the service was established in March and the rules and regulations relating to personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, have been signed off and published for approximately three weeks. Other rules and regulations of relevance to the service have been made and I am told the information technology system that will ensure less paper is used and there is greater efficiency in communications between it and the courts is at a well-advanced stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> Finally, I thank the officials in my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General for the substantial and speedy work undertaken on this Bill. We have managed to use this Bill to address a broad number of areas, as other reforms are contained in the Bill that fall under the civil law miscellaneous provisions title but to which I will not now refer. However, it was possible to use the Bill as a vehicle to address some issues that have required to be addressed for some time and I thank Members opposite for their co-operation in that regard, as well as my officials and those in the Office of the Attorney General for the substantial work undertaken by them.</p>

            <p eId="para_778">The operation of the electricity grid is a matter for the commercial State companies concerned and is not one in which I have a function; neither do have I a role in making a statement on the operation of the grid in another jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_779"> However, on a more general note, my views and the views the Government on energy infrastructure, which includes the electricity grid, are outlined clearly in the 2012 Government policy statement on the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure. As stated in that statement, energy is the lifeblood of Ireland’s economy and society. Electricity and gas demand for businesses and households must be met safely and securely on a continuous basis, 365 days a year. Our ability to attract and retain foreign direct investment and sustain Irish enterprise depends on guaranteeing energy supply at competitive cost at all times. Ireland needs to deliver a world class electricity transmission system which meets its needs in the 21st century.</p>
            <p eId="para_780"> EirGrid is the independent State-owned body responsible for the operation, development and maintenance of the electricity transmission system. It is licensed as the electricity transmission system operator, TSO, by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, and operates according to the provisions of this licence and under all relevant national and European legislation. The Government endorses the major investment under way in the high voltage electricity transmission system under EirGrid’s GRID25 programme. GRID25 is the most important investment in Ireland’s electricity transmission system for several generations and will position our energy system for decades to come. The GRID25 projects, including GridWest in Mayo, the Meath-Tyrone transmission line and GridLink in the south and east, are vital developments for the regions and for the economy and society as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_781"> It is Government policy and in the national interest, not least in the current economic circumstances, that these investment programmes are delivered in the most cost efficient and timely way possible, on the basis of the best available knowledge and informed engagement on the impacts and the costs of different engineering solutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_782">The integration of the grid by both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland is fundamental to our energy security for the future. There are issues relating to energy security in our neighbouring island. However, there is a plan to have the EU energy system fully integrated by 2014. Is the Minister satisfied that what is in place and the infrastructure being developed will allow us to be fully integrated into the EU internal energy market by 2014? With regard to ensuring there is absolute co-operation between the jurisdictions in the North and South, is there is a need to have discussions about the energy market and energy supplies brought under the remit of the North-South Ministerial Council?</p>

            <p eId="para_783">The thrust of electricity policy is towards integration. There is an all-island market on this island and it is functioning very efficiently. However, the Deputy is correct that meshing the two systems is desirable and very important. The critical piece of infrastructure between Tyrone and Meath is necessary for that. It is estimated, not least by the regulator, that the cost of not building the Meath-Tyrone line is between €20 million and €30 million per annum. The regulator now thinks it will be closer to €30 million forgone as a result of it not being built. The planning application will be lodged at the end of this year. Hopefully, we can navigate our way through the difficulties that still exist. There is community resistance to it and we have leaned over backwards in trying to meet those concerns.</p>

            <p eId="para_785">The completion of the internal energy market was a major issue during the Irish Presidency. We managed to progress the file on that issue quite significantly. It is important, however, to draw a distinction. Completion of the internal energy market by 2014, and if memory serves we have a two-year derogation, is to deal with the policy aspects in terms of design, regulation and so forth. It does not mean that the physical infrastructure will be in place by 2014 to integrate the European electricity system. It means the spade work ought to be completed by then. Ireland is one of the few countries that has made progress on that in terms of the east-west interconnector between Wales and Ireland. However, with regard to the phenomenal investment that will be required to give physical expression to the completion of the Internal Market across Europe, we are talking about billions of euro. It is going slowly.</p>

            <p eId="para_789">I can confirm for the Deputy that the Corrib developers have notified my Department about depressions in Sruwaddacon Bay, which are caused by air escaping during tunnel boring machine "intervention" maintenance, and I wish to confirm that these depressions are not sinkholes. To clarify, the tunnel boring machine, TBM, being used by the developers to tunnel under Sruwaddacon Bay for the purposes of laying the onshore segment of the Corrib gas pipeline requires periodic inspection and maintenance of the mechanical components of the TBM cutter head. Inspections and maintenance on the TBM cutter head are carried out during interventions at above atmospheric pressure and are carried out in accordance with standard industry practice for tunnelling and Health and Safety Authority guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_790"> The air pressure is adjusted and stabilised to safeguard the health and safety of the tunnel operatives and maintain tunnel face stability within the excavation chamber, and is tailored to the anticipated ground conditions at each location. The duration of interventions will vary depending on the nature and extent of the works within the tunnel boring machine. There is always a potential for small scale air loss from the intervention activities, the air loss being a function of the permeability of the ground conditions, and where more permeable material or conduits are present this air loss may migrate to the surface. Local depressions in the seabed can arise as a result of the air loss. These are depressions in the sand and they can be about 50 cm deep when the tide is out. As set out in the works method statement provided by the developers, should such local depressions occur, mitigation by local raking will be undertaken when tidal and site conditions are suitable to accelerate the natural sediment reinstatement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_791"> If there is anybody left following "Oireachtas Report" at this stage, a Cheann Comhairle, they will certainly be fast asleep. I am nodding off myself.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_793"> The areas in which depressions have been observed are in intertidal areas of Sruwaddacon Bay, that is, in areas which dry out during low tide. As the TBM has progressed through the sands, there has also been some minor localised consolidation of less than 10 cm depth of sands along the tunnel trajectory. This consolidation was predicted in the environmental impact statement supporting the application to construct the pipeline and is expected to reinstate itself over a short duration as the TBM progresses.</p>
            <p eId="para_794"> My Department’s consultant tunnelling expert from Environ conducted his most recent site visit last week and a draft report on this visit, including his comments with respect to these depressions, will be published on the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources website as soon as possible. It is important in the meantime to note that the depressions appear to have occurred as a result of air releases during TBM maintenance interventions with no evidence of the tunnel sealant bentonite release to the surface; the depressions have been small relative to the overall context of the bay and there is no evidence of contamination or of any significant environmental harm having occurred as a result of the these events; and in the current circumstances there is no foreseeable way that any of the air release could affect the integrity of the completed tunnel.</p>

            <p eId="para_795">I thank the Minister for his reply. He referred to depressions but local residents describe them as sinkholes and they have erected warning signs along the tunnelling route relating to the final section of the Corrib pipeline. Regardless of whether one refers to it as a depression or a sinkhole, was a phenomenon of this nature predicted in the environmental impact statement submitted during the planning process relating to the project? Local people are of the view that these sinkholes - the Minister refers to them as depressions - constitute a serious risk. Do we have the word of anyone other than the company that escaping air is the only factor contributing to the creation of this phenomenon? I am concerned that depressions or sinkholes will pose a significant risk to the integrity of a pipeline which is being laid across undulating ground. If a sinkhole of a particular size gave rise to the pipeline being fractured, we would then be in serious trouble. Who is responsible for establishing the precise cause of the sinkholes and for ensuring that there will not be consequential or unintended damage as a result of this phenomenon?</p>

It is expected to reinstate itself over a short duration as the TBM process progresses. The Deputy inquired as to whether we are solely dependent on the word of the company. That is not the case. My Department's consultant tunnelling expert from Environ conducted his most recent site visit last week. A draft report on that visit, including his comments with regard to these depressions, will be published on the Department's website. If Deputy Colreavy experiences any difficulty in accessing the draft report online, I will ensure that he obtains a copy. It is important to place on record the fact that the depressions in question appear to have occurred as a result of air releases during the maintenance procedure. Those depressions have, relative to the overall context of the bay, been small and there is no evidence of contamination or any significant environmental harm. There is no foreseeable way that any of the air releases could affect the integrity of the completed tunnel.</p>

            <p eId="para_800">The public service obligation, PSO, levy has been in place since 2001. It is the overall support mechanism for peat generation for certain conventional means of generation constructed for security of supply purposes and for the development of renewable electricity. The levy is designed to compensate electricity suppliers for the additional costs they incur by purchasing electricity generated by these producers, including the three peat stations in the State. Peat-fired electricity plants are supported because they contribute to security of supply through the use of indigenous fuels. The peat PSO for the Edenderry plant, which is operated by Bord na Móna, expires in 2015, while those for the two ESB operated plants at Lough Ree and west Offaly will expire in 2019. I have no plans to end the PSO for peat in advance of the dates for their expiry under the European Commission approvals which were received in 2001. The role of peat-fired power stations in the transition to a low-carbon economy will be an important consideration in preparing the low-carbon roadmap. Interested parties will have an opportunity to make contributions in this regard. The three plants are covered by the requirements of the EU emissions trading system, ETS. Their operators are responsible for the management of emissions from the plants and the Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for monitoring emissions in all plants covered by the ETS.</p>
            <p eId="para_801"> The Government aims to achieve 40% of our electricity requirement from renewable sources by 2020. To this end, my Department is currently supporting renewable electricity generation through the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, schemes. Energy from wind will continue to be the main source of renewable electricity generation in Ireland. Biomass has a contribution to make in reaching our 2020 and low-carbon targets. In February 2012 I opened the renewable energy feed-in tariff for biomass technologies, REFIT 3, which includes incentives for co-firing of up to 30% biomass in the three peat power plants. This will further diversify the sources of electricity on the system and assist with the decarbonisation of our electricity. However, it is a matter for the generation companies involved as to whether they wish to participate in the scheme.</p>

While this is a small element of the overall electricity generation system, the peat-fired process gives rise to high carbon emissions. Such emissions could be significantly reduced by means of a move to biomass. The Government should adopt a policy aimed at encouraging the move from peat-fired to biomass generation. In view of the recent announcement that Coillte and Bord na Móna will soon be operating under the same umbrella, it is timely that a move away from peat firing should begin now.</p>

            <p eId="para_803">In view of the dates I outlined in respect of the end of the PSO, I agree with the Deputy that it is time that we should begin to consider this matter. I cannot dispute what he says with regard to efficiency, emissions and so on. However, in addition to what I stated in my original answer, the PSO also applies in order to protect employment. Bord na Móna is a major employer in the midlands and it has 1,500 people on its books at present who are involved in harvesting. Last year Bord na Móna experienced its worst harvest since it was founded and only realised 37% of its target in this regard. As of Monday last, it had realised 100% - 4 million tonnes of peat - of its harvesting target for the current year.</p>
            <p eId="para_804"> Deputy Pringle is seeking to establish where we go from here. We have raised similar questions with the ESB. As I understand it, converting the plants in question to biomass would prove problematic in the case of two out of the three. The difficulties which arise relate to the age of the plants, the technology on site, adaptability etc. However, the matter is being examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_805">I am not seeking to have an impact on the employment created by Bord na Móna. However, the staff involved could be utilised in the wood biomass sector and the level of employment could actually increase if Bord na Móna makes the move to which I refer. As Bord na Móna and Coillte come closer together, I hope the opportunities which will arise will be availed of and that the level of employment in the forestry sector will increase. This would also feed in to the changeover to biomass in the area of electricity generation.</p>

Even if we were to return to Europe in order to obtain approval for a new PSO or for an extension of the current one, the indications are that neither of these might be forthcoming. Edenderry is a co-fired station and could certainly be adapted. However, technical constraints apply in respect of the other two stations. The ESB is currently considering the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_808">Ireland is the only country in the EU and the OECD that does not have a national postcode and the Government is strongly committed to introducing a national postcode system. The new postcode system will be an important part of national infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_809"> The procurement process to select a postcode management licence holder to implement a national postcode system has been protracted and is ongoing. Intensive work has taken place on what is an extremely complex national project. The total cost of the postcode system will be determined through the procurement process. Therefore, I cannot give any estimate as to the cost of rolling out a national postcode system at this time. </p>
            <p eId="para_810"> However, I can say at this stage that the final invitation to tender has already issued.

            <p eId="para_815">What I put formally on the record is correct because apart from efficiency and quality, there are many logistical companies and companies that engage in target marketing certain segments of the population. All of that is likely to generate business for An Post. I do not believe this will be a negative for An Post. It will be a big plus for business because there are segments of business in this digital age that require a national postcode system. There are several Departments such as the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Social Protection and so on for which this will be a major advantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_816"> I agree with the Deputy that there will be a necessity for an information campaign. We cannot take the support of the public on this for granted. I was very nervous about switching over to digital television last year but making a hames of a national postcode would put that in the shade. It is a complex proposal and it will have to be handled carefully.</p>

An Post is behind this proposal. It acknowledges that as the only country in the OECD that does not have a national postcode system, we have to get on with it. It sees possibilities in it for the generation of business that cannot be done at present under the old system. In circumstances where its core business, the mails business, has been in decline for some years now, it is confident about this proposal and it believes it will help to arrest that trend.</p>

            <p eId="para_820">As stated in the Deputy’s question, suggestions of viable, lucrative and supra-normal profit generating finds are speculative. This type of speculation is regrettably inconsistent - I wish it were not - with experience to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_821"> In over 40 years of exploration there have been four commercial natural gas discoveries in the Irish offshore, namely, the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads producing gas fields off the coast of Cork and the Corrib gas field off the coast of North Mayo, which has not been brought ashore yet. There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date, although one would never think that with some of the commentary.</p>
            <p eId="para_822"> In 2011 alone the Norwegian authorities approved 11 new oil-gas production facilities. The employment, economic and fiscal dividend from oil and gas that is enjoyed by Norway is the product of nearly 60 years of oil and gas production based on proven prospectivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_823"> There has been a modest but welcome increase in the level of interest in oil and gas exploration off our coast in recent years, yet the fact remains that the Irish offshore is relatively under-explored and its petroleum potential is largely unproven. Ireland’s focus needs to be on how to encourage an increase in the level of exploration drilling. The Dunquin well, which is being drilled by ExxonMobil on Frontier Exploration Licence 3/04, will be the only well spudded in the Irish offshore in either 2012 or 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_824"> Over the years Ireland, along with many other countries, has continually reviewed, adapted and evolved its regulatory and fiscal terms to ensure they remain fit for purpose, and that process will continue. As I stated during the recent debate on the report of the former Joint Committee on Communications, Natural Resources and Agriculture on the subject of offshore oil and gas exploration, my intention is to seek additional independent expert advice, by year end, on what level of fiscal gain is achievable for the people of Ireland, and the mechanisms best suited to produce such a gain.</p>

            <p eId="para_825">In a recent study worldwide it was ascertained that Ireland has the second lowest tax in the world - Cameroon has the lowest tax - on royalty benefits to the State. This is alarming because it has also been reckoned that there is the equivalent of 10 billion barrels of oil reserves off our west coast alone. As the Minister said, much of this is non-viable but if we could extract a fraction of those 10 billion barrels, we would be well on the way to our economic and financial situation being in a much better position that it is at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_826"> The Norwegian experience is noteworthy. It has put in place sufficient rules and regulations to accumulate sizeable profits from the oil exploration companies.</p>

There is procrastination about it. That project is of enormous value to Count Kerry. As we are well aware, from €500 million to €1 billion, in rough figures, has been mentioned in terms of investment by that company. There is a large number of jobs involved. I ask the Minister to intervene with the regulator to ensure that this contentious issue about the interconnection tariffs is sorted out immediately. This matter is a related issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_829">I agree with Deputy Fleming about the importance of landing an LNG project for Tarbert. It would be a considerable boost to the local area. Even more importantly, it would be an additional string in this country's energy security bow. As the Deputy knows, the matter is before the High Court at the moment. I hope a decision will be handed down before the courts rise for the summer recess.</p>
            <p eId="para_830"> I would like to respond briefly to what the Deputy said about the oil and gas situation. I suppose one can prove anything with statistics. I do not know whether there are 10 billion barrels out there. I would settle for much less if we could make a strike between now and Christmas. The problem is that we will not know unless we can increase the level of exploration. We need to do that and we are trying to do so. In other words, we need to fix the fiscal regime at a level that does not frighten off companies that are likely to explore and drill. The Deputy's question referred to Dunquin, for example. When of all that business is finished, there will be very little change out of €200 million. It is extremely costly. Obviously, the State does not have that kind of money.</p>

            <p eId="para_833">I would like to mention some of the figures that are on the record. It is estimated that there are over 1.7 billion barrels in the Providence company's Barryroe field, which is south of the County Cork coast. It appears that 270 million barrels can be pumped in a viable manner. The Minister mentioned the Dunquin field, which is also very promising. These estimated figures are significant when one considers that oil is selling for between $90 and $100 per barrel. The unfortunate position we have inherited is the result of some very rash political decisions that were made in the past. The Minister and the Government are realistic about this. We should act in a step-by-step manner in revisiting this issue. Surely we can find a means of protecting ourselves because we need these important funds for our education, health and welfare systems and to deal with the issues we are facing. We do not have much to fall back on. I think we can retrieve this.</p>

Those of us on this side of the House are at least as enthusiastic as Deputy Fleming about the possibility of an oil strike off the Irish offshore. That is the kind of fillip the industry needs. There is a great deal of excitement around at the moment. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, who is more hands-on in this regard than I am, advises me that eight of the 13 licences have already been converted, which means there will be exploration. It is possible that two more of them will follow suit. We hope one of them is positive. If we are to test Deputy Fleming's theory, we have to get more activity off the Irish offshore.</p>

            <p eId="para_840">At the outset, I acknowledge the contribution of the independent radio sector in bringing diversity to the airwaves and serving the needs of communities, often at a very local level. Having said that, it needs to be borne in mind that these stations were established as commercial entities. Station owners sought and accepted licences on clear terms, which included a limited amount of public service-type content. In many cases, their success in the licence application process was assisted by the voluntary commitments they gave regarding the provision of public service-type content, over and above that required by the relevant legislation. The licences were accepted in full knowledge of the current system of public funding. It is certainly regrettable that some of these stations are experiencing an understandable degree of financial stress. While that is a cause for concern, it does not mean the State should step in and provide funding. They are and remain commercial enterprises. It should also be noted that their popularity in the communities they serve is, in many cases, a distinct result of the local news content and current affairs programming they provide. That, in turn, gives them a strong advertising presence and thus earning potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_841"> The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasters is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their statutory public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence. This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs. The overall aim of public service broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected. Through the obligations placed on the public service broadcasters, which are explicitly set out in legislation passed by the Oireachtas, and through the criteria for the funding of content through the Sound and Vision scheme, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interest programming is strongly promoted. Over the last number of years, there have been calls from a wide range of media organisations regarding the future distribution of licence fee funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_842"> I am committed to the introduction of the proposed public service broadcasting charge, which will be household-based. The extent of the additional funding which may be yielded by this measure is unclear. As the charge will replace the TV licence, the first obligation of the revenue from the charge will be to ensure adequate funding for public service broadcasting. Therefore, before considering any wider distribution of public funds than that which applies at present, I would have to be convinced that such a distribution would represent a sound proposition in terms of policy for the sector and would not be to the ultimate disadvantage of public service broadcasters. I should clarify that if I were minded to provide public moneys to private investors, EU state aid rules would apply. It is categorically not possible for the State simply to decide to fund a set of incumbent licence holders during a licence period. Such a move, quite apart from the reaction of the European authorities, would expose the State to the risk of litigation from other operators who may have considered applying for a licence if such a revenue stream had been available.</p>

            <p eId="para_843">I recognise and value the work done by RTE and TG4. In general, their broadcasting is of a very high standard. Local radio provides a public service, particularly in areas that cannot access RTE services. I would not argue that State funding should be made available to fund private broadcasting enterprises. However, I think there are community groups and projects that could do with exposure to the wider community. I ask the Minister to consider engaging with communities and supporting them in getting their message out via local radio. I also ask him to consider assisting not-for-profit community radio stations like Near FM in Dublin that provide a public service.</p>

            <p eId="para_844">I agree with what the Deputy has said. Local radio is very important. It is quite remarkable that the regional radio stations have 60% of the audience. They provide public service content of merit, above and beyond what the legislation requires.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">They have a tremendously loyal audience and perform a very important role, as Deputy Colreavy notes. I spoke at the annual conference of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland this year and met with people from Near FM. They put certain propositions to me in respect of the issues raised by the Deputy, including the question of representation for local community radio on the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. I assured them that I would be happy to look at that.</p>

            <p eId="para_847">RTE is probably as commercial as any other television and radio broadcaster in the country so I find it very difficult to understand why the European Commission would look upon RTE as being totally different. I know my own radio station in Kildare, KFM, covers a huge amount of local and national issues. Perhaps when the next round of licences is published, the Minister might broaden it so that some form of subvention can be given to some of these stations that provide vital services in their local communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_848">I can tell Deputy Moynihan that I intend at 4 p.m. today to lay the report of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland before both Houses. Under the 2009 Act, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is required to produce a fundamental review of funding for public service broadcasting as against the statutory objects in the Act that are on the public service broadcasters. This is the first time this has happened since 2009. The authority produced the report for me and I brought it to Government yesterday. It will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. If the spokespersons want a briefing or material on it, I will be glad to provide them.</p>
            <p eId="para_849"> In response to Deputy Lawlor's statement that RTE is as commercial as anyone else, I agree with what he said about KFM. However, it is not accurate to say that RTE is as commercial as any other station and, therefore, there is an issue regarding State aid for it or private commercial broadcasters. Under the legislation establishing RTE and as it has evolved since then, there are a number of impositions on RTE and TG4 that they must statutorily perform. Those impositions do not apply to private commercial television or independent radio. They are laid down by law. In the 2009 Act, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is required to measure the performance against those statutory impositions and see whether public funding is adequate.</p>
            <p eId="para_850"> RTE has been run on a dual-funded model since it was founded, in other words, through the TV licence and commercial revenue. There is significant evasion in respect of the TV licence fee of the order of €30 million. In addition to evasion, technology means that many people are accessing RTE material on their iPhone or iPad. The collapse in commercial revenue is hugely significant. It has come down by €84 million since 2008. The reason for that is not just the recession but the fact that a large proportion of the advertising budget is migrating online. At the end of last year, something like 20% of the advertising budget went online to companies that can target segments of the audience to whom they want to sell product. I must look at the question raised by Deputy Lawlor in the context of the debate that will take place following the laying of the two reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am aware of the argument he makes for the independent broadcasting sector.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_297" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_853">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 11 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_854"> The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a binding target where at least 16% of our energy requirements should come from renewable sources by 2020. In order to meet our overall 16% requirement, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport from renewable sources. Although these targets are challenging, I am confident they can be met. My Department's strategy for renewable energy for the 2012 to 2020 period sets out the key strategic goals for the various renewable energy sectors in the context of Ireland's EU obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_855"> In addition, under the directive, Ireland is required to set out in a national renewable energy action plan, NREAP, the trajectory towards meeting its legally binding targets. The NREAP and the first progress report on the NREAP, which are available on my Department's website, show the sectoral and technology breakdown that we anticipate in the achievement of our target. By the end of 2011, we had reached 6.4% of overall energy consumption from renewable sources and the trajectory set out in the NREAP assumes that we will achieve the 16% target incrementally at approximately 1% per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_856"> To date, wind energy has been the largest driver of growth in renewable electricity, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. In 2012, 15.5% of Ireland's electricity demand was met by wind generation. By the end of the first quarter<i>
							</i>of 2013, 1,763 MW of wind generation capacity was connected to the grid. At the end of May this year, the total amount of renewable generation capacity connected to the grid was just over 2,000 MW. It is estimated that between 3,500 and 4,000 MW of renewable generation capacity will be required to allow Ireland meet its 40% renewable electricity target.</p>
            <p eId="para_857"> Under the gate 3 grid connection process, grid connection offers have now issued to just under 4,000 MW of renewable generation, the bulk of which is wind. I understand that gate 3 acceptances are scheduled to complete in October this year. These acceptances will give further momentum to meeting the renewable generation target.</p>
            <p eId="para_858"> There are a number of policy measures in place designed to incentivise the development necessary to meet Ireland's renewable energy obligations. The primary support mechanisms for renewable electricity are the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, schemes. These schemes are designed to provide certainty to renewable electricity generators by providing them with a minimum floor price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a defined period. Using a fixed feed-in tariff mechanism, the certainty afforded by a guaranteed minimum price allows developers to access finance for renewable developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_859"> In the second round of REFIT – REFIT 2, a total of 4,000 MW can be supported. In order to ensure the necessary incentives are in place to encourage the level of investment required to maintain the rate of build of onshore wind necessary to meet our national target for renewable electricity, earlier this year I decided to amend the terms of REFIT 2 to extend the closing date for applications to 31 December 2015, with projects required to be built by the end of December 2017. Support under REFIT 2 cannot exceed 15 years and will not extend beyond the end of December 2032.</p>
            <p eId="para_860"> The REFIT 3 support for biomass combined heat and power, CHP, technologies, is supporting progress on our renewable heat target. Measures such as the bio-fuel obligation scheme to increase the use of bio-fuels and the electric vehicle grant scheme to incentivise the purchase of new electric vehicles are the mechanisms being used to achieve our target for renewable transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">Policy interventions through the ReHeat scheme, energy efficiency schemes, building regulations, REFIT 3 and CHP and natural market migration to renewable heating technologies will deliver the majority of the 12% renewable heat target.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_863">In addition, later this year I will publish a national bioenergy strategy which will further outline the role energy from biomass will play in contributing to the achievement of our national targets and, in particular, the target for the heat sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_864"> With regard to Ireland's potential to produce renewable electricity beyond the level required by the 2020 target, expert advice suggests Ireland has the capability to achieve our national targets for renewable electricity from onshore renewable generation alone. However, it is widely recognised that Ireland has an excellent and abundant renewable energy resource which has the potential to produce amounts of renewable electricity significantly in excess of the amounts required to meet our 2020 target. It is in this context the opportunity to harness this resource for the export market, and realise its potential for investment, job creation and economic growth, has been identified and is being pursued with the UK Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_865">A number of microprojects cannot progress because of the cost of connecting to the national grid. Individually they are small fry but together a number of such microprojects have the potential to contribute fairly significantly to renewable energy in Ireland.

            <p eId="para_866">Microgeneration has been a problem in the country. The ESB was the only supplier prepared to take it on board and the uptake was not great. I suppose if it were commercially viable the others would be doing it also. Given the step-down in economic activity we have experienced in recent times there is not a big demand at present. We are examining the question of microgeneration and we are in discussion with the stakeholders. It will take a little time.</p>

            <p eId="para_868">Three onshore licensing options were granted by the previous Minister of State at the Department, Conor Lenihan, in February 2011 immediately prior to the general election. Two were over parts of the north west carboniferous basin of Lough Allen and one was over parts of County Clare. These licensing options conferred upon the holders the first right to apply for an exploration licence. I can confirm that two of the three companies have submitted applications for a follow-on exploration licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_869"> The Government has made it clear that any application for an exploration licence for hydraulic fracturing as part of unconventional gas exploration would be subject to an environmental impact assessment. It has also made clear that such assessment would be informed by the findings of further research to be commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and that absolutely no decision would be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing in exploration drilling in Ireland until there has been time to consider the outcome of this further research.</p>
            <p eId="para_870"> Earlier this year the EPA announced the draft terms of reference for the more extensive second stage of its research, the final results of which are expected in early 2015.

            <p eId="para_871">I wrote to the EPA on this when the terms of reference were published. I am not at all happy adequate socio-economic impact analysis has been done on hydraulic fracturing, including on the impact on the tourism and agrifood industries. Last year, the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, very graciously came to us in north Leitrim and we went up Boleybrack Mountain to see a red grouse management project. When we were on top of Boleybrack Mountain I pointed over to Thur Mountain, which is a beautiful hillside, and told the Minister it would be the centre of fracking if it is allowed in Ireland and asked him to imagine a tourist coming to look at an industrial wasteland. The Minister's honest answer was that he could not imagine a tourist doing so. I think the very same about the Clare basin. I am not at all convinced the work which will come from the EPA will include the detailed socio-economic research and analysis required before a decision of such import is made for the people of Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo, Clare and Donegal.</p>

            <p eId="para_872">Hydraulic fracturing is not an industrial wasteland. I have been to the United States and looked at a site after hydraulic fracturing had taken place and it looks like any normal rural landscape. The assessment which must take place must consider the potential impact of the project on the population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, the architectural and archaeological heritage, the landscape and the interrelationship between all of these factors. Under an EU directive it will not be possible to permit any such project unless it can be determined following assessment that it would not have an unacceptable environmental or social impact. The findings of this EPA research will provide a benchmark for assessment of these requirements. More than 1,308 submissions were received and are being considered. It is expected a call for tender will issue shortly in this regard. We must deal with facts and science in the issues raised. It is wrong to raise issues about industrial wastelands when no such facts exist anywhere.</p>

            <p eId="para_873">The Taoiseach was generous in his praise of fracking in Pennsylvania last January 12 months. I have letters in my file from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection advising people the waters were poisoned and there was a risk of explosion in their houses because of escaping methane gas. I ask the Minister of State not to lecture me on hydraulic fracturing. Nobody is speaking to the people who were affected by fracking in Pennsylvania or anywhere else in the United States. The Government is speaking to industrialists and those making money from it but not to the people affected by it, who are the very people the Government should be speaking to because they are the type of people who will be hit here.</p>

We must deal with facts, and we will not have the facts until the research is done. All of the issues the Deputy mentioned including the people, the population, the economic conditions, the flora, fauna, the archaeology, the heritage and the landscape are being studied and this is a fact. This is the only fact, and until we have the report, which will not happen until 2015, no decision will be made. People must understand and appreciate this fully, absolutely and categorically. Nothing will happen until this report is in and no other application will be considered by the Department in the meantime. I want absolute clarity on this.</p>

            <p eId="para_876">Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and natural gas market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is an independent statutory regulator. I am very mindful of the importance of well-functioning energy markets for business and domestic consumers. The Government remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on prices in the electricity and gas markets in Ireland. There is competition in both markets, with many players competing in the wholesale and retail segments of the electricity market and in the retail segment of the gas market. New players have moved into the various segments over the years, which is a welcome development, and which has increased competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_877"> The regulator has issued eight licences in the electricity and gas supply sectors. The competitive market gives consumers considerable flexibility in choosing their energy suppliers. Furthermore, the regulator's simple switching process and the accredited independent price comparison websites, <i>bonkers.ie</i> and <i>uswitch.ie</i> help consumers to identify the electricity and gas products and price plans best suited to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_878"> Business and domestic consumers can choose from a range of suppliers in electricity and gas.

            <p eId="para_879">A number of issues arise in terms of the flexibility for all businesses. Arrears is one issue and another is customers who wish to move. Issues also arise in connection with the price increase. The argument has been made in committee meetings with the energy regulator. The industry and people with small businesses have informed us that only three countries in the EU - Cyprus, Greece and Italy - had higher price increases than this country. One could ask why that is the case. It is constantly said that not enough is being done about price. We have had the argument about price increases with the regulator. The ESB is one of the major electricity producers and it has made considerable profits. It is difficult to explain the position to people who are trying to work through arrears of up to €500 when they know they could get a cost reduction by shifting their business elsewhere. There must be more flexibility within the system.</p>

            <p eId="para_880">Eight suppliers operate in the electricity market and there are coincidentally eight active suppliers licensed by the regulator in the gas market. For a country our size there is certainly adequate competition, but as the Deputy fairly points out, energy prices in this country are high. That is partly because we are an isolated island that has not generated any of its own fuel in terms of oil or gas to any persistent or regular extent.</p>
            <p eId="para_881"> There is a practice involved of debt flagging in terms of switching providers. Switching has been significant. There must be a system of debt flagging because otherwise there is the phenomenon known as debt hopping. In other words, one accumulates arrears and then one switches to a different supplier. That must be taken on board as well and acknowledged that it is a problem. Some 250,000 customers switched their electricity supplier in 2012. They were composed of 215,000 domestic customers, 33,500 small businesses, 3,000 medium businesses and 231 large energy users. In the gas market, 110,000 customers switched, almost 17%. They were composed of 106,000 domestic customers and 3,867 business customers. There is competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_882"> Deputy Moynihan is correct; the profits of the supply companies seem to be large. In the case of the State companies where we have some say as shareholder, of course investment is needed to maintain the system. The capital investment in the ESB alone this year will be €888 million. It is a huge spend that does benefit the economy and whereas the profits might seem large, investment must be made in order to continue to modernise and build out the transmission system.</p>

            <p eId="para_887"> In contrast, the latest, All-Island Generation Capacity Statement for 2013-22, published in January this year, forecast that the adequacy situation in this country is positive for the next ten years. Indeed there is a considerable generation surplus forecast for the Irish electricity system. In terms of long term plans for energy security, Ireland’s approach is to diversify fuels and supply sources. The use of indigenous gas and access to gas and liquefied natural gas storage will enhance diversity. Continuing to develop indigenous renewable electricity is also a key strategy in ensuring supply diversity and supports are in place to ensure we attain our 2020 target of having 40% of electricity generated from renewable sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_888"> The network companies, ESB Networks, EirGrid, BGE and Gaslink, will continue to improve the resilience of our electricity and gas networks in their development plans. These actions will continue to enhance our long term energy security. Moreover, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which is funded and assisted by my Department has, over the past decade, been very proactive in maximising energy efficiency. Several successful initiatives have been undertaken and continue. New initiatives are also being considered which will further improve the efficiency of energy consumption. As well as enhancing long term energy security, we must be mindful of the potential for unexpected short-term disruption to energy supplies and in that regard there are detailed operational plans in place. In the unlikely event of a major disruption EirGrid and Gaslink would implement their respective emergency plans to deal with the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_891">Yes. I beg the Minister’s pardon. A couple of issues arise. Are any energy shortage shocks foreseen in the short term or long term in the information received by the Minister from the various bodies? How strenuous have the stress tests been that have taken place? Is the Minister satisfied that the sale of Bord Gáis will not create any difficulty for the energy market in the short, medium or long term?</p>

            <p eId="para_892">Touch wood, but I think I can give the Deputy the assurance he seeks in the sense that no such circumstances are envisaged. That said, we are at the end of the pipeline. We are a remote island on the verge of Europe and we saw what happened only a couple of winters’ ago when Russia turned off the pipeline. The Deputy is asking me to look into a crystal ball. In terms of our capacity to meet market demand at the moment and for the foreseeable future, unless there were some kind of cataclysmic event affecting supply from the neighbouring island, no such set of circumstances are foreseen.</p>
            <p eId="para_893"> I can assure the Deputy that in respect of the privatisation of the energy division of Bord Gáis Éireann, it should have no impact on security of supply because the State will retain ownership and control of the networks in this country, even if Bord Gáis Éireann has a different name at that time. That ought not to be an issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_894"> I agree with the Deputy that our people generally take for granted that there is no need to be concerned about energy security. They presume that, when they plug in kettles in the morning or turn on switches at night, there will be light and that the kettles will boil. Energy security must be a concern. Yesterday, I met the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, the body responsible for the acquisition and storage of critical oil supplies to meet our 90-day target. It has made tremendous progress in recent times, with 71% of oil stocks being stored in this jurisdiction for the first time ever. Even five years ago, that figure was 43%. Gradually, NORA has built up to 71% of our critical oil stocks needs being sourced in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_895"> I do not trivialise the question. This is a serious issue, but people would only acknowledge it as being critical if it arose.</p>

If it is accurate, is a long-term strategy possible?</p>

            <p eId="para_910">Wave and tidal energy technology is still at the research, development and demonstration stage globally. Ireland has a rich ocean resource and significant potential in this regard. In order to take forward the ocean energy strategy, the OEDU was established in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, in 2009. This unit has been taking forward the development of the sector through administration of a prototype development fund of grants for industry. The SEAI has also been progressing the development of a full-scale grid-connected wave test site near Belmullet, County Mayo, which would complement existing wave testing facilities such as the wave tank in Cork and the quarter-scale wave testing site in Galway Bay.</p>
            <p eId="para_911"> The Government recognises the potential of our indigenous wave energy resource and the research and development and job potential in this area. In the context of overall reducing budgets, the capital allocation for the ocean energy programme was increased to €5 million for 2013, bringing the cumulative amount of expenditure on ocean energy in the period 2009-13 to almost €21 million. The offshore renewable energy development plan, which will, <i>inter alia</i>, address resources for the sector, is being finalised and will be published following approval by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_912"> In terms of staffing, my Department and all of the agencies under its aegis must operate within the employment control framework put in place by the Government with the aim of reducing public sector employment numbers over time. To assist this process, workforce action plans are used to match resources with business policy needs. Staff allocation within the SEAI is in the first instance a matter for the chief executive in the context of the agency's workforce action plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_913">The Minister used to have four full-time staff working in this area, but now he is down to two. They also have other responsibilities, resulting in telephone calls and e-mails on the issue of ocean development not being answered.</p>
            <p eId="para_914"> There is potential, but large multinationals have their eye on the resources off our shores. Meanwhile, small developers have spent hundreds of thousands of euro of their own money to develop protocols and prototypes, but they have taken that work as far as they possibly can. Should the Minister not bring these small organisations together and work with them, perhaps under the auspices of the ESB, so that we can harness the potential for Ireland's economy instead of allowing the benefit to be hived off to the multinationals? I understand that large Australian multinationals are interested in the development off Belmullet. Would we not be better off supporting our small, indigenous companies?</p>

            <p eId="para_915">Wave and tidal energy technology is still at the research stage. Notwithstanding the economic constraints on the Government, we have managed more than to keep the programmes alive. Given our current circumstances and the impact of some of the adjustments that must be made, not everyone would agree that wave and tidal technology ought to be a priority. I agree with the Deputy that wave and tidal energy research could be important for this country. Some international experts affirm the view that we have considerable potential in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_916"> It is true that staffing in the SEAI was reduced from 72 to 55. This is typical of the reductions in staffing that have taken place in various public sector organisations throughout the country, leading to well in excess of 30,000 public servants no longer being in employment in the public sector. We know the history of that and I do not want to go back over it.</p>
            <p eId="para_917"> However, we have spent €21 million in this area and we have valuable projects extant and being supported. Last week, the Taoiseach turned the sod in Ringaskiddy on the Beaufort Laboratory. This will support the Irish maritime and energy resource cluster, IMERC, facility, which is performing leading edge work and innovation in conjunction with the Naval Service and University College Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_918"> We are managing to keep these initiatives afloat, if the Deputy will forgive the pun. Doing so is extremely difficult, given the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_921">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> I am pleased to bring the Child and Family Agency Bill 2013 before the House. I look forward to engaging with Deputies in a constructive debate as the Bill proceeds through the various stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> The Bill I am introducing today represents the legislative element of one of the current Government's largest public service reforms. More importantly, however, it represents the most ambitious and comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support services ever undertaken in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> The need for change is undeniable. It can be read in the pages of nearly 20 major reports from the past 30 years on child protection failings in Ireland. It can be evidenced in the stark findings of service dysfunction, fragmentation and lack of inter-agency working contained in last year's report of the Independent Child Death Review Group. It can be seen in the structural and systemic deficits and inconsistencies still there in our services, highlighted both in recent HIQA inspections and in last month's pilot phase report of the National Audit of Neglect.</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> Across many of these reports, the only consistent theme was inconsistency over the decades. We saw how dedicated staff went above and beyond the call of duty, but we also saw how some fell far short. We saw how some geographic regions were excellent in how they operated, but we also saw how some needed huge improvements. We saw how many legislative and financial supports were robustly in place, but we also saw how some were treated as just purely aspirational.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> Worst of all, was the revelation of what we did not know as a result of the lack of basic data on children in care, on referrals and on service provision generally. If these revelations of systemic gaps and failures related to industrial production, or electricity supply, they would have been shameful. They did not relate to wiring and machines, however, they related to the safety, protection and well-being of the nation's children.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> Understanding this legacy is critical, because doing things differently means proactively identifying failures, naming them and correcting them. We cannot fix what we cannot see. This is at the heart of this Government's change agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_928"> We have introduced new Children First national guidance and we have overseen a Children First implementation framework. Only yesterday, I secured Cabinet approval for the publication of sectoral implementation plans for Children First by a number of Departments on their websites. We will now know what each Department is doing to implement the Children First national guidance.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> We have introduced the first ever national standards for child protection services and an independent inspection regime under HIQA, which is very important. This standards-led approach is central to fostering a new culture of transparency, accountability and effectiveness. We have recruited more social workers, have led service reforms to improve capacity and consistency, are designing new models for assessment and referral, and are reorganising care services. In addition, we are implementing new models for data management and performance monitoring.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> For all of this, however, there is a greater challenge outstanding - it comprises leadership, focus and accountability. We must emancipate our child protection and welfare services from the monolith of the health services, where for too long in the past they were lost and rudderless. We must also break down the barriers between agencies and services. We must have much more seamless integration of policy and service delivery, not fragmentation, and we must do better for children and families.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> In 2011, I established a task force chaired by Ms Maureen Lynott to advise me on establishment of the new agency. I wish to thank Ms Lynott and the advisory group for their work. Their report, which was published 12 months ago, spoke of the "once in a generation opportunity to fundamentally reform children's services in Ireland". The Bill I am presenting today seeks to make that opportunity real. It provides the organisational context, leadership focus and accountability within which real improvements in child and family services can be achieved. It will ensure that the change agenda we have initiated is championed, sustained and built upon into the future. Just as the creation of my Department brought child-related policy out of the shadow of the Department of Health into the direct light of ministerial, Cabinet and public scrutiny, so this legislation will once and for all move the services for children and their families into the light of day. Put simply, we are going to move from a position where child and family welfare was barely a priority, to a position where it will be the sole focus of a single dedicated State agency, overseen by a single dedicated Department. In doing so, we are delivering on a key programme for Government commitment and on what has been an absolute priority for me as Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_932"> While today marks the start of the legislative process, much work has already been undertaken on the logistical, organisational and financial management aspects of the establishment and transition to the new agency. This has also included the recruitment of a senior management team led by CEO designate, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, and the appointment of Ms Norah Gibbons as first chairperson. I understand they will be shortly appearing before the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> This Bill seeks to facilitate each of the distinct elements that make up the programme for Government's commitment through the creation of an agency which is solely and exclusively dedicated to children and families; has an improved range of services to meet the needs of children and families; and is subject to best practice in the discharge of its accountability to the Government and the Oireachtas. The need for a dedicated agency recognises that the complex operational management and reform of child welfare and protection services has jostled with many other competing objectives within the large and demanding health and personal social service arena.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> This Bill provides the mandate to a dedicated agency to lead the improvement of children's services. It will allow for the development of expertise and support for professionals in delivering some of the most complex interventions the State is charged with undertaking. The Bill provides that the Child and Family Agency assume responsibility for a range of services from establishment day. These services include child welfare and protection services, including family support services; existing family support agency responsibilities; existing National Educational Welfare Board responsibilities; pre-school inspection services; domestic, sexual and gender based violence services; and services related to the psychological welfare of children. Cumulatively, this represents the largest and most ambitious public service reform being undertaken by this Government, involving 4,000 staff across three existing agencies and a budget of nearly €600 million. </p>
          <p eId="para_935"> The children and family services transferring from the HSE include the full range of family support and child welfare services, child protection, foster care, residential care, after care and adoption services. This includes responsibility for over 6,200 children in care and 1,500 young people in receipt of after-care services as well as responding to nearly 40,000 child protection and welfare referrals every year. The incorporation of pre-school inspection services will further promote a nationally consistent approach to regulation, inspection and enforcement - all of which are key elements of my Department's ongoing pre-school quality agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> The transfer of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services from the HSE is important in equipping the agency to provide an integrated service to vulnerable families. Support to victims and groups working with those experiencing such violence, including rape crisis centres and refuges, will in future be the responsibility of the Child and Family Agency. The HSE will retain responsibility for sexual assault treatment units, which are located in acute hospitals, and other medical services.</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> While improving child protection has rightly been an issue of much focus in recent times, and will be a key objective of the new agency, prevention, early intervention and family support are equally, if not more important goals for the agency. The task force recommended that the design of services within the agency must be based upon the needs of children and families, rather than existing professional or organisational boundaries. This is about services for children and families. It said comprehensive, early and multi-disciplinary responses are required to meet the needs of children and families.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> Factors such as poverty and deprivation, early-school leaving, mental health and substance misuse are very real for families and can impact significantly on children's well-being. The pilot phase report of the National Audit of Neglect Cases, published recently, highlighted what it referred to as the "harsh reality of neglect".</p>
          <p eId="para_939">The audit found that parental alcohol misuse was a factor in 62% of families in the overall sample and states that family dysfunction was often associated with chronic alcohol and drug misuse<i>. </i>Too often, it is the interplay of such trends and risk factors that act to expose children to serious risk. Therefore, it is important that universal, easily accessible services within the community work to promote children's outcomes, including child welfare, and have a clear role to support child development and family functioning while always being vigilant and responsive to child protection issues. This requires strong linkages between universal and targeted or more specialist children's services. Therefore, the new agency will have a strong role in prevention and early intervention and in supporting families and communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_940"> Much work is under way and at an advanced stage in child and family services on the development of new models of case intake, assessment and referral to include both a greater differentiation between child protection and welfare referrals and a greater focus on early intervention and community-based family support interventions. One of the lessons we have learned, in particular from the child death report, is the need for this differentiation and clear risk assessment to ensure children get the precise services they need. Building on this work, the Bill provides for a much expanded range of services as compared with those currently delivered within HSE child welfare and protection services. In line with the agency's commitment to early intervention and family support, the Bill provides for it providing psychological services to children and families. Such services could, for example, deal with emotional and behavioural problems, attachment difficulties, relationship difficulties or poor parenting. These services relate to any family in the community experiencing such difficulties. In addition, psychological services would form part of the specialist supports available to children who have experienced abuse or who are in the care of the State. These children need these services as much, if not more, as anyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_941"> The new agency will build on the excellent work undertaken by the Family Support Agency over the past decade. The nationwide network of 106 family resource centres will play a centrally important role in the new agency and its continuum of community supports. I want to make that very clear because it is an important part of the new agency. The Family Support Agency funds more than 600 voluntary and community organisations in providing counselling services to couples and families. This Bill provides that all of the functions and staff of the Family Support Agency will transfer to the child and family agency on establishment. Inclusion of these services will assist in ensuring the ethos of the child and family agency is based upon partnership with communities. Deputies will see how clearly this is spelled out in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> Earlier this week, I launched the Family Support Agency commissioned study, Families Living at Risk of Poverty in Ireland.<i>
						</i>This study found that in those families at risk of poverty, the majority of mothers and fathers had not continued education past lower secondary school level. This is a finding which far too often echoes through research on disadvantage, particularly cyclical deprivation. In addition, many recent reports, including last year's child deaths report and the national audit of neglect cases, have highlighted non-school attendance as a factor of and pointer to more serious child welfare concerns. Against this backdrop, I firmly believe that the inclusion of educational welfare services and school completion in the new child and family agency will lead to a greater collaborative approach in addressing issues of school completion, family support and child welfare. The nexus between school completion, family support and child welfare is critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> This Bill provides that all the functions and staff of the National Educational Welfare Board will transfer to the child and family agency on establishment. The merger will maintain a strong focus on educational welfare and providing support for schools in addressing educational welfare issues. The transfer of the NEWB will broaden the focus of the agency and its resources and tackle educational welfare as a key outcome for children in its own right and as a positive contributor to other outcomes. It will also assist in building very strong collaborative relationships between the agency and the education sector, in particular schools. I believe it is very important that the agency is a good partner to the schools who have so much contact with children.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> I am committed to ensuring the agency's educational welfare responsibilities, as set out in statute, have high visibility within the overall structure and that the close relationships with the education sector are maintained and strengthened. I have agreed with Government colleagues to explore the scope for further extending the child and family agency's responsibilities after it successfully commences operations. In any event, given the breadth of services provided to children, there will be an ongoing requirement for the agency to develop very strong partnerships with key agencies in the education, health, justice, local government and other sectors. Strong multi-agency working to promote children's outcomes is a challenge in all countries, the difficulty of which cannot be underestimated. My Department and the child and family agency will be to the fore in maintaining and improving linkages at operational and policy levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> I wish to comment on performance, accountability and transparency in relation to the new agency. The programme for Government commits to improving accountability. This reflects concern regarding the transparency and openness of the child welfare and protection services. The reform programme under way in HSE children and family services has already taken important initial steps to addressing this issue and bringing about the necessary cultural shift within these services. This programme is seeking to ensure greater service delivery consistency, role clarity and performance management, stronger partnerships with communities and voluntary agencies, and commitment to learning and openness, including through the review and public reporting of serious incidents. The recent introduction of Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards and inspection of child welfare and protection services also supports greater accountability and transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_946"> Considerable attention has been paid in the drafting of this Bill to achieving further improvement in accountability. The Bill will ensure there is a dedicated agency responsible for children's services reporting to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. It clarifies that the policy objectives for the agency will be set by the Minister, supported by the Department, and that the agency is responsible to the Minister for its performance. The task force on the child and family agency undertook a comprehensive review of governance models nationally and internationally and devised recommendations to assist in achieving good governance and accountability in the particular context applying to children's services and this agency. We have looked to that report for guidance. The proposed sections of this Bill reflect these recommendations, and a range of specific legislative proposals have been included to introduce a new model of public accountability and responsiveness on the part of the agency. This model includes control of the allocation of funding to the agency through the Vote of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in order that financial allocations are used to underpin Government priorities, performance targets and monitoring; the Minister specifying a multi-annual performance framework for the agency, which will set out key policy, resource and governance considerations, and the Minister issuing a performance statement to the agency each year, outlining for the coming year the priorities, resources and key Government targets applying.</p>
          <p eId="para_947"> The multi-annual performance framework and the annual performance statement will trigger a structured performance dialogue between the agency and the Department before submission by the agency of its multi-annual corporate plan and annual business plan. In other words, the agency will not set its own performance goals and objectives with the Minister a passive recipient. The Minister will articulate proactively the Government's requirements and enter into dialogue with the agency on how these can be achieved. These and other provisions of the Bill address the objectives identified in the programme for Government and the previous recommendations of the OECD to strengthen agency governance, performance accountability and transparency. They will also bring clarity to the roles, responsibilities and relationships between the Minister, the board and the executive. There has been much criticism in the past of this not being present in other agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"><b>
						</b>I wish to draw attention to the provisions in the Bill related to the best interests and views of the child. These provisions fully meet the wording put before the people last year in the referendum on children's rights and, I am happy to say, go beyond it in important respects. The specific requirements for the agency to perform its functions with regard to the Child Care Act 1991 and the Adoption Act 2010 accord with the provisions set out in the referendum on children's rights. The Bill contains additional requirements that cut across a broader range of functions relating to children and families. The agency will have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters and will ensure consideration is given to the views of children as part of any consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">I am happy that the Bill advances these important principles, which are at the core of how we deal with children and families. </p>
          <p eId="para_950"> I propose to outline to the House the key provisions of the Bill, which consists of 93 sections contained in 12 Parts and three Schedules. Part 1, consisting of sections 1 to 5, inclusive, provides for standard provisions grounding the legislation. Part 2, consisting of sections 6 to 18, inclusive, provides for the establishment of the Child and Family Agency and certain provisions relating to the furnishing of information and documentation. Part 3, consisting of sections 19 to 27, inclusive, provides for the composition, role and meetings of the board of the agency. Part 4, consisting of sections 28 to 35, inclusive, provides for the appointment, functions and obligations of the chief executive officer of the agency and the delegation of the functions of the CEO to employees and for their sub-delegation to or by other employees. Part 5, consisting of sections 36 to 40, inclusive, provides for the maintenance of proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest and relevant codes of conduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_951"> Part 6, consisting of sections 41 to 53, inclusive, relates to the theme of accountability to which I referred. Section 41 is to provide for the development of a performance framework by the Minister at specific times to inform the agency's corporate planning processes. It will provide the agency with policy guidance, direction and prioritisation parameters. Section 42 obliges the agency to prepare and submit to the Minister for approval a corporate plan which has regard to the performance framework provided by the Minister. Section 44 is to provide for the development of an annual performance statement. Section 46 provides for the submission of a business plan, an issue to which I have alluded. The other sections in this Part relate to financial matters, governance, reporting and the issuing of ministerial directions and guidelines. </p>
          <p eId="para_952"> Part 7, consisting of sections 53 to 55, inclusive, provides for the appointment of staff, advisers and consultants and matters relating to superannuation. Part 8, consisting of sections 56 to 59, inclusive, provides for the provision of services on behalf of the agency through arrangements with statutory and voluntary bodies. This will effectively guide the relationship the agency has with the voluntary providers it funds and which provide services to children and families. I expect there will be significant scope for greater co-operation and sharing of priorities with these voluntary bodies. </p>
          <p eId="para_953"> Part 9, consisting of sections 60 to 70, inclusive, provides for a complaints mechanism. Part 10 provides for the dissolution of the Family Support Agency and National Educational Welfare Board on establishment day. Section 72 is to provide for the transfer of specified functions from the Family Support Agency and the functions of the National Educational Welfare Board on establishment day to the Child and Family Agency. The remaining sections in this Part provide for the transfer of staff; the preservation of the terms and conditions of staff on establishment day; the transfer of property; the transfer of rights and liabilities entered into before establishment day pursuant to a contract, agreement or arrangement; the continuation in force of contracts, agreements or arrangements; the transfer of records; and the preparation of final accounts. </p>
          <p eId="para_954"><b>
						</b>Part 11, consisting of sections 82 to 90, inclusive, provides for the transfer of certain staff and functions from the Health Service Executive to the new agency. Section 83 provides for the designation by the Minister for Health, following consultation with the Minister, of staff to transfer to the agency on a day as may be specified by the Minister. It preserves, on that day, the terms and conditions of staff transferring, including tenure of office and remuneration and provides for the reckoning of previous service as service for the purpose of certain specified enactments. The remaining sections of this Part provide for the transfer of rights and liabilities entered into before establishment day pursuant to a contract, agreement or arrangement and the continuance in force of contracts, agreements or arrangements and transfer of records. Part 12, consisting of sections 91 to 93, inclusive, provides for standard miscellaneous legislative provisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_955"> Schedule 1 sets out the enactments under which functions are to transfer to the agency. Schedule 2 provides for matters related to consequential amendments. Schedule 3 provides for matters related to enactments being repealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> I thank Deputies who have signalled their support in principle for the new Child and Family Agency and look forward to our debate on the detailed legislation. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_333">
          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_957">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Second Stage debate on the Child and Family Agency Bill 2013. I am pleased to speak to the legislation and welcome its publication, which is long overdue. Having harassed the Minister for the past 12 months, its introduction to the House is welcome. As she is aware, it was due to be published before Christmas 2012 following the publication of the expert group report in July of that year. With Committee, Report and Final Stages to be completed and the Bill still to go before the Seanad, it is likely that it will not be enacted until later this year at the earliest. That said, I welcome its publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> The Minister regularly refers to the renewed emphasis and focus on children and their welfare and protection. It is true that attitudes to children have changed considerably. There was an old saying that children should be seen and not heard. Thankfully, society has changed in the past decade and members of the public and previous Governments have come to focus on children and child related issues. This change in focus has been incremental and substantial, not only in recent years, as the Minister would have us believe, but also in the past decade. </p>
          <p eId="para_959"> I will briefly refer to some of the important reforms of the previous decade. In 2000, the Government published the first national children's strategy. In 2004, the Office of Ombudsman for Children was established and the first Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, appointed. Ms Logan has since been reappointed by the Government. Unfortunately, the Ombudsman for Children is before the Joint Committee on Health and Children as we speak for a discussion on the new juvenile detention centre in Oberstown. I accept this clash of business is not the Minister's fault.</p>
          <p eId="para_960"> In 2006-07, the Government appointed the first independent Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon. This, too, was an important development. I read in newspaper reports over the weekend that Dr. Shannon has been reappointed to the position of rapporteur, which is an acknowledgement by the Minister of the significance of the original appointment by the previous Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> The previous Government also established the first Office of the Minister of State for Children and Youth Affairs. While I accept the office was not a full Department, it was none the less a significant improvement at the time and an acknowledgement of the role of children. It was from this office that the Minister's Department was formed, which was a positive development that my party welcomed and supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> Much of the groundwork for the referendum on children's rights was done by the previous Administration. I compliment the Minister on her drive and determination to ensure this work was not lost by continuing the work done by the former Minister of State, Mr. Barry Andrews. She ensured a referendum was put to the country and the result was a significant achievement which ensures the rights of children are enshrined in our Constitution. I am pleased with the role my party and many others played in this regard. It should also be noted that the CEO designate of the Child and Family Agency, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, was appointed by the previous Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_963"> The Minister referred to the neglect and gross abuse perpetrated on children while in the care of the State and in their parental homes. The Ryan and Murphy reports and the report of the review group on child deaths were compiled to shine a light on these grave injustices. Their findings identified the deficiencies in services and enabled corrective action and reform to be undertaken. As the Minister correctly noted, doing things differently requires us to proactively identify failures. One cannot fix what one cannot see. </p>
          <p eId="para_964"> I have provided some brief background details to demonstrate that reforms and a change in attitude were not confined to the past two years. This incremental and substantial process has been ongoing for the past decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> I now propose to address the provisions of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> I wish to speak on two critical sections, section 8 on the functions of the agency and section 9 on the agency having the best interests and views of the child in the performance of its functions. I am surprised that section 8 does not place a greater emphasis on supporting families. During the campaign on the children's rights referendum, the State's default position was that intervention was always the very last measure. During the course of that debate, the Minister, other Ministers and I often spoke of the need for enhanced family supports. Given recent comments on this I would have imagined this Bill would have placed greater emphasis - possibly even a separate section - on detailing how the Government would deal with the effective functioning of families.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> Section 8(3) refers to "supporting and encouraging the effective functioning of families". We all agree that the very best place for children to grow up is within a family. Yet, it is not clear how this Bill envisages the effective functioning of families. I am concerned over the absence of reference to parents and the fundamental role they play in children's lives. The Bill seems to predominately focus on State interventions with little practical reference to family support and early intervention, which take second place in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_968"> The child death report refers to the lack of availability of robust early intervention mechanisms. The Bill has little regard to the early intervention strategies which are critical to ensuring the long-term well-being of the children. I am disappointed with the lack of detailed description of how the new agency will deal with the effective functioning of families. I am disappointed with the scant nature of the reference to families, given the pivotal role they play in the welfare of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_969"> Given that the lack of a framework of interagency co-operation has featured in so many reports, such as the Ryan report and the Murphy report, I would have thought it would warrant its own section. Section 8(8) of the Bill states: "The Agency shall promote enhanced inter-agency co-operation to ensure that services for children are co-ordinated and provide an integrated response to the needs of children and their families." That is bland waffle. It does not give a detailed framework of how the various agencies will deal with one another. On Monday night while driving home, I heard a repeat of the Newstalk lunchtime show on which the Minister spoke. She reiterated the importance of multidisciplinary teams and the need for a co-ordinated interagency approach. It is extremely disappointing to see the bland, undetailed, non-specific subsection on interagency co-operation. I remind the Minister of some of the horrific reports on the malpractices, deficiencies and the inadequacies of State care over the years, all of which highlighted the consequences of failing to have robust interagency co-operation. This legislation does not alleviate that when it clearly fails to define exactly interagency co-operation and how agencies will share information.</p>
          <p eId="para_970"> Given the relevance of the Children First legislation to the establishment of this agency, I would have expected the Minister to have fulfilled her promise and published this legislation so that they could be considered in tandem. Even though it is not published, I am surprised that there is no reference in this legislation to interagency co-operation and the implementation of the Children First legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_971"> I turn to areas not under the remit of this legislation but which are critical to child welfare and well-being for which a detailed interagency agreement is also important. It is regrettable that the child and adolescent mental health services will not be under the remit of the new agency, despite the fact that the expert task force the Minister established recommended it should be. On publication of this expert report, the Minister acknowledged the need for this area to come under the remit of this legislation. Children end up in care as a result of mental health issues, alcohol abuse or poverty, as the Minister mentioned in her contribution. However, mental health remains outside the scope of the legislation. Why has the Minister departed from the recommendations of the expert group that she established? Failure to address mental health issues at an early stage can have a profound impact on children. The child death report highlighted the devastating consequences for many children who failed to be identified as having mental health issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> While I accept the Minister's desire to have this critical area brought under the remit of the new agency, is there some sort of turf war going on between her and the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch? It should not be Department fighting Department. It is about finding the best solutions for children and families. In her interview on Monday the Minister spoke about the Government needing to lead and it should do so. However, I am concerned that this area has not come under the remit of this new agency and not only because of the lack of detailed framework for interagency co-operation. Yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that €35 million ring-fenced for community mental health services in 2013 might be gobbled up into the overall HSE budget. That comes on top of the failure to spend the entire €35 million allocation for 2012. I would have much more confidence if this area was addressed in this legislation. Why has this not happened despite the fact that there has been a delay in publication of the legislation? Timing should not have been an issue. In her reply I ask the Minister to outline why this did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> I take the opportunity to say that public health nurses are doing outstanding work. They provide a key role in child protection. They are often the first people to pick up on the early indicators of neglect and yet they are not coming under the remit of this agency. While I can accept there is a divergence of opinion on whether they should come under its remit, legislation should contain a detailed definition of the role they will play within this new agency. The important role they play should be recognised in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> While the Bill focuses on the operational aspects of this new agency, it lacks vision. This is not and nor should it be about simply changing the name and joining together a number of agencies - or rationalisation of services as the Government likes to call it. This should be about changing the culture and formulating a vision. The Bill should clearly state what the new agency stands for. As I mentioned already, there is no reference to parents and there is scant reference to children, despite these two being the pillars of what the legislation is all about. Section 9 refers to the best interests of the child. However, it merely refers to the best interests of the child in child care and adoption proceedings. In last November's constitutional referendum, the people decided children's views should be visible in all matters as per Article 42A.1.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">This view is shared by the Children's Rights Alliance. I only received its analysis of the legislation recently but from reading through it quickly this point stuck out. People from the alliance are concerned about the best interests of the child in the context of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> I wish to raise the issue of governance and governance structures and, in particular, the role of the Minister, the board and the chief executive. Part 3 deals with the functions of the board and Part 4 deals with the functions of the chief executive. I raised this matter during the briefing session but I am none the wiser now and no explanatory note has made its way to my office. It appears that there is no direct line of accountability. What happens when a future crisis arises within the sector? Who will be held accountable? Will it be the board, the Minister or the Executive?</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> Section 47 gives the Minister of the day the power to issue directions and guidelines to the agency. What happens if the board fails to implement these directions and guidelines? As the democratically elected person, the Minister of the day, regardless of who he or she is, must have a mechanism to ensure implementation but I see nothing of that in the Bill. People wish to see clear lines of accountability and transparency. Such measures can bring about confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> I wish to discuss the composition of the board. No one will question the qualification, suitability or expertise of the new chairperson of the board, Norah Gibbons. However, people question why there was no advertisement for the position. If the Government is serious about openness and transparency, there must be advertisements for future positions on the board. The board should have a mixed composition of professional personnel, including psychologists and people with a family support background as well as people with relevant work experience. These positions should be advertised and expressions of interest should be sought from the public. All of this is in the interests of confidence, openness and transparency. Appointments should not be seen purely as rewards for political supporters.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> Section 59 deals with assistance for voluntary bodies. I compliment the work voluntary bodies do in the area of child protection and advocating children's rights. The carry out superb work and they played a pivotal role in ensuring the passage of the children's rights referendum last year. Non-governmental organisations, including the Children's Right Alliance, the ISPCC, Barnardos, Focus Ireland, Empowering Young People in Care, EPIC, and others play pivotal roles in the provision of child protection services and in advocating children's rights. While Section 9 envisages the assistance of voluntary bodies in the delivery of child protection services it does not stipulate by what means exactly and how they will assist. There are in excess of 90 agencies working in the area of child protection and welfare. Therefore, we should have an open and transparent mechanism for selecting a particular agency for the delivery of a service. I understand that in Australia one third of child protection work is dealt with by NGOs. Earlier, I referred to the need for a clear framework to deal with the agencies. Equally, there should be a clear framework for dealing with NGOs. Such a framework would instill confidence and remove any suspicion that one NGO could be favoured over another.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> Section 64 deals with complaints and review procedures. Now is the time, when we are formulating this new agency, to extend the remit of HIQA. HIQA should be responsible for dealing with all child-related services. There is a need for an independent watchdog and I believe HIQA would instill public confidence in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> Unfortunately, only recently we saw the consequences of poor inspections. This was despite the fact that in 2009 the previous Government amended regulations to include section 5 to ensure the well-being of children. Despite this amendment, several months ago we witnessed horrific scenes of blatant neglect and physical and emotional abuse of children in our crèches. It is horrific to think that one of the crèches identified in the programme had passed an inspection in the previous weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> Unfortunately this is not a legacy issue, as the Minister has said previously, but a contemporary issue of here and now. Now, in the aspect of formulating this legislation for the new agency, is an ideal opportunity to ensure that we expand the remit of HIQA and put in place an independent watchdog that will instill and renew public confidence in our crèches and child care facilities. The parents of Ireland deserve that much but so do the many good quality loving and caring people who work in these facilities. They too deserve to have the air of suspicion surrounding their sector removed. The establishment of an independent quality watchdog such as HIQA would ensure that much.</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> The budget deficit is a matter of concern. Will the Minister confirm whether the new agency will carry over the legacy budget? I acknowledge that the Minister has succeeded in securing a slight reduction in the overall deficit. However, what a statement of seriousness it would represent if the Minister could declare that the agency would start off from a fresh sheet with no overhang or budget deficit. That would send out a magnificent statement of confidence and seriousness in the agency. Unless the agency is adequately resourced then it will not function properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> The Minister has alluded to the 4,000 staff who are moving across and who will become part of the staff in the agency. I have asked about it before, but is the Minister confident that we will have the required number of competent staff working in front-line services to ensure the provision of critical child welfare, child protection and supports? Is the Minister confident that we will have the full complement of staff?</p>
          <p eId="para_985"> At the time of the children's rights referendum I said that the amendment would only be an aspiration if it was not backed up with the necessary reserves. We are keen for the agency to succeed and we are supporting the Minister in its establishment but it will not succeed unless it is backed up with the necessary resources and supports and staffed with the appropriate competent people on the front line. I realise the Minister has secured permission from her colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to hire the people in the leadership roles. Leadership roles are important but so too are the people who will be on the ground working and serving the people they are meant to serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> We should reflect on how the National Educational Welfare Board has functioned in the past and its shortcomings before it is assumed into the new agency. We need to ask why truancy is a consistent problem and what initiatives are being taken to promote school attendance. The Bill fails to link education with the outcomes for children. Truancy happens for various reasons and we need to examine these reasons. One reason is a failure to identify special needs within children until it is too late or until children have fallen out or dropped out of school. For example, dyslexia is going undiagnosed and there is nothing in the Bill to ensure that this is not tackled. There is nothing in the Bill to ensure adequate training is provided to the new people who will be responsible for ensuring that our children remain in education. The Bill merely transfers the National Educational Welfare Board without any amendment to reflect deficiencies in the system as it stands.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">This is wrong and is a matter Members might consider at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> In conclusion, I again thank the Minister for bringing this long-overdue legislation before the Dáil. It is complex legislation and while it was only published last Friday, I look forward to studying it over the summer with a view to ascertaining how improvements might be tabled and made on later Stages. This legislation is 76 pages in length and is comprised of 96 sections and considering its length and level of detail, I am disappointed with the lack of emphasis on children and parents and the strong emphasis the Minister has chosen to place on technical issues. This legislation and the establishment of this agency must be about the best possible outcomes for children. This Bill must ensure there are clear and definitive lines of accountability. This legislation provides a unique opportunity to correct and improve those areas and deficiencies that have been identified by various reports in recent years. Moreover, this agency offers a unique opportunity to ensure Ireland has a family support system, a child welfare system and a child protection system that are not merely among the best in the world but are world leaders. I pledge to work constructively with the Minister on this Bill to ensure this objective is realised. In recent months, I have produced three draft legislative items to try to help the Minister to build that world-class service of which we all can be proud. I look forward to coming back to the debate on subsequent Stages to ensure Members capitalise on this unique opportunity and embrace the challenges that lie ahead. As the Minister noted in her contribution on Newstalk on Monday and earlier today, the Government and political representatives must lead from the front to ensure the best interests and welfare of children and families are of paramount concern and that is what this Bill should address.</p>

          <p eId="para_990">Yes, I am sharing time with Deputy McLellan. I apologise to the Minister for missing the opening lines of her contribution. The Second Stage was reached much quicker than I had anticipated this afternoon. I was not only finalising my own contribution but was preparing for the Joint Committee on Health and Children and, as Deputy Troy already has noted, a discussion with the Ombudsman for Children in respect of child detention centres. I send my apologies for being unable to attend to Deputy Buttimer and the other members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, as well as to Ms Logan.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> I welcome this Bill and the establishment of the child and family agency. Sinn Féin Members have long campaigned and called for it here in the Oireachtas over recent years. Sinn Féin welcomed the appointment of a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in the form of Deputy Fitzgerald, and the establishment of the new Department. It was an important decision of the new Government early in its term and was something for which Sinn Féin also had long called and advocated. In a referendum last year, the people endorsed a constitutional amendment strengthening the rights of children. At the time, I stated it must be followed up by robust legislation and by the allocation of the resources needed to vindicate children’s rights. This Bill is a step forward although I believe there is a very long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_992"> While the appointment of the Minister and the establishment of the Department arguably came at the worst possible time economically, it also could be argued that in economically harsh times, greater protection and enhanced representation for children is needed more than ever. I take that latter view and precisely the same point applies to the agency established by this Bill. In that context, the allocation of a budget of €439 million to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2013 is modest to say the least, albeit an increase on 2012. As one continues to consider the implications of the Anglo Irish Bank tapes, one contrasts the tens of billions of euro of public money shovelled into that cesspit with the less than half a billion euro allocated this year to the Department responsible for the children of Ireland. One of the smallest allocations in the Revised Estimates for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which was dealt with at the select sub-committee last week, is a €2.5 million State contribution for the area-based response to child poverty. I note the Minister stated the bulk of the funding for this programme, €29 million, comes from Atlantic Philanthropies. This covers just three disadvantaged areas in this State and the Minister hopes another three will be added next year. It must be stated there is a bitter irony in this, as one has the Government topping up a grant from an international charity to address child poverty in this State, while the Government itself, through its futile austerity policies, is increasing child poverty. This is an indisputable fact, as I need only point to the cut to child benefit, which represents the single worst assault in many years on the incomes of families with children and which hits low to middle-income families worst of all. Moreover, this was in the wake of the children’s referendum. While a total of €2.5 million is going to a handful of areas to address child poverty, in budget 2013 a full-year cut of €142 million was made to child benefit and Members should stop to think about the contrast between these two figures. This was a reduction in child benefit, which is the most direct and beneficial payment to families and children in poverty or in danger of poverty. This is what child benefit has been and has meant to so many struggling families, both in present times and in years past. I have no doubt that this single cut has pushed many more families into poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> Although the Minister’s Department is not directly responsible for that particular cut, she is part of the Government that imposed it and that cut, regrettably, together with all the other cuts affecting families and children, is undermining the positive work, which I unhesitatingly acknowledge, and the future plans of her Department, including the plans for the child and family agency. While the explanatory memorandum states that the new agency on its establishment will assume responsibility for child welfare and protection, including the services relating to the psychological welfare of children and must consult with children and “hear and take into account” the child’s views in certain matters, it does not require that the new agency listen to and take into account the views of children in all matters pertaining to their lives and welfare. This is something I had understood to have been established clearly, certainly in the spirit if not the letter on foot of the children's referendum. I believe the Minister should strengthen the commitment in this legislation on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> The new child and family agency was of course initially intended to be called the child and family support agency. I have raised the matter of the dropping of the word "support" from the title of the new body previously but the Minister has not adequately replied to my questions as to the reason the word "support" has been dropped. I am in no way assured there is not an ulterior reason for so doing. In replying to Second Stage contributions, will the Minister care to expand on whatever she already has said on this matter? The Family Support Agency has heretofore been a key player in addressing and providing for the address of a range of challenges that present in the lives of families and whole communities. It had a board that included representation from the Family Resource Centre National Forum and again, despite repeated questioning by this Deputy, the Minister has avoided clarity on the make-up of the interim or transition board and the board of the new child and family agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">Will the Minister explain the reasons for the disbandment of the Family Support Agency board and why she has not appointed an interim board in the time since then, although she has appointed Ms Norah Gibbons chairperson designate, a welcome appointment? How fewer will its number be, as opposed to the previous Family Support Agency board? Again, will the Family Resource Centre National Forum have direct representation on the new child and family agency board and if not, why not? Whether the Minister is fully aware of it, there is considerable concern among those involved across the network of family resource centres that without that critical representation, their character, ethos and long-established focus will be placed at risk. Surely the access that has served the sector so well heretofore should be maintained. The Family Resource Centre National Forum should have board representation on the new agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> There is also serious concern regarding current child protection services and the real position relating to social worker numbers. The Minister was at pains over several months last year and earlier this year to assure the House that the promised recruitment had been progressed and, if not complete, was nearly completed. However, we learn from the recently published report, prepared last year by Lynne Peyton and which addressed the child protection services in Roscommon, Waterford and south-east Dublin, that in 96 cases brought to the attention of the HSE child protection services, less than half were adequately addressed. As the report states: "There were many families in which the circumstances for children did not improve despite the involvement of statutory services." It also states that "parental resistance to change and non compliance with child protection plans was not adequately challenged" in a number of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_997"> The incredible bottom line is that inclusion on the child protection notification system did not necessarily mean that the child's circumstances had or would improve. Does that position still hold? The report states that this appears to be due to "a lack of understanding of the harsh reality of everyday life for children, the cumulative long-term consequences of neglect, a cultural commitment to keeping families together at all costs and a perceived reticence by the Courts to grant Care Orders in neglect scenarios". In responding to the report's findings, the HSE said there was a need to be alert to the systemic and ongoing impact of neglect. It said that reform of child and family services was ongoing and that it included enhanced governance systems, improved workforce development and the standardisation of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> I would never hold the Minister solely responsible in the area of child protection services and for provision in the interests of the rights of children, so how can we collectively address the serious lack of public confidence in our child protection services, which I encounter occasionally, when such reports and such inadequate responses are the order of the day? This is not a historical matter but is more contemporary than we would wish. Surely the child protection services in transition and under the oversight of the designated chief executive of the new child and family agency would, on foot of all that has been revealed in a succession of reports and exposés over recent years, be advanced to a better and more fit for purpose status. It is understandable that, sadly, some have concluded that nothing has changed and little will change in reality. I hope that will not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> Despite the fact that I am supportive of the establishment of the new agency and remain supportive of the Minister's programme of work, which I acknowledge and for which I admire her, I am hugely concerned that without the necessary funding and resourcing, including the required human resources, the new agency will continue to fail some children, families and communities. Without the required funding and staffing provision, the new agency will fail to meet the Minister's hopes and my hopes for it and will fail the many people who really need it to be a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> I will support the passing of the Bill and I will address some aspects of it on Committee and Report Stages. I invite the Minister also to give it her further consideration to ensure what we finally arrive at, when we will hopefully see its successful passage through this House, will indeed be everything we would wish.</p>

        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1001">The debate on the way children are treated in society has moved to centre stage in recent times, which is a welcome development. I believe we have become increasingly conscious of the fact that many children in our society were neglected, abused and forgotten. The evidence placed before us in the Ryan, Monageer, Ferns and Roscommon child care inquiry reports as well as the report of the child death independent review group underlines the fact that this is not a misplaced concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> The stories from the various reports, which all had different although overlapping subject matters, shocked the nation and caused us to ask how it happened and how it was allowed to happen. No mother or father could help but think of their own child as we heard of the dreadful physical, sexual and emotional abuse so many young people suffered at the hands of clerical orders and others. None of us could help but be horrified as we heard how the State was made aware of threats to the health, welfare and lives of children but failed to do anything. It is truly heartbreaking to think of the lonely and tragic way in which a number of young people lost their lives while in care, as highlighted by the child death independent review group. It is clear that the way many children were treated in this country, and in particular the way in which the State safeguarded and protected the welfare of these children, was extremely deficient. There was clearly a need for action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> It is against that background and that failure that this legislation is being brought forward, and we will be pleased to give the Bill our support. It marks a significant step forward in terms of the protection of the health and welfare of children. The Child and Family Agency Bill will establish, for the first time, a dedicated support agency for children and families under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. The agency will bring together the HSE children and family services, the Family Support Agency, the National Educational Welfare Board and services relating to the psychological welfare of children as well as domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The need for such an agency has been clear for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> This has come about on foot of considerable campaigning work from a wide variety of bodies and organisations. Most political parties have been supportive of it for some time, including Sinn Féin. There has long been concern about the lack of co-ordination between the various agencies responsible for children's welfare, and that this was leading to a deficit in information sharing and a lack of joined-up approaches to issues or cases that may have required a cross-departmental or cross-agency response. The need for a single authority with responsibility for this area was flagged as early as 1993 in the report on the Kilkenny incest case. Barnardos put it well when it said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1005">Services for children and families in Ireland have long been divided across political departmental lines, particularly at the national level. On the ground, services have developed in an ad hoc manner, responding to local needs without a comprehensive national framework that helps to join the dots between the myriad services children and families engage with across Ireland. The division of services which often target many of the same children and families has led to fragmented service provision which fails to put the child at the centre of its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> There was an obvious need to establish an agency of this kind to ensure there will be a very clear line of responsibility in respect of these matters. I, therefore, commend the Minister on establishing this new agency and on this legislation, both of which constitute a welcome and important step forward. The Minister has made progress on a number of important issues and I also commend her on that. There is a new Department and Ministry and the referendum on children's rights has been passed. All of these are extremely important developments. However, considerable shortfalls remain in this area and these must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> The most obvious and outstanding concern that is held across the youth care sector relates to resources. While this matter has been discussed on numerous occasions in the House, the conversation relating to it must be repeated until such time as it registers with the Government. The best structures and policies and the finest social and youth workers in the world will not have the impact envisaged if adequate staff and other resources are not put in place. If there is too great a workload on too few people, it will result in mistakes being made, oversights and children being failed. I recognise that some new social workers have been appointed. However, the numbers taken on are nowhere near sufficient. Ireland has relatively few child protection workers per head of population and in the context of the total number of children in care. Many of the reports compiled in respect of this matter have highlighted that levels of staffing are not adequate. In July 2013, a review of the management of neglect cases in three areas of the country found that in Roscommon, the social work team was, at times, "dangerously understaffed". There were also very long delays for access to psychology services relating to child protection assessments, with 180 children obliged to wait one to two years to be assessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008"> We can expect an increase in demand. The HSE's figures show that demand for its children and family services is increasing due to the increase in the number of children in the State, the economic climate and the consequent increase in reporting. When the Children First guidelines are placed on a statutory footing, we can expect further increases. Notwithstanding the increased staffing levels, both IMPACT and the Irish Association for Social Workers have expressed concerns about the level of vacancies, including those created by maternity leave, in this female-dominated profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> It is clear that the recruitment embargo is still having a detrimental effect on staffing levels. I am greatly concerned with regard to how this will impact on the implementation of this legislation. As well as matters relating to staffing, the issue of finance also arises. The Children's Rights Alliance has argued that for the agency to be successful, it must start life without the deficit - approximately €20 million - currently carried by the HSE child and family services. The new agency will take over the responsibilities of the National Educational Welfare Board, which is extremely appropriate, particularly as it is germane to and tied in with wider issues of child protection and welfare. Ensuring a child obtains a good education and has access to the same educational opportunities as his or her peers is the best way to ensure he or she can live well, be happy and achieve his or her full potential. This is a key duty the new agency will be taking on. The National Educational Welfare Board has been criticised in recent times for its failure to take action and ensure children are attending school. Behaviour such as avoiding or missing school can often go hand in hand with other welfare difficulties. It is essential, therefore, that a joined-up approach is taken. We hope the new agency will have a different focus on welfare than the National Educational Welfare Board. It is vital that it should place a high priority on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> One area which must be addressed in terms of children's welfare is that which relates to children in direct provision. I have just left a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children at which the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, discussed detention in the context of St Patrick's Institution and other institutions. As far as I am concerned, however, direct provision is merely another form of detention. The Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, recently warned that Ireland's treatment of asylum seekers "may well be in breach of not just our own Constitution but also international human rights conventions". She referred to a case with which her office dealt and which "showed the failure of State agencies to uphold their own obligations in relation to an asylum-seeking mother and her two young daughters". She said that what happened "effectively sundered that family unit". Under the current asylum process, an entire early childhood can be spent in direct provision accommodation. Almost a third of asylum seekers are children. They have no autonomy or liberty and in my opinion they could certainly be considered to be in detention. These places are not remotely suitable for children. Progress has been very slow on the legislation to reform the area. I hope the new agency and the Minister will take responsibility for safeguarding these children and ensuring their welfare - as they would in the case of other children - and take whatever steps are necessary to vindicate their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> I welcome this positive Bill and I commend the Minister on introducing it. However, I again emphasise that structures and policies are only able to deliver in light of the number of staff and level of resources available to them. I hope the Minister will take that fact on board.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_337">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1012">I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on the work she has done in respect of getting it to this point. Everyone believes it is long overdue. In principle, I support the Bill but I am aware that amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage. I hope these will be accepted in the spirit in which they will be advanced and that they may result in some changes being made to the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> The purpose of the Bill is to amalgamate a number of existing agencies, namely, the HSE child protection and welfare services, the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board. The new agency that will result will have quite a large staff of some 4,000 and a budget of €500 million. However, these are not new staff and this is not new money. Both are being transferred. It is important the new agency should begin life debt free. It would be a wrong signal to send if that were not the case. In such circumstances, the deficit should not be transferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> I was a member of the Commission on the Family which was established in the wake of the successful referendum on divorce and which sat for a couple of years. At that time, the Department of Social Protection was known as the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I was very upset when the family affairs aspect was lost because the Department to which I refer was the only one which had any kind of focus on family over the years. The Commission on the Family examined the position of families in which problems might arise but it also considered developing good policy around supports for families. I hope the new agency will have a similar dual function and that it will consider the type of policy we should be adopting as best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> The purpose of the agency will be to support and encourage the effective functioning of families, provide psychological services for children and families - a very welcome development - and offer care and protection to the victims of domestic, sexual or gender-based violence. A new refuge - it will be the only one in the area - is due to open in south Kildare quite soon. A great deal of money was spent on developing this refuge, which is an extremely good facility. I wonder about the kind of supports which are put in place in facilities of that nature in the context of how children are treated. I am concerned that the refuge will be seen as a temporary place in which to put people while they are at risk, rather than being perceived in a much more holistic way. It must be recognised and understood that the women and children who end up in such refuges are very traumatised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">It is a very good example of design and the ethos is very good but it must also be resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> An overriding principle of the Bill places the best interests and views of the child at the centre of decision making. An annual report on the agency's functioning will be required and it will be presented to the Minister and laid before the Oireachtas. Is it intended that this will be one step removed from oversight here? Will it be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas or will the Minister be directly responsible for the agency in terms responding to parliamentary questions, or will there be a separation as applies in respect of the HSE, which I consider to be a big negative?</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> The agency will be obliged to furnish the relevant policy information to the Minister. I presume, if that is in the public interest, there will be a role for the Oireachtas committee in that respect also. If we are to believe what we are being told, the committees will be examined as a vehicle for generating legislation, and that would be an important development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> The agency will be governed by a nine-person board. I like the idea of the term limits that will apply. That will allow for bringing in fresh ideas and at the same time there will not be a loss of experience. I note that expressions of interest have already been sought for candidates. I welcome the involvement of Norah Gibbons. I do not think anyone could doubt that she is incredibly expert in this area and has done some extremely good work in very difficult situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> It is important that there will be a facility for complaints to be lodged to the agency. For too long as a State when a child needed care or refuge we handed that provision over to someone else. It might be something that stems from colonialism, namely, we have a difficulty with power, taking power and using it but we did so right from the formation of the State. We have seen some disastrous results as a consequence. What is welcome about this Bill is that it is the State taking responsibility. There may well be flaws in it and it comes down, as has been said, to having the resources to back it up, but at least that is the intent. The intent to act in the child's best interest is incredibly important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> We all agree that most families function well and many will never need to have recourse to an agency such as this, apart from the policy formation side of it. Other families do not function well and require intervention. As a public representative I have found it incredibly frustrating over the years to try to find solutions where I know that a more co-ordinated solution is required. Having all the services available under one roof is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> In many ways we have abrogated our responsibility to children. We have approached child care services in a piecemeal, <i>ad hoc</i> and fragmented way and, as a result, children have suffered. I need point no further than to the report of the Independent Child Death Review Group for a harrowing example of our collective failure of children. If one has a bad process, one will get a bad outcome. It is important that we get the process right and the legislation sets that down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> In that context, I welcome the Bill and what it aims to achieve. I recognise it as the biggest and probably the first real attempt to restructure children's services in the history of the State. It is not that many decades ago that the view prevailed that little children should be seen but not heard. That was a terribly dangerous approach to child welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> I have a few comments to make on some of the proposals in the Bill. I wish to comment on the type of institutional culture that will be needed if the child and family agency is to succeed in its aims. This is a vital element. The new agency must put the child at the centre of all decision-making and operations. That is a key element that has been missing in our existing fractured approach. We have to get that right from the start. That should dominate the thinking of the new agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025"> The Children's Rights Alliance submitted a very useful contribution, as has Barnardos. The Children's Rights Alliance requires that not only the views of the child be ascertained but that they are given due weight. That is important. It is not only a question of listening but of listening and acting. Barnardos agrees that the existing wording should be strengthened. This could be achieved to copperfasten the type of ethos that we want. The Children's Rights Alliance also recommends a specific subsection guaranteeing the principle of non-discrimination in the operation of the agency. Deputy McLellan drew attention to the need for that. That would be a very worthwhile amendment to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026"> Provision of the necessary resources and inter-agency co-operation are critical. That principle does not apply only to the ethos of the new agency. Laws are fairly useless unless provision to implement them is adequately resourced, particularly when the delivering of a service is involved. We must make them a reality and one does that by having people with the right ethos and the right range of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> The Minister will agree that we need to see concrete resources and support offered to the new body, a task that will be difficult given the current state of our public finances. There is a mismatch in the staffing and in terms of the 4,000 staff the Minister mentioned, their distribution can be variable throughout the country and the expertise within the new agency may not be based in the right location. I would like to hear the Minister's view on the way that can be remedied. Is the Minister having discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform regarding that?</p>
          <p eId="para_1028"> Section 8 lays out specific requirements on the new agencies to promote inter-agency co-operation, which is critical to the successful functioning of the new agency. We need to see how the new agency will co-operate and the way it will do so in the best interests of a child. Has a regulatory impact assessment been done, for example, in regard to this legislation? There is not a Member who does not know of individual cases to which we can draw attention on which three, four or five different actions are required. We need to know the way that co-operation will function before the new agency commences its work. I never want to see this State having to make more apologies. We must anticipate that to ensure we do not end up doing that. We do not want to find ourselves in that position 20 years from now. We have got to get this right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029"> As a Deputy I am very familiar with parents contacting me having reached the end of their tether in trying to access State services for their children. It is often a child with a special need and not something that will necessarily be part of the remit of this agency. They often come to me with a big folder under their arm. Such parents find themselves in a situation where they have to be the advocate for the child on a daily basis to try to eke out the services and supports that should be in place for them. Our clientelist political system would not function if we had functioning public institutions. That is the reason it is important to get this right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">In this regard I certainly do not want to be a middle woman. We know about the role played by the middle man and the middle woman in the operation of this kind of politics. I think people should be able to access the services they need for themselves. I know the Minister, like me, will have seen the stress endured by families. I do not know if the new body will have a function beyond where there are special needs. I would welcome what the Minister has to say in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031"> Barnardos has made the point that parents should be active agents rather than passive recipients of services. Their role needs to be recognised. Parents are trying to do their best for their children. I have had parents in my constituency office telling me that their ten, 11 or 12 year old is going to end up in prison. It is not the case that the parents in question have not tried their best to do something. They are struggling to access interventions to assist children who are out of control, have serious behavioural problems and have not received the early interventions they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> Barnardos has recommended that a definition of "the child" should be included in the legislation. I think this is a sensible approach. During the Second Stage debate on the Bill that was introduced last year to provide for the children's rights referendum, there were calls to define what is meant by "the child". I did not support the definition that was proposed at the time because I thought it was overly narrow and I did not think it would be correctly positioned if it were included in the Constitution. It could be argued that this legislation is the correct place in which to include such a definition. I would welcome the inclusion of a definition to remedy this omission from the Bill. I am aware that this point has been made by Barnardos and the Children's Rights Alliance as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> The referendum obviously placed the best interests of the child at the core of our approach in this area. Section 9 goes a long way towards enshrining that principle in law. However, it has been argued by Barnardos and the Children's Rights Alliance that this could be strengthened. I would like to hear the views of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> I believe there could be a greater focus on early intervention, about which I have spoken previously. We all know that better outcomes are achieved when intervention takes place at an early stage. Early intervention is good for the child, the families and the State. The cost over a person's lifetime of locking him or her up when he or she is young and trying to undo that damage at a later stage is far greater than the cost of the kind of investment in early intervention that we would all like. There is no reference in the Bill to the remit of the agency with regard to early intervention. I would like to know what is planned in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035"> The new agency will have a large staff complement. I believe the 4,000 workers in question are unfairly distributed around the country. In many cases, it is a case of lottery by postcode. It depends on who was there at the time. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on this critically important matter. The area I represent has one of the highest birth rates in the country. Some €20 million was supposed to be allocated last year for the provision of therapy services, but that did not happen and it was pushed into this year. We are a good way into the year, but most of the services have not yet been provided. It is likely that the entire €20 million will not be spent - some of it will be sucked back into the HSE budget. We are postponing the provision of critical services that children need. We will pay a price for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> There is no mention in the Bill of an express entitlement to aftercare services. Barnardos has pointed out that such services are vital if children are to make a successful transition to the adult world. We owe it to children who have been in this framework for most if not all of their lives to help them to make this transition. I would like to know where this element of the service fits into the new structure. What is the Minister thinking in this respect? I do not doubt that many amendments will be tabled on Committee Stage. Although I am not a member of the relevant committee, I might propose a few amendments in due course. We can all say we have an investment in families and in child welfare because we all function in such environments. I would be surprised if amendments are not tabled from many quarters, including those who are not on the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_1039">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Child and Family Agency Bill 2013. Having been present for most of the debate so far, I believe we have had a constructive engagement to date. I want to begin by commending and congratulating the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on getting to this point after undertaking a large body of work. We are finally at the point where we can establish a stand-alone agency that is concerned with the welfare of children and families. As Deputies on all sides of the House have recognised, this is a major step forward. Up to this point, we have had 4,000 staff scattered across the sector, but now we will have an interagency approach. This is the first time, with the exception of section 20 of the Child Care Act 2007, that we are taking an interagency approach and mentioning the word "interagency" in our Statute Book. That is a positive reflection on the work that has been done by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> Under this Bill, child welfare and child protection will no longer have to play second fiddle to hospital trolley counts. It will be more than a small cog in the large and complex wheel that is the Irish health service. This change is right and proper. It is badly needed. The needs of children are complex, as are the needs of families. In fact, life is complex. Having a stand-alone agency to deal with child-related services recognises these complexities. It will allow for the delivery of effective services, a much more thorough and focused analysis and a more accountable delivery of services. Irish children deserve no less.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> As we take this step forward, it is important for us to remember how we arrived at this point. It can be uncomfortable for people in politics, in civic society and in religious institutions to do so, but it is vital that we do not forget what happened in previous years. The Kilkenny incest report was published in 1993. The report of the review panel on the west of Ireland farmer case was published in 1998. The Ferns report was published in 2005. The Monageer inquiry report was published in 2008. The report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was published in 2009. The Roscommon child care inquiry report was published in 2010. Most recently, the report of the Independent Child Death Review Group 2012 was published in 2012. That is where we are coming from. These reports and reviews, independently and collectively, read as a litany of failure, silence and, at times, cover-up. They are a reflection of an Irish society that valued authority and establishment more than children, and preferred living a quiet life to taking action. Until this Ireland is confined to history, as it must be, our Republic will not have come of age. All of us in this House and in civic society - leaders in all walks of life - are responsible for achieving this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> It is worth noting during this debate that many of those who have used their pulpit to condemn and decry elected representatives of this House in recent weeks, in the context of the protection of life legislation, failed to use that same medium to anything like the same degree to condemn and denounce a society that failed to protect children, to speak out and to safeguard the innocence and vulnerability of a child's life. In recent days, we have seen these failures continue, with religious orders playing the poor mouth and refusing to put their hands in the pockets of their institutions in order to support the victims and, in so doing, acknowledge the failings of the past and show dignity to the women who saw their youth curtailed, damaged and effectively ended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> The State, sadly, is also approaching the issue of child welfare with a long and shameful legacy of letting children down. The Government is determined to right that wrong. That is why we have a new Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Huge work has been done. The Minister successfully steered last year's children's rights referendum, which enshrined those rights on our Constitution for the first time. The legislation that is being introduced in this Chamber today will establish a stand-alone agency for children and families. This target-driven and child-focused agency will be built on accountability. The Bill is so significant that stakeholders have correctly described it as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fundamentally change and improve services for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> As the Minister pointed out, this is part of a much broader suite of developments relating to child welfare. I note that Deputy Troy is no longer in the House. He is an individual I respect but I find it rather amusing that every time the Minister tries to do something, it is delayed or long overdue in the eyes of Deputy Troy. It has only become long overdue since we came into office and since the previous Government left. These are issues that have been hanging around for years. The only thing the Minister's critics could possibly accuse her of being is overly ambitious. Another point worth making is that as we shine a light on this area, which has been left in darkness and ignored in large part by the Government and by civic society, it is understandable that we will uncover more things that make us uncomfortable but that is a sign of the Minister's success. </p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> In respect of the points made by Deputy Ó Caoláin, he is very committed to this area but I would hate to see this issue boiled down to resources. We saw how during the Celtic tiger, money was thrown around like snuff at a wake but these issues were still not dealt with. Resources are important but there is a need for structural reform and to ensure that money is allocated within a structure that will deliver. </p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> I wish to add my voice to Deputy Catherine Murphy's question about parliamentary questions. The way the establishment of the HSE removed political accountability and debate from our health service has been an unmitigated disaster. I am not sure whether it is the case but I ask for it to be made clear that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will continue to take parliamentary questions concerning issues under the agency's new remit. If that is not the case, it should be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> The Minister has already outlined the provisions of this Bill and has obviously established how it is a framework for future development. I wish to put on the record of the House that some of the observations of the task force concern areas the Bill does not include. I know these areas go beyond the Minister's brief and must be looked at by all of Government when this agency is established. I am quite worried by the task force report's opinion that the implications of not including the child and adolescent mental health services in the agency is that "mental health services will fail to meet the holistic needs of children and young people". We then look at the situation of public health nursing which we are told will continue to take a back seat to other demands. A failure to include speech and language therapy means that it will remain an issue, particularly for vulnerable children. The task force report states that there is a risk of follow-through work not happening if hospital social workers are not linked to the child and family agency. </p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> The Minister cannot do everything overnight and she is taking the correct approach in establishing this agency. However, what this highlights is the need for the Government to look at the configuration of Ministries and departmental responsibilities. For example, it is ridiculous that we have a Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and disability who is not linked to the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills in a formal way. Ministers and Ministers of State are doing wonderful work but that is not the issue. We need to look at how their Ministries are configured. I know the establishment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has really brought this issue to the fore and that it is an issue at which we continue to look but matters like mental health, disability and special needs education are issues of child welfare. They affect children and families, including vulnerable children and families. </p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> I also want to put on the record of the House the comments of the Children's Rights Alliance. It is important to say that in its comments it acknowledges the "sterling work of the Minister" and describes this new agency as a powerful vehicle for delivery for children. That is a very positive response but the alliance has a number of queries which I hope we can address as this Bill progresses through the House. One concerns intra-agency relations. Will different professionals within the agency who are working under separate statutes be mandated to work together on cases and to share information on those cases? Will a social worker be entitled to share details with an educational welfare officer where both are working with the same child? How will the Bill interact with the provisions in the forthcoming Children First legislation? Will there be a mandated duty on professionals to co-operate? In respect of management, while the Bill sets out the lines of governance at the more senior level, it is not clear what arrangements will be at the organisational level given that bodies which previously had their own management and governance arrangements are being subsumed into the agency. Is a new system being created or will the existing systems of management and governance within the child and family agency and the NEWB continue to operate within the agency? These are detailed and, in many cases, technical questions that we can address as the Bill progresses but it is important to flag them at this early stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> It is very important to welcome the fact that we have reached this point and will have an inter-agency approach to delivering child welfare services. People can debate the semantics and technical detail and we are here to tease out these issues, but the establishment of this agency is a major step forward. It was a step that was not taken in the good times but one that the Minister has managed to do in difficult times. I commend her and the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1051">I welcome this legislation and the opportunity to make a contribution on Second Stage. The appointment of Deputy Frances Fitzgerald as the first full Minister for Children and Youth Affairs signalled this Government's intention to prioritise children and young people. The new Department of Children and Youth Affairs consolidates a range of functions which were previously the responsibility of other Ministers in areas such as health, justice, education, community and rural and Gaeltacht affairs. The new Department has managed to bring together a number of key areas of policy and provisions for children and young people, including the NEWB, the child and family agency and, since January 2012, the detention schools operated by the Irish Youth Justice Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> The programme for Government states the intention of the Government is to "fundamentally reform the delivery of child protection services by removing child welfare and protection from the HSE and creating a dedicated Child Welfare and Protection Agency, reforming the model of service delivery and improving accountability to the Dáil". That is exactly what this Bill does. It provides for the establishment of Ireland's first dedicated child and family agency, with a primary focus of delivering a single dedicated agency with its own dedicated management team and board reporting to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. </p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> The Bill has rightly been described as a milestone in the effective development of child protection services. The new agency will bring together key services which play a role in the welfare of children and families, including children and family services currently operated by the HSE, the child and family agency and the NEWB. The creation of the agency is being viewed as one of the largest and most ambitious public sector reforms undertaken by the Government. It involves the bringing together of over 4,000 staff and brings with it a budget of over €500 million from three existing bodies. It is my understanding that significant work has already taken place at an operational and logistical level to prepare for the establishment of the agency, including the recruitment of a senior management team and the breaking up of budgets into constituent parts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> The Child and Family Agency Bill 2013 is a comprehensive piece of legislation which provides for the subsuming of functions from three separate agencies. The Bill reassigns, under law, the sensitive and complex legal responsibilities which arise in respect of the care and protection of children and the promotion of their welfare. This important legislation will provide for the delivery of a caring, effective and efficient service for children in a consistent manner with clear standards and accountability. The new agency will seek to work with families and communities to identify early where additional support is required in order to improve outcomes for children. Sadly, we have had decades of failure in the field of child protection. The development of this new agency represents a key element in changing that legacy in the interest of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> It is a sad indictment that it has been 20 years since the Kilkenny incest case report of inquiry led by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness recommended that those who have responsibility for the support and safeguarding of children be brought together under one roof. We have had a litany of failures right up to the report last year by Geoffrey Shannon and Norah Gibbons on the deaths of children in State care. The commitment in the programme for Government to establish the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the appointment of a full Cabinet Minister marked the first step towards real change in the area of children and their welfare, care and rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> It is obvious that placing full responsibility with one Ministry is fundamental to any reform. For too long, the issue has been batted about between Departments where it was always regarded as at best, an add-on and at worst, something to immediately pass on. The children's rights constitutional referendum of last year was another important event as we seek to put children first.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_126"> The development of the child and family agency through this legislation marks a significant step forward in the complete restructuring of services for children and families and best represents what Mrs. Justice McGuinness outlined so long ago. It represents part of the essential response to recent reports on child protection failings. In my view there was a common theme in many of these distressing reports, namely fragmentation in service provision, which in turn led to inconsistency, abdication of responsibility and, worst of all, hurt and damaged children.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_127"> I must admit to having personal reservations about the State being regarded as the exclusive patron of child protection and welfare. The protection of children has to be viewed as a community or societal concern and not just that of social workers and the new child and family agency provided for in this legislation. All of us must think more about the part we can play in supporting and safeguarding children. I read with interest the reaction of agencies such as Barnardos and the Children's Rights Alliance to the legislation. They have been acutely involved in advocating for such legislation for many years. Their initial reactions were positive but they now outline what they see as weaknesses in sections 8 and 9, and I ask the Minister to have regard to their considered views as the legislation moves through the Houses of the Oireachtas. They have expressed specific concerns with regard to prevention and early intervention work and the definition of the role of parents and family. Their reasoning is sound and merits more attention on Committee Stage.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128"> In the previous Dáil, I was Fine Gael spokesperson on juvenile justice and I am glad to note some of the functions of the Irish Youth Justice Service will come under the remit of the new agency. Something which always struck me about the excellent work being done quietly by the Youth Justice Service was the return which came from preventative and early intervention actions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_129"> I welcome the legislation and look forward to the establishment of a single dedicated agency focused on the well-being of the children of the State.</summary>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_342">
          <from>Deputy John Browne<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1057">I welcome the Bill and this opportunity to speak on it. We support the principle of this long-delayed and much-promised Bill which formally establishes the child and family agency. I noticed when reading the Bill only two sections deal with the interests of children while six or eight sections deal with the role of the agency's chief executive officer, which surprises me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> The Bill will establish once and for all a unified approach to dealing with children's services. Up to now we have had a fragmented approach. During my time in the House we have had the introduction of the free preschool year, the establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Ombudsman for Children, a children's services policy, legislation introduced in 2001 and 2009, a review of the Children First guidelines, an independent review group on child deaths, and the Ryan report, the Monageer report and the Kilkenny incest report. While we have had all of these it is still true to say a very fragmented service has been provided, in particular by the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> Will the Minister clarify the situation regarding weekend services for child welfare? Child welfare issues do not conclude on Friday evening. In Wexford we have had the Dunne and Grace cases, which were terrible situations where young children died unnecessarily. From dealing on a day-to-day basis with cases, I am of the view it is very difficult to access services at the weekend. How does the agency intend to deal with this issue? Will the Minister outline her position on this area when she replies?</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> With regard to child welfare, I am greatly concerned about court services because in my opinion they are a total disaster. Families tell me they spend days in court as many cases are not heard but adjourned. Families sit there all day for one or two days, with no communication from legal people, the judge or his or her support services, and more often than not coming towards the end of the evening the cases are adjourned for a month or two. Families feel such delays are not good enough and more priority should be given to dealing with a case on the day it comes before the court. With the Minister seriously consider this?</p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> When I hear about a child welfare concern the first person with whom I make contact is the public health nurse, who usually takes on the case at that point. Why are public health nurses excluded? I ask the Minister to re-examine this before Committee Stage. The public health nurse is a very important person with regard to child welfare, and I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy Liam Twomey, would agree. On many occasions I have contacted local GPs when confronted with concerns about child welfare. It is very difficult to access HSE services after hours and I hope this will change. I am concerned about the exclusion of public health nurses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062"> Speech and language therapies are also not included and concern has been expressed about this. This needs to be dealt with and all Deputies would agree the speech and language services available in most counties are practically nil or there is a two or three year delay. Concern has been expressed to me that hospital social workers are not included either. They are very important because in some cases children end up in hospital and the social worker there becomes involved. I am concerned about their exclusion and I ask the Minister to examine this. I am particularly concerned about the exclusion of public health nurses and hospital social workers because they are very important components in dealing with child welfare issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> I welcome the fact the new agency will take over the inspection of child care services. The scenes in the "Prime Time" programme on RTE were very disturbing. We believe the inspection regime must be stepped up to ensure compliance with the regulations to be put in place. The current inspection regime is clearly inadequate. We also believe there must be renewed emphasis on staff quality in the sector. Parents need to know their children will be treated respectfully and that staff have the required training and capability to deal with children. We also want to see the introduction of fines where regulations are breached. Calls have been made on all sides of the House that the Government should consider withdrawing any grants paid to child care facilities which were completely flouting the law. In recent weeks we have heard approximately 22 child care providers in Mayo were not up to the standards required by the HSE. Many providers fail to provide rest areas for children and also fall down when it comes to hand-washing standards by providing cotton towels which can spread disease as opposed to disposable paper towels. The agency needs to deal with such issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064"> The agency itself has an important role to play in the future. I hope that when the agency is set up it will be broadly based, representative and composed of people with experience in the relevant areas and that we will not have political appointments of people without the required experience to run the agency. I am confident the Minister will ensure that will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> The 4,000 staff are very important. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Twomey, would agree that they must be spread adequately around the country because there seems to be a lack of staff in certain areas while there are more than adequate staff in other areas dealing with child welfare. The Minister must ensure that staff and finances are spread evenly and that every constituency and area gets an adequate allocation of both.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066"> Could the Minister indicate what role the agency will have in progressing disability services for children? Services for children with disabilities are very important and they must be delivered evenly across the board. There are excellent disability services in some counties. In Wexford there is the St. John of God House, Florence House, St. Patrick's special school and community workshops which provide facilities for people with disabilities. In other parts of the country there is a distinct lack of services for people with disabilities. What role will the agency have in providing services and facilities for children with disabilities and ensuring that the welfare of children with disabilities is adequately addressed? At present that is not the case in some parts of the country and it is important that every child would have proper facilities. I am sure the Minister comes across inadequate services for people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067"> I welcome the setting up of the agency. I am confident the Minister will ensure that the agency is capable of working adequately. I support other Deputies who have referred to agencies and bodies set up by previous Governments. When the HSE, the National Roads Authority and other bodies were set up by the previous Government one could not get a response to a parliamentary question about them. The Minister always replied that it was a matter for the agency concerned. I hope that when Members have concerns they will be able to table a question to the Minister and get an adequate response-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1070">I welcome the Child and Family Agency Bill. I welcome the Title in particular, which sums up the ethos of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071"> I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on the introduction of the legislation, which is a continuation of the outstanding work she has done in this newly created Cabinet position in this Administration in a relatively short period. Not only has she ensured that the rights of children are constitutionally protected and enshrined for the first time following the recent referendum, but she has made other incredibly important reforms in her Department. For the first time HIQA is inspecting child protection services. The first reports have already been published, for example, in Carlow-Kilkenny. Those reports are very helpful and necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072"> The Bill involves a significant reorganisation of services. It will introduce a dedicated management team for children’s services, which is critical, and it will reduce the number of managers in the area from 32 to 17. That merits emphasis in the House. It can only be good from every perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> The Minister has issued revised and strengthened guidelines on Children First and got relevant Departments to publish their plans for the implementation of Children First in order that children can be better protected. This cross-departmental approach is an important initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074"> The Minister has retained universal funding for the ECCE free early education year for young children. That is critically important. A successful example of such a crèche is located next door to where I live. The children are so happy they go running in there in the morning. Such a service is important for young children. The maintenance of the funding is a significant achievement in the current climate. A total of €14 million over three years has been secured by the Minister for funding of various initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> In recent years various reports were published on child care, family life and child protection. Almost all of the reports highlighted the pressing need to address the many deficiencies that are present within the system. The Children's Research Network report, which was recently published, outlined many ways in which we could improve on the current delivery of services to children and families. One of the key recommendations of the report is the improvement in the co-ordination of services between the various agencies and individuals who work with vulnerable children and their families. Now we will have a single dedicated agency overseen by a single dedicated Department. That is what is exciting, novel and radical about the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> The need for greater harmonisation and communication between the relevant agencies is a common theme running through almost every report on child protection over a long period. The Minister said, "Protecting children and supporting families are simply two sides of the same coin". That is why I welcome the Title of the Bill. I fully agree with that sentiment. One of the main themes of this legislation is to set up a child and family agency which will strengthen our policy on child protection, as outlined in the programme for Government. Part 2, section 8 reiterates that by stating that the new agency will “strengthen and encourage effective functioning of families”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077"> In recent years, statistics have shown that the demand for child and family services has increased. The recent national audit on neglect highlighted alcohol as an issue in 62% of cases. Lack of educational achievement – as alluded to by the Minister in her Second Stage speech – and truancy, are an indication of neglect. It is important that those issues will come under the remit of the agency because truancy is indicative of many other problems and should ring alarm bells. It is important that a joined-up approach is taken. In many ways, problems can be attributed to the financial strain that many families find themselves under as a result of the economic crisis. That is a factor as well in the context of difficulty. There has been a 10.5% increase among young people up to the age of 17 having difficulty. The indicative factors that led to the problem and need to be addressed are a combination of alcohol, under-achievement in education and lack of education among parents, and truancy. In light of that, there is all the more reason to ensure we not only have a strong service, but that we have a socially responsible service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078"> While we must face up to the fact that there are many families who may be fractured emotionally and physically, nevertheless we cannot deny that many families are genuinely doing the best for their children. That must be recognised and supported where possible. As the Minister herself noted, the family is the natural and fundamental unit in society and what affects the parent affects the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> Barnardos, the excellent supportive agency for children, has expressed concern about the level of emphasis on prevention and early intervention. I would be grateful if the Minister addressed this concern and reassured people when replying, as we want to ensure the emphasis is on the earliest intervention and support with a view to maintaining the family unit and keeping children where they should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080"> However, we cannot shy away from the fact that the best interests of the child must always be our main concern, yet may not always be best met within the family unit. Section 9 enshrines this fact in law. It ensures that, when the new agency is making large or small decisions, regard will always be had of the best interests and views of the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081"> The Minister stated that the family resource centres would continue to play an important role in the new child and family support agency and in the development of integrated community-based models for early intervention and family support, as envisaged in the children's referendum. I welcome this important provision. The service that the local family resource centres play within our communities is invaluable and I am glad to hear their role will not be diminished.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082"> The new child and family agency will employ up to 4,000 staff and, despite concerns expressed on the Opposition benches, will have a budget of €600 million. It will remove responsibility for child protection from the HSE, ensuring we have a separate agency solely dedicated to children at risk and their families. It will bring together a myriad of services, housing them under one roof. This will ensure a clear line of sight for the delivery of child protection and the Minister will have responsibility. I am heartened to know that she will be actively involved in setting targets and guidelines and in framing policy before the agency devises corporate strategies and annual business plans. The HSE became a scapegoat for all ills and a decoy for political responsibility. The Minister will ensure this situation will not be replicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> The agency will cover areas like child welfare, protection services, existing family support agencies and domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Importantly, it will be responsible for preschool inspections, for the 6,200 children in care, for the 1,500 young people in receipt of after-care and for the 40,000 in difficulty who are referred annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084"> Accountability is important. It should be enshrined in the legislation. Political accountability will still rest with the Minister, who will be answerable to the House. Every year, she will set targets and there will be a policy perspective. I am confident the agency will work and that this is the correct approach. Together with the constitutional amendment last year, the very establishment of the agency gives a primacy to children's rights and to the care of children and families that did not previously obtain. The agency's very existence sends a signal, as does the line of responsibility all the way to the Minister. Her accountability to the House and the people will be critical. The agency will bring all of the services together in a sharper and more focused way, making for a better service for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> Ultimately, this is a question of the welfare of children and their families, of trying to keep family units together and of trying to maintain a quality of life for all. I congratulate the Minister on this welcome legislation and I hope we will all be proud of its outputs.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_346">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1086">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important legislation. I acknowledge the Minister's presence in the House. I also acknowledge her commitment to the sector, particularly in my county of Donegal. If I am not mistaken, she has made the trip to Donegal five times. That is appreciated by the people involved in the various family resource centres and in the child care sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087"> I commend the Minister on meeting the representative groups from the family resource centres in Donegal. There was a meeting with groups from as far away as Moville, Na Dúnaibh, St. Johnston and Donegal town, including Cara House in Letterkenny. At that meeting, the participants welcomed the fact that the partnership model would be the way forward. The Bill will work towards that end. The model involves training, the vocational education committees, VECs, and various agencies while protecting the bottom-up nature of family resource centres. Although we refer to mainstreaming within community development, be it in the youth work sector or at a community development level, we must hold on to the philosophy of volunteerism and ensure a welcoming, accessible front to these groups. This type of philosophy must be protected as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> The Minister's investment in preschools in my county has been positive. She has put her money where her mouth is in terms of the infrastructure of many of the preschools. Thirty projects are being funded this year. This follows on from a substantial allocation last year. While this is welcome, progressing the training element will be the next step. As the Minister is aware, there are a number of constraints. Although there are extant preschools and everyone involved who I have met wants to upskill and retrain, timetabling is a challenge. If someone works all day Monday to Friday all year, attaining full-time university qualifications in normal programmes is becoming a particular challenge. We must be conscious of this issue in terms of upskilling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089"> Deputies have referred to the positives of early intervention. One cannot put enough value on what the preschool sector does for children as they progress into primary education. The more we can invest, the more we can empower many of the groups involved, be they community preschools or private preschools. If we can retrain and upskill people, it will benefit the groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090"> I wish to suggest a synergy between the Minister's Department and - believe it or not - the Tánaiste's Department. Every year, the Tánaiste focuses on reconciliation funding for groups on a cross-Border basis. There is an interesting project in Newtowncunningham. As succinctly as I can, I will reference what is happening there. As a result of the pressure of population expansion in Derry city, many families have moved into places like Killea and Newtowncunningham. Those parents had been sending their children to schools back in Derry, which is traditionally where they went to school. This sucked the lifeblood out of communities. Interestingly, those families are now sending their children to the preschool in Newtowncunningham. I understand that there are 38 such children from Newtowncunningham and as far away as Killea, if not quite Carrigans. An interesting progression trend is emerging whereby the preschool children of families originally from Derry are starting to attend Newtowncunningham's primary schools. Obviously, the families are building local relations in the preschool setting. Such a project advances reconciliation, pulls people together who would otherwise stay apart, leads to integration and breaks down prejudices and barriers on a cross-Border basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The Minister's Department could liaise on this matter with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, under the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore. We should assist this great, exciting opportunity in cross-Border reconciliation in a preschool setting, which will progress into primary schools as well.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1092">I sincerely thank the Technical Group for allowing me to avail of some of its speaking time. It is only right and proper to compliment the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and her excellent staff on this momentous job of work. It has taken considerable resources to bring the Bill to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> The Bill provides for the establishment of a body to be known as the child and family agency, the dissolution of the Family Support Agency and the National Educational Welfare Board and the transfer of the functions of those bodies to the child and family agency, and the transfer of certain functions of the Health Service Executive to the child and family agency. The establishment of the new agency is one of the largest and most ambitious public sector reforms being undertaken by the Government. It will involve bringing together 4,000 staff and a budget of more than €500 million from the three existing bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> I compliment the agencies that have done excellent work over the years, such as Barnardos and the Children's Rights Alliance. As the Minister knows, a multitude of agencies do this excellent work. Much of that work may be remunerated, but a lot of it is unpaid work undertaken by people with jobs who work above and beyond the call of duty. They include child care workers and voluntary staff who put in long hours, including at weekends, for which they may never be paid. They do it, however, because they are interested in the health, welfare and protection of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> Ms Maria Corbett, acting chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance, says that this Bill is critical. It provides the legal foundation stone upon which the child and family agency will be built. Ms Corbett also stated: "We know our system is broken. This Bill must begin to fix this dysfunctional system." On a first reading, the Children's Rights Alliance welcomed many aspects of the Bill but it is concerned that it has not gone far enough to firmly ground the new agency in children's rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> The Bill requires that the agency will have regard to the best interests of the child in all matters. While this provision is welcome, the alliance believes it should go further in order that the best interests of the child will be of paramount consideration in all aspects of the agency's work. This would better mirror the sentiments of the people who passed a referendum last November enshrining in law the principles of the best interests of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> Under the terms of the Bill, the new agency is required to consult children when planning and reviewing its services. Its functions relate to two specific pieces of legislation: the Child Care Act 1991 and the Adoption Act 2010. The agency is required to hear and take into account the views of the child, but these provisions are not new. They already exist in law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098"> The Children's Rights Alliance believes that the Bill does not go far enough, because the new agency must listen to children on all matters affecting their lives. A child's right to have his or her views heard and taken on board must be clearly enshrined in the Bill. Within each damning report on child protection, the common thread has been that the child's view was invisible. This theme was central to the children's referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> Everyone knows the excellent work that has been done for a long period by Barnardos. In that organisation's submission on this Bill, it was stated that services for children and families in Ireland have long been divided across departmental lines, particularly at national level. On the ground, services have developed in an <i>ad hoc </i>manner responding to local needs without a comprehensive national framework that helps to join the dots. Children and families engage with a myriad of services across Ireland, but the division of such services, which often target many of the same children and families, has led to their fragmented provision. That fails to put the child at the centre of such work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> We have all heard horror stories where different agencies were contacted by children who were in danger or living in an unhealthy environment. For one reason or another, those families slipped between the cracks and, thus, children were left in unsafe and unhealthy places. Those cases only came to light after many years. I will not go into specific cases but they were all national news when they came out. It would not be proper to name them here, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101"> We must ensure that in future those types of cases never recur. Children today and in future must be assured that their health, happiness, opinions and rights are of paramount importance to every politician in the land. The Minister deserves support for her work in introducing the Bill before us, which will help to protect children in future. I support what she is trying to achieve. I appreciate that agencies might have differing views on certain aspects of the legislation but, overall, people have broadly welcomed its provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> In discussing the well-being of schoolchildren, however, there are other aspects of Government policy that I would not agree with. These include bigger class sizes and the reduction in careers guidance counsellors. Such matters leave children vulnerable because their education and welfare may be neglected as a result. In the past, we could always rely on careers guidance councillors to spot a young person who was off form. They would take them under their wing and perhaps find out what was wrong at home. Unfortunately, such counsellors are now engaged in full-time classes due to the cuts. Those cuts were dangerous and it would be a horrible thing if we were to lose one child due to such cutbacks. None of us would want to condone such cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103"> I was not being political previously when I raised the reduction in the number of careers guidance counsellors. Many people might think that such counsellors are only trying to steer children towards certain careers and advise them on third level courses. They did such work but they also used their time intelligently to nurture the welfare of young students.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104"> People might say that in some ways children today are better off than we were, but I do not think so because they are facing a multitude of problems that we did not have to cope with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">Children are being abused and bullied online via computers and other devices, which we did not have when we were young, and drugs are now freely available to them. They are living in a completely different time and are faced with problems which did not arise even a few short years ago. It is of paramount importance that everything is done to put the child at the centre of everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106"> I support the Minister in terms of the important work she is doing in this area. While I am quick to criticise anything with which I am not happy, I am always willing to compliment good work. The Minister and her staff have the best interests of young people at heart. Pulling everything together can only lead to the better delivery of services for young people. </p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> I again thank the Technical Group for sharing time with me.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_348">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1108">I, too, thank the Technical Group for sharing time with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109"> I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill. At the outset, I would like to comment on the publication of this legislation. As the Minister will be aware, a large number of groups, organisations and individuals have a keen interest in this area and have been working with her and her Department in recent years on the preparation of this legislation. Concern has been expressed to me by a number of those organisations that the heads of the Bill were not circulated to them in advance of finalisation of the Bill, thereby giving them an opportunity to engage on the legislation and to add to it based on their experience, which could only have improved the legislation. It is regrettable that this did not happen. I hope that during the passage of this Bill the Minister will be open to engagement with the various organisations working in this area and to the amendments they propose to table to the Bill in the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110"> It is protocol that when a Bill is published, a period of two weeks is allowed to elapse before it comes before the House. It is a basic courtesy and an indication of respect for this House that Members are given an opportunity to consider legislation prior to the commencement of the debate on it. It is regrettable that this Bill was published last Friday and that it is now before the House, with Members expected to have considered it in detail. Given this is a particularly busy time of the year, it is unfortunate that the protocol was not respected and Members were not given sufficient time to consider the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111"> It is true to say that when it comes to children's services successive Governments have a sorry record in terms of the attention, or lack of it, which they have given to vulnerable children in particular. It is evident from the litany of scandals relating to the serious abuse and neglect of children, and often families, that this has not been a priority area for successive Governments. There has been serious neglect of responsibility at political level in terms of adequately resourcing and prioritising issues relating to children. While many high profile cases have come into the public domain and received a great deal of media and public attention, they have died down in a matter of weeks. It has then been a case of business as usual. Unfortunately, this has been the history down through the decades in terms of issues that affect children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112"> Children's services have in many ways been the Cinderella services of our health and social services. They have displayed a distinct lack of responsiveness to the needs of children. Whatever about the attention that has been focused on cases of sexual and physical abuse, cases of neglect have been ignored. These cases are usually the starting point in relation to a life of misery for many young people, with many ending up in care, getting into trouble with the law, becoming addicted to various substances, having a difficult life or dying young. There have been too many examples of where this has been the case. This happened because of a complete lack of accountability in terms of responsibility for children's services and a lack of resources, leading to lengthy waiting lists for services. </p>
          <p eId="para_1113"> While the big scandals have grabbed the attention of the public and media, there has been ongoing neglect of early intervention and prevention work. If one deals only with high profile, hard end cases, what one ends up with are cases which start off not particularly serious but which, because of neglect, then develop into serious ones. The principle of prevention and early intervention has never been accepted by the services. Another area of concern has been the lack of equity of access to services. We have not been good at identifying the level of need and providing services that are commensurate with that need. For this reason, areas of socio-economic disadvantage have lost out and been neglected and, in many ways, still are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114"> The question that must be asked is if this Bill addresses all of those issues. One of the biggest problems currently facing children's services is a lack of resources. Social workers with whom I spoke recently expressed serious concern about the current under-resourcing of services. We are almost past the mid-way point of the year and there is already enormous pressure on budgets. Social workers are expressing serious concerns about the lack of private placements for children who, when all other strategies have failed, they believe require a professional placement or to be taken into care and those placements not being available. In some cases, placements are only available if one child is removed from a placement to make room for another child. It is intolerable that this should be the case. </p>
          <p eId="para_1115"> A serious problem also arises as a result of the high level of social worker vacancies. This is resulting in many social workers having heavy caseloads, inadequate supervision of their work and their being at their wits end in terms of being able to respond to the serious cases which arise on a daily basis. Such is the level of concern of social workers and the Irish Association of Social Workers about the current situation they are raising it with Deputies and Senators this week. This matter requires urgent attention. It concerns me that often when we are speaking in theoretical terms about services for children in the real world many children are at serious risk in home situations from which they should be removed and placed in professional care and children who are already in the care system who are not being supported by social workers because of inadequate resources. This situation cannot be defended at any level. The fact that the country is in recession is no excuse for continuing to ignore the needs of the most vulnerable children in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116"> I welcome that children's rights and needs will be the focus of one agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">We should not fool ourselves that this will solve the problems as there are pitfalls in having a single focus agency. Two generally accepted principles apply to health and social services. First, services should, to the greatest extent possible, be provided at local, community or primary care level. This has become an established principle because the local, community and primary care levels are considered to be the first line of defence and most effective safety net. The second generally accepted principle in the health service is that services must be integrated. My concern in respect of the new agency is that the approach taken to its establishment flies in the face of the principles that local community care services should be provided through the primary care system and services should be integrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118"> In the past decade or thereabouts, the health service has undergone three different major upheavals arising from reconfiguration. I am concerned that we are yet again throwing things up in the air and waiting to see where they will fall, this time in respect of children's services. It is not social workers who generally detect the early indications of difficulties in a family. It is much more likely that a public health nurse, general practitioner or family support worker will identify a problem where children are concerned. While reform of the Health Service Executive is a major undertaking and understandably off-putting for a new Minister, establishing a new organisation in splendid isolation is not a solution either. Services should be integrated. From the point of view of service users, namely, children at risk and their families, the first port of call should be the primary care team, which should then be able to refer on as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119"> In my constituency, we have a wonderful primary care centre in Ballymun, with multidisciplinary teams that were fully staffed and responding to people's needs. As a result of the establishment of this agency, however, the social workers have been pulled out of the community and removed from the primary care teams. They are now working in a separate building and will work for a separate agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_1122"> I have set out some of the pitfalls in the approach being taken to the new agency. It is important that the Minister is open and serious about addressing these potential pitfalls during the passage of the legislation. The Children's Rights Alliance has also raised a number of issues in respect of governance, the exchange of information and inter-agency working which have not been fully thought out. I hope the Minister will be open to considering amendments to the legislation which can only strengthen the agency and services for young people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1123">I thank Deputy Ciara Conway for sharing time and allowing me to speak first.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124"> It is with enthusiasm that I address the proposed restructuring of children's services through the establishment of the country's first child and family agency. I have been present in the Chamber on many occasions when the Fianna Fáil Party asked the Minister to publish this Bill. I genuinely thank her for bringing the legislation before the House, although I regret to note that no Fianna Fáil Deputies are present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> As a former primary school teacher who worked in education for 31 years, I have learned that the well-being of children and their education are of vital importance. The services that will be offered by the child and family agency will create a stronger unit. Under the umbrella of the new agency, education, mental health, domestic violence support, general practitioner services and social work support will be brought together to ensure children receive better care. I fully support the creation of the new agency. Only the highest quality services and environments should be provided for our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126"> From her work as Minister with responsibility for children and her experience as a professional social worker, the Minister will be aware that the care provided to children must be of the highest quality. High quality care has many valuable aspects. A nurturing and friendly environment in which children are well cared for is essential. It is also vital that schedules and curricula in pre-school facilities and crèches are planned with careful thought and are age appropriate. Furthermore, systems in which communities and families communicate on a regular basis pave the way for excellent child protection and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127"> For too long, we have failed our children dismally. The prevailing view reflected the mantra that children should be seen and not heard, although matters have fortunately improved in recent times. The media, for example, have correctly focused on the shortcomings of child care and child protection. I have shown my support for victims of child abuse many times and retain a strong interest in and dedication to improving the child care and education systems. Our children must get the very best. </p>
          <p eId="para_1128"> The devastating and horrifying conditions of crèches that were exposed in a recent "Prime Time" programme sparked interest in a sector that should have been examined and monitored many years ago. My heart goes out to the victims of the 3,230 disclosures of direct child abuse which were presented in the 2012 Women's Aid annual report. Children need our help and cannot do without us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129"> I have visited numerous crèches and Montessori schools in Dún Laoghaire and its environs and have found high quality services on offer. I have seen small children with smiles on their faces being well minded. They were certainly not strapped into seats, treated poorly or neglected. On the contrary, they were engaged and interested in everything around them and I could sense their happiness and noted the interaction of staff. The environments I observed were nurturing, caring and child centred. I expect the child and family agency will work hard to promote and implement such an environment in every child care facility and crèche. I would fully support all such efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130"> Happy children are the reason I am here today. Children have shaped my career and nothing makes me smile like the smile on a child's face. However, the good conditions I saw in Dún Laoghaire cannot be a reality for all child care services unless the services strive to achieve them. Child care services need to be supported. I thank the Minister for engaging with the relevant agencies. For too long, the child care issue has been fluffed around and ignored. The highest child care standards must be adopted in all crèches.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131"> The measures proposed by the Minister will raise standards in our child care services to the levels expected and desperately needed. This is one of the biggest public sector reforms undertaken by this Government and funding will be of the utmost importance. In the context of child care services, funding makes a substantial difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132"> It takes great courage for parents to drop their children into crèches and leave them in the care of another adult in a place that is not their home. The trust and respect required is immense. We must do what we can to promote care, training and child care resources that are of the highest standard to incentivise parents to continue using such facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">Furthermore, the 4,000 proposed staff should have the highest education possible and be highly qualified to take on the major responsibility of minding young children. These educators and carers need support and funding in order to do their very best. Qualifications need to be standardised across the board and the importance of the job recognised. Many crèches and child care systems already demonstrate these high standards. I have faith in the Bill, in the Irish system and in the Government that this issue will not be disregarded or forgotten in a few years. The importance of quality child care provided by qualified staff cannot be undermined. These young children are our future and children are the living messages we send to a time we will not see.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134"> As I previously stated, in my career I advocate for victims of domestic violence, particularly women and children. I have faith that the child and family agency will provide a better and stronger support for children who are victims of such horrifying situations. Bringing key services such as HSE children and family services, the National Education Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency together can only provide stronger support services for children who find themselves in these terrible and emotionally scarring situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135"> I fully support the Minister in her excellent work. Ministers have flapped around in the past on this issue, but fundamental change was fluffed. While some money was thrown at the problem, we need to ensure our children get the best quality care so that the world is their oyster.</p>

          <p eId="para_1136">I thank the Minister for bringing the legislation before the House this evening. From our involvement in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, she will know this is an area of huge interest and the Bill represents a significant step forward in the area. In recent years we have had up to 17 major reports on child protection, mainly chronicling the period from 2000 to 2010. Although I am slow to make a political football out of it, I have seen other politicians make a political football out of the issue. Given that Fianna Fáil Members were jumping up and down about the pace of this legislation coming before the House, I find it very disappointing that there is nobody from Fianna Fáil in the House now. During the period from 2000 to 2010 when they were in government, they failed to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137"> Today represents a very significant step forward for children in this country. I have listened very closely to the debate. While resources are very important, they do not reflect the full story. Real reform is about practice and how we do things differently. Over a number of years in reaction to the various scandalous reports of how children's needs were neglected, money was thrown at it, but things did not change. I am very hopeful that things have changed in the run-up to the establishment of this agency. Up to now there was no standard model for risk assessment or referral; very limited interagency working; a shocking deficit in information and data management; poor budgeting and cost management; and an absence of accountability. What do those things mean? They mean it is very difficult for social workers - I was one before my election to this House - who often have to manage up to 25 or 30 cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138"> In the research carried out prior to the establishment of this agency, the national audit of neglect cases has shown the harsh reality of neglect. Up to 62% of families had family dysfunction associated with chronic alcohol or drug misuse, which is a very significant figure. As other speakers have mentioned, neglect is a very difficult thing to challenge. For example, a child may present in school, at a youth club or in a GP's surgery looking very unkempt, hungry and with poor colour. It may be a once-off incident and one may decide to give it another chance. However, the second time it happens, the person makes the referral. The social worker then goes out to visit and may discover the mother might be having a difficult time managing the household budget or have other stresses in her life. She might get some support, allowing the case to be closed. However, at times such cases have not been documented properly or there was not a proper filing system. As a result the child may subsequently present with signs of physical or emotional neglect, but the pieces of the jigsaw are not put together and it may result in a really serious case, such as we saw in County Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139"> The establishment of the agency will result in increased supervision of staff, being able to measure the kind of pressure people are under, while putting into place the overall systems regarding appropriate assessment, referral and paperwork. I have come across incomplete reports because people failed to keep records. As a social worker I was always very aware of the importance of keeping my notes as if somebody from the family was looking over my shoulder. Social workers should write the truth and write reports honestly because they are building up a picture of how these children are being affected. Sometimes without all the information it is very difficult to target the correct service to that family or child to ensure a better outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140"> The HSE carried out an audit in my area, Waterford. The pilot phase of the audit led to a substantive structural alteration of the deployment and governance of child protection services in Waterford. There needs to be a full review of what was learned from the audit carried out to provide assurances that children are being adequately protected. In addition new internal quality assurance arrangements have been introduced, including an increase in the frequency of staff supervision. It can be very trying for social workers who are faced with these very difficult situations in people's homes and also very difficult for the families. There is a very high staff turnover in child protection for a number of reasons, including the gender and age profile of staff, who may be on maternity leave more than other cohorts in the HSE. In my class of 90 people there were two men and the rest were women. It is a predominantly female workforce. It is also a very difficult job and if management are not looking after the staff appropriately and providing with them the kind of supervision they require to ensure they are meeting their professional standards, it can be a very difficult and trying situation for any worker.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141"> Deputy Shortall spoke about primary care. I refute the points she made about there being no joined-up thinking. If we are still thinking that everybody needs to be in the same building sitting at a desk across from one another to interact and share information on children and families appropriately, we are in a much worse situation than I thought. Not having people sitting in the same building or sharing an office does not prevent the high-quality interagency work going ahead. I have every faith that primary care centres will continue to work and liaise with the child and family agency to ensure we get in early and are able to deal particularly with cases of neglect that have serious and long-lasting consequences for children and families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142"> I refer again to the national audit of neglect cases carried out. In 62% of such families the biggest issue was alcohol misuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">Despite this we have seen a debate unravel outside the Chamber relating to people's hesitancy to take on alcohol advertising in the country. Some 62% of children in families in neglect cases are paying a high price because of alcohol. If we are to be serious about tackling the issues and harsh realities that exist for children and families in this country, then it is not only the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, who has responsibility. Other Ministers have a responsibility to deal with the problem of alcohol. There are myriad suggestions before the Government and these should be pursued to ensure we can improve the harsh reality of life for 62% of children in this country suffering because of the negative consequences of alcohol. People should think about that when they are debating other issues relating to taking on alcohol advertising.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1144">I am pleased to be able to speak on the Child and Family Agency Bill. I have welcomed the Minister since her appointment to her job and I have wished her well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145"> Up to 4,000 staff will be transferred to the new child and family agency which is being established following the long-standing criticism of the handling of child protection and social services by the HSE. The new child and family agency will be one of the largest public bodies in the State. It will require a major cultural shift. It will have an estimated budget of €500 million. The new agency has been formed as an alternative to the old HSE child and family services area. It is envisaged that by creating an independent agency, children's rights, child protection, child welfare and family support would be given additional priority and resources from within the vastness of the old HSE structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146"> Child protection and children's rights were not prioritised previously, a fact admitted by Brendan Drumm when he was departing as chief executive of that organisation. However, the creation of the new agency should be done carefully and strategically. There is a risk that the practices and culture of the HSE could transfer to the new agency, especially given that almost all of the staff who will be working in the new agency are currently working within the HSE. That is a serious concern because there are some appalling practices and poor management issues within the HSE. Obviously, it is too big and it is literally out of control and has been for many years. I stood on the other side of the floor as a backbencher for many years begging the Taoiseach of the day and the then Minister, Ms Harney, to disband the HSE because it was dysfunctional as far as I was concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147"> We have heard all manner of promises from the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to the effect that he would but he has not done so. He said he would. I believe he has set up a new board and he has made an interesting choice as chief executive, Mr. Tony O'Brien, following a Bill that was passed last week. We know his chequered history, where he came from, the views he held and the organisations he chaired. One of these has been under investigation for the past 18 months. There has been an abject failure by the Department to bring that investigation to fruition. It related to family planning institutions giving out dangerous, highly illegal and, in my view, criminal information to the most vulnerable people. There has been no investigation. First, we were told there would be an investigation. Then, when I asked the Tánaiste about it in the House two weeks ago, it was demoted to an audit. I suppose now that they have got what they wanted, they will abandon it altogether and that is where it will be left.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148"> Some would say these child care professionals are coming from an organisation where the main focus has been on responding to emergencies and emerging scandals. That is not an environment conducive to a focus on children's rights. For these professionals the change is an opportunity to work in an organisation that is true to the ethos of how they were trained and is in line with international best practice. The reality is that front-line social care workers care deeply about the safety and outcomes for our children. Staffing has been reduced by up to 20% and yet they continue to fight to keep Irish children safe. I salute the many social workers and child care professionals who work tirelessly and go above and beyond the call of duty, but the system is simply not functional. Some have expressed concern that key professionals such as child psychologists and public health nurses may not end up transferring to the agency. Government sources have said that discussions are ongoing with some of these groupings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149"> I have met some of these groupings and staff. They have major concerns about the services they have to try to deal with. If these staff are transferred then these services will be rendered inoperable. That is the major concern they have. I hope that it will be sorted out because these things seem to happen and then the Minister tries to line up the situation afterwards but it is difficult to do it then.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150"> Documents obtained by <i>The</i>
						<i>Irish Times</i> show that there has been serious internal opposition within the health service to the proposed changes as they apply to clinical psychologists. We all know that and it is on the record. I hope the Minister is aware of it and is dealing with it. I hope the Minister will find it easier to deal with her colleague than the former Minister of State did with her senior Minister. Critics have said that a failure to bring key professionals under the umbrella of the agency could lead to the same weakness that characterised the handling by the HSE of child protection issues. That weakness is well documented with many flaws.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151"> The former Barnardos director of advocacy, Norah Gibbons, has been appointed as the first chairwoman of the board of the new child and family agency. I believe that being a boss in Barnardos does not give one the right to be chairperson of one of these organisations. We know who the chief executive of Barnardos was, a certain Mr. Finlay. When he was unable to go for the role of President he fell back into this job there. He was on radio in RTE for approximately two years as a columnist every evening using air time to promote himself for the presidency. He was supposed to be in charge of Barnardos. I have questions over the likes of the carry-on in Barnardos and its behaviour in the recent children's rights referendum as well. Ms Gibbons served as a member of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, chaired the Roscommon child care inquiry and co-chaired the independent child death review group. I do not know anything about the lady but all that should give her ample experience and example to deal with serious situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152"> The creation of the new agency needs to be done carefully and strategically. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has acknowledged that there are 30,000 referrals to the child and family services every year. There are 1,500 cases of abuse and neglect confirmed every year as well. There are vulnerable children in cases where there is alcohol and drug addiction in families. There are young children in day care centres who are not getting enough food. We have seen some of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153"> I have been involved with several crèches in south Tipperary and I am chairperson of one of them. The vast majority of them are good. It was said on a programme by a Member of one of the Government parties, Deputy Durkan, that the workers did not have the vocation anymore. I do not know what way he described it but the vast majority of them have indeed. There will be abuses but there have been checks recently. I have seen that and I am pleased they have taken place. In any event, the people I am talking about are committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154"> Do we need a totally new agency? Will it be another quango? I know we have a new Minister and I am pleased about that, but must we have another agency with a vast budget and 4,000 staff? Will we be able to siphon the staff from the HSE? Will they be let go? Will it become another quango that the Minister will be unable to control? I certainly hope not, because I am sick and tired of quangos throughout the country, many of which are self-appointed. The Government promised that it would get rid of them and instead it has increased them and they are not accountable to anyone. I accept the bona fides of the Minister and I know she will do her best, but some of these people become more powerful than the quango they act for.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155"> We cannot forget the many foster families who, long before child agencies were set up in the HSE, were taking in children. We cannot forget the many convents and other groups. We are dealing with Magdalen laundries and so on now. However, we cannot forget the good work done by all of the sisters and brothers in looking after children. We can never say that it is totally the fault of the convents or the orders. The State also has a major responsibility, as do the families who put these people in the laundries as young children.</p>

          <p eId="para_1159">If I could continue, I would appreciate it. They are still offering to give many supports but they cannot be allowed to be labelled with the whole mess. There is a suggestion that it was all their fault, but it was not. I know some of the families involved - Deputy Doherty might know some of them as well - who banished their youngsters into these places. I did not know they existed until they came back to mind loved ones in later years. That is what went on in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160"> While it now is fine to pick on the church, the laity and some of the religious orders and to blame them for everything, the State also had responsibility, as had the families. As I stated, one cannot forget the outstanding families who have given voluntary and gallant service, in many cases without assistance from the Health Service Executive, HSE. Such families did not get a shilling from the HSE, were not approved by the HSE and now are not being recognised for pension rights or anything else - the Minister is aware of some issues I brought to her attention previously - but have given sterling service over decades when there was no agency and no HSE staff to mind or look after them. Their great work must not be forgotten or banished in the rush to set up this new agency and Members must make sure those people get recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161"> As for the 4,000 people involved, what impact will this have on the HSE? Members have seen the impact the loss of staff has had on foot of the redundancy packages, as in many areas, the HSE cannot cope. For example, hospitals in my own locality cannot cope as they have insufficient staff. If one takes 4,000 staff members from the HSE, what gaps will be left behind? As I have stated previously, the HSE has a disgraceful culture in many areas with deplorable waste and pathetic management. Many of its senior managers previously were ordinary clerical officers who worked up the line. Many of them never got any experience of managing so much as a chicken coop and have no experience of management but now have landed, because of promotion and other issues, in senior management positions for which they have no experience or understanding. They could not manage people because they were never trained to so do and this is the reason the abject failures exist but no one wants to wake up and acknowledge that. Moreover, the trade unions that represent such people also do not wish to acknowledge these abject failures on the part of people who have no qualifications, understanding or experience and no wish to have proper management. This issue must be dealt with and the Minister should not allow any of this culture to enter the new agency through these same people, who in many cases are career public servants who seek to be chief executive officers, if they can. At present, it is a case of having too much management. In the hospitals and everywhere else, one finds every kind of manager one could think of from the strategic manager to the bed manager to the floor manager to the ward manager to the God knows what kind of manager. When matrons ran the hospitals, there were no managers but there were clean hospitals without any infections and without the frightening situation that now obtains, with many cases of chronic overcrowding and inadequacies within the system. As a result, many hospitals are unable to attract the staff, medical and otherwise, that are needed. This is mainly because of poor management.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162"> In addition, the quality of foster parents was and remains poor to this day. I refer to some recent reports drawn up by people regarding standards in Dublin, the north east and other areas and I reiterate there are poor foster carers. I do not know how they obtained Garda vetting clearance or how they got and continue to get children in spite of the families concerned being involved in violence, drugs, alcohol and other issues and this beggars belief. I acknowledge they are a minority but I personally know of them. I am not speaking anecdotally but am aware of them myself as they have been brought to my attention as a public representative over the years. I have complained to the Garda and to the health services but nothing was done about it. It is frightening to think that vulnerable children would be placed in such situations. I reiterate it concerns a tiny minority but even if it only affects one child, it is too much and I speak from personal experience. Consequently, Members must ensure this cannot happen and I personally do not believe that establishing a new quango, with all the aforementioned staff members and a budget of €500 million, will make it good simply because big is wonderful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163"> I have to hand a press release from the Children’s Rights Alliance in response to the publication of the Child and Family Agency Bill 2013. While the alliance has given it a guarded welcome, the headline to the release states "Alliance Responds to Child and Family Agency Bill 2013 - The legal foundation for fixing a broken system", which is an admirable heading for any press release. However, as it is a broken system, the question is whether it will be new or different. Can the Minister appoint people from without the system, rather than all of them being drawn from within the system, because the system literally has admonished itself and has grown to be unmanageable? Can people also be brought in from external sources, particularly those with management techniques and people management skills, as well as expertise in staff and employment legislation and so on? The acting chief executive of the alliance states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1164">This Bill is critically important. It provides the legal foundation stone upon which the Child and Family Agency will be built. We know our system is broken: this Bill must begin to fix this dysfunctional system. On a first reading we welcome many aspects of the Bill, but are concerned that it has not gone far enough to firmly ground the Agency in children’s rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">She continues by stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1166">We believe the Bill does not go far enough. The Agency must listen to children on all matters affecting their lives. The child's right to have his or her views heard and taken on board must be clearly enshrined in the Bill. Within each damning report on child protection, the common thread was that the child’s views were invisible. This theme was central to the Children’s Referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">It certainly was, but why then did the Government abuse the children's referendum?</p>
          <p eId="para_1168"> The Minister knows what I am about to say because I have raised this matter in the Chamber more than 20 times. A certain gentleman took a case to the High Court and the Supreme Court and I note Members have been listening for several months to debates on legislation regarding the protection of family and life because of a Supreme Court case and a judgment made 20 years ago, which now is even being queried by one of the judges concerned. However, time has moved on, as have science and law. The case to which I refer is more recent and pertains to the fact that Members of this House, including me, voted €3 million to be expended on the children's referendum but the Government could not do that and leave the commission to be set up. Instead, it had to put its hand into the till and steal €1.1 million of the money that was passed. These are not my words but €1.1 million of the money was stolen out of the-----</p>

The Government refused to acknowledge it. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, when he appeared on the "Six One News" on the evening of the Supreme Court decision, kept referring back to the High Court. However, the Supreme Court decided and the judgment is there for everyone to read. They are not my words but in a five-judge judgment, the Supreme Court gave a damning indictment on what the Government did.</p>

          <p eId="para_1204"> Consequently, what faith can people have? It now is proposed to set up another Oireachtas inquiry, five years later, to look into the banks. This is a politically-expedient decision by the present Administration to try to blame the previous Government. All I have been listening to since I came in here has been people criticising.</p>

          <p eId="para_1208">The Minister should set about doing the work, rather than talking about it or talking about what was not done. She should ensure, as I noted, that the bad practices in the HSE are left behind. Moreover, perhaps Deputy Conway, who has left the Chamber, should not criticise Deputy Shortall, who has a lot of experience in the House, considerably more than either me or indeed Deputy Conway. Deputy Shortall had the experience and the insight within the Department of Health to see what was going on in there. There is no faster education than being put into the thick of it to find out what is going on and she should be listened to, because she has valuable views and it is not for any other Member here to denigrate them. When Deputy Conway has been in the House for as long as has Deputy Shortall and when she has that experience, she can talk then. Deputy Shortall has that experience in the Department of Health, as well as considerable experience in this area over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209"> I repeat that I am concerned about the siphoning off of 4,000 jobs from the HSE. It should be disbanded and reactivated and perhaps it should all be done together but 4,000 jobs are being taken from the HSE.</p>

          <p eId="para_1214"> Making the establishment of a new agency with €500 million the headline of the Minister's speech will not make it manna from heaven. It will have 4,000 staff and a budget of roughly €500 million. That does not make it right. There are many bad practices in the HSE, as the Minister is well aware, and I outlined some of them that took place under several Governments.</p>

Will your office or the Office of the Ceann Comhairle have the speech just made examined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges? People have been named in the Chamber and they are not here to defend themselves. It is the worst abuse of parliamentary privilege I have witnessed. Two, if not three, people who are not Members of this House and cannot defend themselves had their names thrown around in the course of the previous speech in an absolutely shocking fashion. I do not know the people concerned and I am not familiar with the issues that were mentioned, but people outside of this House are entitled to their good name. When a Member of this House openly attacks them in the fashion we have just seen, it is incumbent on this House to ensure their names and reputations are restored.

          <p eId="para_1258">I also wish to note that at no stage did I interrupt the previous speaker.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The establishment of the child and family agency is one of the hallmarks of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. For too long the protection of children has been the poor relation in this State. The litany of reports that have been commissioned show that children at all levels have been neglected, and in some cases that neglect has been covered up and institutionalised. The Minister is the first Minister at Cabinet level to have responsibility for children, and I compliment her on taking this initiative forward. It follows the very successful children's referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260"> The people who signed the Proclamation in 1916 signed a commitment to cherish the children of the nation equally, so it is a shame and an indictment of our country that in 2013 we are establishing this agency but until now children's issues and the protection of children were farmed out to a multitude of different agencies. This is a first step. I hope that in the debate on this and later Stages of the Bill the Minister will look at other issues that are not currently covered by the Bill and perhaps consider if there might be room to include them. I am speaking in my capacity as a former teacher, albeit for a short but very important period in my life. I am sure other Members have had the same experience as me, where parents come to them with regard to orthodontic care, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy or occupational therapy. From the time children come into this world there are too many different agencies dealing with the problems they encounter in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261"> All too often, it falls back on the teacher, particularly at primary school level, to try to sort out the problems, be they social, health, educational, physical, disability or even income within the family home. For the first time we have an opportunity to examine children's care, the neglect of children and the protection of children in a more holistic way. There is often a temptation to farm the issue of children to the Department of Education and Skills, because we expect our children to be minded, for want of a better word, inside the primary school classroom. However, that should not be the case. All the reports that have been produced in the last number of years have shown there has been a catalogue of failures. In many cases, teachers and the National Educational Welfare Board are powerless. Children are missing from school for many days more than what would be considered the norm and they are powerless to do anything. There are even situations where truancy in some schools is almost accepted, because that is the way it has always been.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262"> I do not wish to see this agency become a type of modern HSE stooge but an agency that is stand alone, independent and, most importantly, accountable. We should not be here two or three years hence putting parliamentary questions to this or another Minister and receiving replies like those we get at present from the Department of Health - although I am aware that this is due to change - stating that it is a matter for the HSE, which will revert to the Deputy. We must have real accountability, because children cannot speak for themselves. In many cases these are the most marginalised children, as 99% of the children in this State will probably never need the child and family support agency. However, for the children that do, the Members of the Oireachtas, who are elected on behalf of the people, and the members of the committee on health and children must know they will be able to ask the pertinent questions and get real answers from the people ultimately charged with delivering services to children. One of my concerns, and it is something that should be included in the legislation, is that there be a reporting mechanism whereby Members of the Oireachtas can hold the agency, the board, the chief executive and others to account. This should be done not through a committee once every couple of months but through us being able to hold the Minister accountable on a weekly or daily basis by parliamentary questions, Topical Issues or whatever means are available in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263"> Often it is far too easy to compartmentalise this issue as an issue of education, and I am concerned about that. I agree with what Deputy Conway said. Reports have been published recently, including in my own constituency, and it is important to point out that the vast majority of early child care, preschool and child care providers are doing a fantastic job. Undoubtedly, however, there is room for improvement. As previous speakers have said, I hope there will be a continuation in the establishment of standards and in setting a curriculum and that preschool will be built into the educational curriculum with minimum standards, proper training and, ultimately, a desired outcome, which is, as is contained in the Proclamation hanging in the lobby of these Houses, that we cherish all the children of this State equally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">That must be our guiding principle. In the context of all the sideshows and name-calling that occurred earlier, the people in the Visitors Gallery are probably disgusted by the fact that parliamentary privilege has been so badly abused. I ask the Minister, as a representative of the Cabinet, take this issue very seriously. Two people have been defamed during this debate and they have a right to have their good names restored.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265"> I commend the Minister on the work she is doing. She and her staff are very accommodating and many of her Cabinet and junior ministerial colleagues could do worse than to consider the work they are doing. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#ReginaDoherty" eId="spk_444">
          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1266">The clear message being sent out by the recently formed Department of Children and Youth Affairs and its Minister has received a major boost today. The new child and family agency, which will initially incorporate the Family Support Agency and the National Education Welfare Board, will create a child-centred system whose services will respond to the needs of children where they arise as opposed to those children and their families being obliged to adapt to that system. We have been informed that local multidisciplinary teams will bring local services under one manager, with direct lines of communication to a centralised office under the jurisdiction of Mr. Gordon Jeyes. Mr. Jeyes, whom I have come to know during the past six to nine months, is a superb catch for this country. There will be clear lines of accountability and the provision of child and family services will be the exclusive job of every senior executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267"> What Deputy Mattie McGrath stated about people from the HSE joining the new agency and bringing a culture with them was absolutely outrageous. These people care about children and about ensuring that a single functioning agency with clear lines of responsibility and accountability will provide the services they require. A total of 17 major strategy reports on child protection failings in Ireland have been compiled since 1980. The most recent of these, the Gibbons-Shannon report into the death of children in care, which was published last year, shows that at one point 15 different agencies were involved with one young person who died. The Bill is very welcome because it will reform our fragmented child protection system by increasing accountability, providing early services and - for once - applying joined-up thinking. The most shocking aspect of the report on the deaths of children in care is not really the neglect and abuse detailed but rather the systematic chaos caused by an overabundance of agencies and institutions being involved in dealing with such children. The children in question were vulnerable and they had extensive contact with so many public services designed to protect them. However, each of those services failed at different stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268"> The child and family agency represents a fresh start. It is clear from the legislation that family services will be prioritised. The latter was not the case in the past. Under the Bill, we will move from a position where child and family welfare was barely a priority to one where it will be the sole focus of a single dedicated State agency overseen by a single Government Department and an extremely dedicated Minister. This new agency is arguably the most significant development for child and family services in the past 20 years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jim Daly<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1269">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill and to acknowledge the very fundamental shift in emphasis it represents for the Legislature, the Government and, most importantly, the children of Ireland. I also welcome the renewed attention and focus on the welfare of children who are born in this country. Everyone on this island shares the view that children are our greatest asset.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270"> There has been a great deal of debate regarding the unborn child and women who experience crisis pregnancies in recent months. It is now time to reflect on the very positive role foster families have played in providing real options for women who find themselves pregnant and unable to care for their children. Unlike the minority of persons who believed themselves to be in possession of the high moral ground and who engaged in a level of pontificating engaged during that debate, foster families have quietly continued to quietly offer real solutions by increasing the range of options open to women experiencing crisis pregnancies. I hope many more families will consider becoming foster carers and will be willing to provide care for children in their own homes from birth onwards.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jim Daly<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1272">There is room for improvement in the Bill and, as is the case with most other legislation, it could go further. The reality is, however, that it represents a significant step forward into the light and away from the very dark days of our past. In recent years we have all been convulsed with shame and anger at the appalling treatment meted out to our most precious resource, namely, our children. The low standards which obtained in high places horrified society to its very core. Legislation and Governments can only go so far in providing a better and brighter future for our children. The key dominant factor in the context of the opposition to the recent referendum on children's rights was an objection to interference by Government in the family unit. Neglect and abuse of children are all too often associated with the State and with church institutions. The reality is far more difficult and uncomfortable, with much serious abuse taking place in family homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273"> The reports into recent horrific episodes of child abuse highlight the difficulties and challenges posed in the area of child protection by disjointed and fragmented responsibility shared across a range of Government Departments. The onus is clearly on this Parliament to create a coherent and streamlined organisation which will dedicate all of its resources and attention to developing a comprehensive range of services for children who are vulnerable and at risk. I welcome the Government's commitment to children since entering office. I am particularly proud to be a member of the Government which, for the first time in the history of the State, deemed children worthy of a senior Ministry. Its commitment and focus in this regard were followed up by a referendum aimed at firmly enshrining the rights of children in our Constitution, to give children a voice and to recognise that their views and needs are equal to those of their parents. I await the implementation of the relevant legislation required in the aftermath of that referendum because it will allow thousands of children in State care to exit the current legal limbo in which they find themselves. It will also bestow on these children the same right enjoyed by the remainder of the citizenry of Ireland, namely, to belong to and to be part of a loving and caring family. I am aware that a court challenge has delayed the introduction of the legislation to which I refer. I hope the courts will adjudicate on this issue without further ado in order that we might grant these children access to one of the most basic rights of all - the right to belong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274"> I wholeheartedly welcome the legislation and commend the Minister for addressing the need for cohesive and collective organisation and delivery of services for vulnerable children. I also welcome the establishment of the child and family agency and the renewed emphasis on the provision of services for children. One of the more necessary aspects of the legislation is the fact that the agency will be answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Minister. It has long been believed that when a job is everyone's job, it quickly becomes no one's job. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to the speedy and successful establishment of the agency, which will hopefully allow us to begin to put our darkest days behind us and which will lead us to a brighter tomorrow.</p>

          <p eId="para_1275">I thank all Deputies for their contributions and for their support for the child and family agency. There were some very thoughtful and thought-provoking contributions on the development of the new agency. I listened with interest to the valuable input of Deputies on all sides. The various issues raised will be considered further by my Department as the Bill makes its way through the Houses. I was particularly interested in the representations Deputies indicated had been made to them by a number of outside agencies. I will examine the points those agencies have made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276"> I wish to reassure the House that early intervention will very much be part of the work of the new agency. I reaffirm my commitment in this regard. The Bill makes explicit provision for the inclusion of a range of services - beyond just those relating to child protection - which are considered critical in delivering a sustainable and comprehensive continuum of supports aimed at prevention, early intervention and assisting families. The supports to which I refer include family resource centres, education and welfare services and psychology services. I wish to reassure the many Deputies who raised the issue of resources that we are recruiting social workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277"> Many speakers referred to the issue of accountability to the House. Section 47 imposes an unambiguous statutory obligation on the agency to comply with a direction of the Minister. In the context of the specific questions regarding accountability to the Oireachtas, I will continue to answer parliamentary questions in respect of the agency. This is clearly laid out in the accountability and governance sections relating to the agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278"> I thank all Deputies for the care they have taken in respect of this debate. I also thank them for the quality of their contributions and their clear passion for and interest in this matter in the context of providing the very best services for children. I welcome their support for the reorganisation of those services, which, as so many reports have shown, have been fragmented up to now. The child and family agency is an essential response to dealing with the issues that have been highlighted over the years in many reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279"> This Bill has been introduced in the context of a wide-ranging reform process regarding children services and should be recognised, as many Deputies have recognised it, as a key component in the change process. I am committed to addressing significant efficiencies that have been identified in the State's care and protection of vulnerable children and all workable initiatives to deliver this reform effectively will be considered by the agency and by myself with an open mind. I thank everybody for their contributions. I look forward to dealing with the remaining Stages and to enacting this legislation as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1287">The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission confirmed to me yesterday that it is overburdened and under-resourced. Since it opened its doors to the public in May 2007 it has received some 3,500 complaints, 900 of which allege criminal behaviour on the part of gardaí. Sinn Féin is of the view that if the GSOC is to achieve its stated and essential mission of providing an effective complaints mechanism in which the public can have confidence, then the Government must make additional resources available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288"> In many respects not much has changed since then. There is still an issue as regards how the Garda co-operate with the GSOC. We saw that recently with an issue relating to Mr. Kieran Boylan who was allegedly found with significant amounts of cocaine and heroin and is a convicted drug dealer; he had serious charges dropped against him with no explanation and there was also the question of how he obtained a haulage licence after his conviction. This led to much discussion, particularly after the GSOC highlighted the matter. It has said in its correspondence with Oireachtas Members that it does not have the ability to do the job it is asked to do. The report used words such as "grave concern" about the level of co-operation from An Garda Síochána with an investigation into an extremely serious matter where allegedly a drug dealer had charges dropped. The GSOC reports seeking information from gardaí and being queried as to its relevance as well as being obstructed in different respects. That is not good enough. Clearly, there is need for reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289"> I welcome this legislation. It is positive and it can add to the independence of the commission and ensure that it has the power and teeth to carry out its task. The board the legislation seeks to set up will include representations from joint policing committees, JPCs. I am a member of three JPCs, Youghal, Cobh and Mallow, and I recognise the excellent work that they do. It is where the community has its say. However, it does not have enough powers or strength and this would be a welcome new role. Notwithstanding that point, we would take a different approach to that taken by the proposers of the Bill. What Sinn Féin is calling for is an entirely autonomous and independent policing authority with its own independent budget and with strong powers of investigation. We also believe that it is important that there is a separation of the Government from the Garda. The power of appointment of senior gardaí by the Government must be removed in order to enhance transparency and oversight. However, these are issues which could be addressed on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290"> I recognise the essential role of the Garda Síochána and the considerable commitment most gardaí show in fulfilling their duty. From my experience of working with gardaí on the ground and on JPCs, I know many of these gardaí and know them to be excellent, honest, community-minded gardaí who would never abuse their power. However, it is essential that we have tools to punish and remove gardaí who do wrong. I believe that this is not only the interests of the wider community and of justice but it is the interests of honest gardaí that the reputation of the force be underpinned by a strong ombudsman system.</p>

          <p eId="para_1291">I commend Deputy Wallace and his colleagues on bringing forward this Bill. It is a thoughtful contribution and it is overdue in terms of what we need. Much of the focus in recent times has been on issues that are certainly important but they are not the most important in terms of what we need from An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292"> I believe every Member of this House would agree that the overwhelming majority of the men and women in An Garda Síochána are people of the highest calibre. We are very proud of them, we know them personally, we went to school with them, we played football with them and when we leave our children to school or go to the supermarket we meet them. They are an integral part of our community. They are proud of what they do. That is not the issue. The issue here is about the power we bestow on them, the great power and responsibility we give them on behalf of our communities and the fact that some within An Garda Síochána have abused those powers. Unfortunately, we have seen in the history of all organisations that at some time power is abused. Therefore, we need checks and balances to protect our citizens from the abuse of power but also to protect the good name of An Garda Síochána and the good name of the overwhelming majority of gardaí who have never abused power and who have often spoken out against it. I commend in particular the whistleblowers who have raised issues of considerable public importance to their own personal detriment. Long live whistleblowers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293"> In terms of the existing issue of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, the Garda inspectorate and other institutional changes, they did not fall out of a tree. They followed the debacle of the Morris tribunal in my home county where a nest of vipers who were not worthy of the name "garda" had abused their power in the most appalling fashion. The Morris tribunal revealed that sorry saga, particularly the use of informers and in some cases so-called informers to gain promotion. It was an appalling period in my county's history. Mr. Justice Morris made a series of recommendations and they were to have been implemented. That is what gave birth to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission but unfortunately from the outset it did not have the powers it required to hold the Garda to account. If there is any doubt about that, it was blown away by the report that the GSOC has given to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner in regard to what is known as the Kieran Boylan affair, the fact that a convicted drug dealer, allegedly in possession of cocaine and heroin worth €1.7 million, had charges dropped against him without any explanation. That investigation, which took four years, exposed a number of deeply troubling issues. As stated by the GSOC, it showed that the lessons of the Morris tribunal have not been learned and that it has grave concerns about the handling of informers and the retention of contemporaneous notes, which are critical to retrospective investigation. That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294"> The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, which also recently came before the committee that I chair, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, has confirmed that it has faced serious blockages in its investigations. At times senior gardaí have questioned the relevance of the documents that it has sought to attain. There is a real need for serious additional powers to be given to it. That is the reason this legislation is so important. Sinn Féin would put forward proposals to strengthen it. We would work with the Deputies here on Committee Stage if the Bill was allowed to go forward, and it should be, to try to strengthen it. We believe there should be an independent policing authority. We would like to see more of the powers of accountability that are in the North of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295"> We would also like to see a good deal of what is in place in terms of the Policing Board of Northern Ireland replicated in terms of joint policing committees. The joint policing committees in this State need to be strengthened. We need to ensure that the Garda is completely independent from the State. We cannot have a situation any more where Ministers appoint senior gardaí and they in turn defend cutbacks, the closure of Garda stations, and reduction of Garda vehicles numbering in the hundreds, in the face of the clear evidence to the contrary from the Garda Representation Association and gardaí on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">The days of a <i>quid pro quo</i> arrangement, where the Minister of the day circles the wagons around any criticism of senior gardaí while they in return circle the wagons around any criticism of the Minister by defending cutbacks, have to end. That is why this Bill is so important. We need to have full accountability for the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission needs to have full powers and full independence from the Executive in this State. That would be in the best interests of the men and women who serve us in the Garda Síochána and all of our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297"> When this Government came into power, it said it would act as a trailblazer. We heard exciting speeches about a new day and a new Republic. In that context, it is outrageous that this Bill was rejected as it was by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, last night. If the Government wants to make clarifications or changes, that can be facilitated on Committee Stage. I think the Deputies who introduced this Bill have made an excellent contribution. All Bills can be strengthened and tweaked. If the Government is sincere about independence, political reform, the protection of citizens and the integrity of serving members of the Garda Síochána, it will accept this Bill and amend it as necessary. Of course we know that the Government has proven that it is failing in this regard. That is a serious disappointment to our people. Nonetheless, the Opposition will continue to advocate for change in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_1300">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill 2013. I compliment my colleagues on the Opposition benches who have introduced this Bill and given Deputies an opportunities to debate this subject. I honestly believe the Bill is premature, however, given that a review of the operations of the Garda Síochána will be held on foot of the Haddington Road agreement. Those conducting the review are to report back by 1 June 2014. I do not know what is to be feared from listening to what all the stakeholders, including the Garda Síochána, have to say on this matter. It is important for us to listen to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301"> As a public representative who came through the ranks at county council and Seanad Éireann levels before being elected to the Dáil, I cannot understand why we are so anxious to divest ourselves of power. Why do we want to place our accountability in the hands of a board? I would equate this to the decision to establish the HSE some years ago. The HSE was used by successive Ministers to hide from responsibility and accountability. I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle experienced this. The existence of the HSE allowed Ministers who did not want to come in here to answer parliamentary questions to say that the matters about which they were asked were the responsibility of the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302"> The establishment of another statutory board would be a retrograde step for us as public representatives. The necessary resources should be put into the services, statutory bodies and Garda structures that are in place at the moment, including the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. They should be beefed up and they should be accountable. The public has an opportunity every so often to decide on the fate of its public representatives, who should be held accountable for what goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303"> I passionately believe that the operation of the Garda Síochána should be a matter for the structures that are in place at present. I refer to the Garda Commissioner or chief executive officer, the deputy commissioner, the assistant commissioners, the chief superintendents, the superintendents, the local sergeants and the local gardaí. The only way to protect public confidence in the Garda Síochána, which is fundamental for the force, is to ensure the public and the elected representatives continue to have a relationship with the Garda Síochána and to have an opportunity to discuss matters with the Garda authorities as they arise. In a broad church like the Garda Síochána, which has over 13,300 members at present, there are bound to be difficulties and individuals who fall by the wayside. At the previous speaker said, the members of the force are people of the utmost calibre and the highest integrity, by and large. The gardaí themselves probably represent the best regulator the force can have.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304"> When we speak about public confidence in the Garda Síochána, it is worth noting that almost everyone in the general public has a family member - a brother, sister or cousin - or a close friend in the force. The Garda Síochána and the general public are a closely-knit community. The force has never been found wanting when somebody has fallen by the wayside. It has prosecuted its own members. While I accept that people have the right to complain, there needs to be a balance in this situation as well. Members of the force need to be protected. Many unsubstantiated claims have been made by the general public against the Garda for one reason or another. When these claims pile up, it takes some time to have them heard. Such delays can have a profound effect on the stature of the garda in question, on his work and on his health. We need to put in place a system that upholds the right of the general public to complain and ensures the person who makes the complaint is also held accountable. Perhaps some kind of bond system can be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305"> When the Minister for Justice and Equality visited the Garda College in Templemore during the week, I was delighted to hear him announce that recruitment to the college will recommence in the coming months. It is a testament to the attractiveness of the job of gardaí, and indeed to the level of public confidence in the force, that over 27,000 people have expressed an interest in joining the Garda Síochána. That figure is expected to increase twofold or threefold when newspaper advertisements are published because of the level of interest on the part of those who want to join the force. That is a testament to the confidence of the general public in the Garda Síochána. It is also an indication of how popular the job is, how keen people are to serve their country and how willing they are to protect the citizens of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306"> I would like to avail of this opportunity to acknowledge the role that has been played by members of the Garda Síochána based at the Garda College in Templemore. Many people were negative about the college while it was closed. They said it would never open again, or that this or that would happen. The management of the college provided various in-service and other courses to keep the college going over the last two or three years, which have been quite difficult. I could never see that happening if we had an independent body. It would probably have closed the place down until recruitment recommenced. I pay tribute to the chief superintendent who is in charge down there. I would also like to mention Assistant commissioner Fintan Fanning, who had direct responsibility for it. Chief Superintendent Clancy and Superintendent Pat Dunne in Templemore kept it going as well. Great credit is due to all of them. It augurs well for the future of the force that recruitment is recommencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307"> We can expect an intake of student gardaí into the Garda College in Templemore in early 2014. That will allay some of the concerns that have been expressed tonight. After spending 33 weeks in the college, those students will be attested and will become gardaí in their own right. When they are dispersed throughout the country, they will add to the ability of the Garda Síochána to deliver a service to the community, particularly in those rural areas about which we are so concerned. I look forward to that day. I remind the House that the Garda College in Templemore will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308"> I welcome the open debate on this Bill and the many suggestions that are being made. While I acknowledge the sincerity of Opposition Deputies, I believe it is premature of them to have introduced this Bill at this time. We should wait for the review to see what the people have said.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">It is also important to hear what members of An Garda Síochána have to say. The ultimate responsibility for the operations of An Garda Síochána should lie with the Garda management. It should not be subject to any board or, as the Opposition has noted, any political interference. The function of the Government is to provide the necessary budget to allow An Garda Síochána to operate effectively and efficiently. That is what we wish for.</p>

          <p eId="para_1311">I will begin my contribution by welcoming the fact that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence has lifted the ban on recruitment to An Garda Síochána. That is very significant not least for the reasons set out by Deputy Coonan such as the boost to the economy. It is also a very good boost for those of us who hold out hope for the restoration of the public finances. It is also a good testament to the reputation enjoyed by An Garda Síochána. A very good expression of public confidence in An Garda Síochána is the fact that over 27,000 people have expressed an interest in joining the force at this very difficult time in our country's history. I know the Minister has put on record that he does not want to see the force drop below 13,000, which is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312"> The purpose of this Bill is to strengthen the independence and functions of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. I wish to put on record that I reject the notion that the functions set out in the Garda Síochána Act 2005 require strengthening and I reject the implication of the Bill brought forward by colleagues on the other side of the House. We all know the genesis of the Garda Síochána Act. It arose out of the findings of the Morris Tribunal. While any incident of maltreatment is an incident too many, by and large, we have been served very well by members of An Garda Síochána and the force. I often think we need to enjoy comment in the hear and now as opposed to any angle that individuals or groups may wish to put on that. </p>
          <p eId="para_1313"> The Garda Síochána Act 2005 is without doubt the most profound legislation relating to the force in the history of the State. It was a catalyst and vehicle for the most fundamental reform and transformation of An Garda Síochána. It goes to the very core of policing, recasting in statute form the formal relationship between the Executive, the Minister, the Oireachtas and An Garda Síochána, as well as the force's relationship with local government. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 established the independent Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, and the Garda Síochána Inspectorate, which provides expert advice on achieving the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness in the operation and administration of the force. The GSOC is independent and is responsible for receiving and dealing with all complaints made by members of the public concerning the conduct of members of the Garda Síochána. These are significant steps forward in terms of police oversight and an important step in mainstreaming human rights in Irish policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314"> In addition to the Minister being answerable in Dáil Éireann for the Garda Síochána, the 2005 Act also made the Garda Commissioner the Accounting Officer for the Garda Síochána and liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. When I served on that committee up until before the Christmas recess, the Garda Commissioner and assistant commissioners appeared before it. While one could argue that it is an accounting role and the Committee of Public Accounts is concerned with expenditure by the force, we invariably would go into issues like policing. I have always found Commissioner Callinan and his team to be very engaging and anxious to constructively interact with Members of the Oireachtas through that forum. </p>
          <p eId="para_1315"> The powers available to GSOC are very wide ranging and sufficient to ensure that it is well equipped to investigate allegations of criminal misconduct and or alleged breaches of discipline. I wish to make a very important point. GSOC came into effect in 2007 and has dealt with over 2,600 complaints since then. Some of them are vexatious and we should never forget that. If anything needs expansion, it is the role of GSOC in terms of reports it receives of incidents. Approximately 80% of those are referred back to An Garda Síochána to investigate. If anything needs improvement, it is the role of GSOC in terms of how it approaches all allegations. I believe it should investigate all of them. </p>
          <p eId="para_1316"> We do not need to be on a collision course with any other arm of the State. In terms of conducting public debate about An Garda Síochána, we need to leave any baggage outside the door and come to this with the best possible objective, which is to have an effective, properly resourced and efficient police service. That is very important in the current climate. I pay tribute to the Minister for the manner in which he has resourced the force in very difficult economic circumstances and the manner in which he has interacted constructively with the management of An Garda Síochána in order to ensure that we get no less than what we are entitled to, which is an effective and efficient police force which does a very effective and efficient job. </p>

          <p eId="para_1317">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It is important that we look at concerns gardaí have in respect of GSOC and I wish to put their concerns on the record. I am speaking for rank-and-file gardaí at the coalface instead of those up along the line, namely, the officers. The main body which represents this organisation is the Garda Representative Association which has repeatedly welcomed independent and impartial investigation of complaints relating to their members. However, the GSOC has failed to establish trust with the gardaí at the coalface. We must also take into account that there is a difficulty relating to the trust the Garda on the beat has in that organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318"> Why do members not trust the impartiality and fairness of investigations by the GSOC? I am not saying they are unfair or not impartial but why is the trust in their fairness and impartiality not there? Why is the GSOC concerned about a Garda attending with their lawyer present? Surely they have the same rights as any citizen under scrutiny in a criminal investigation? Not all of these investigations are criminal ones. Why is the GSOC concerned because surely every citizen has the right to be represented? Why are there no sanctions for those who make vexatious and malicious statements and accusations regarding members of An Garda Síochána operating at the coalface? The pressure on somebody waiting for a consideration of their position, their status within the organisation and their well-being in having to face this situation is quite serious so surely there should be some way of identifying or dealing with people who make proven vexatious and malicious complaints against individual gardaí. Will the Minister respond to the Garda Representative Association's request for a full investigation by an external agency to restore confidence within the Garda? </p>
          <p eId="para_1319"> The most common complaints refer to discourtesy or abuse of authority by gardaí. Surely an informal approach should be used to restore that situation? If that does not work, one can go back to the formal situation rather than blocking up the system. We need to restore trust between the Garda and the GSOC. </p>

          <p eId="para_1320">I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I thank the Opposition for bringing forward the Bill, which gives us a chance to reflect on the contribution of An Garda Síochána and all that is good about it even though there may be some elements in it that are not so good. It is right and proper that we reflect on this in the national Parliament, and on the legacy of An Garda Síochána since its establishment in the State and how it has served our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321"> On the first day they are commissioned gardaí take an oath to lay down their lives in the protection of the State and its citizens. This does not come lightly and it should be publicly acknowledged by all public representatives that young gardaí train with good intentions to take up a career which, in my opinion, goes beyond a normal vocation to serve the people of the country. Since its establishment in the State, the Garda Síochána has gone through some very difficult times. During the Troubles the Garda Síochána, which is one of the only unarmed police forces in the world, stood foursquare in protection of our citizens against terrorism and subversion-----</p>

          <p eId="para_1323">-----and worked in the best interests of the State. It is very important to acknowledge this at the outset of any debate on this matter. The Garda has earned respect over many years through how it engages with communities and protects our citizens. It now faces very difficult modern challenges due to changes in technology. With drug lords, warlords and global terrorism, new challenges face the Garda Síochána and the State. We must be properly conscious of them and the force should be properly resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324"> I understand the reason the Bill has been tabled, which is to try to separate the accountability of senior-ranking gardaí from the political process. While I understand the good intention behind the Bill, I have difficulties with it because, ultimately, any national agency or organisation should be accountable to Dáil Éireann and the people elected to it. Through the House the Minister for Justice and Equality is accountable for all actions under his or her control, including the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 ensures the Garda Commissioner is accountable to the Committee on Public Accounts with regard to how the Garda Síochána is run as an organisation. This is where accountability should remain. The joint policing committees are effectual to a degree, and I also acknowledge the engagement at local level of senior gardaí, but the potential exists to further this process to ensure local accountability from the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325"> I listened to the debate yesterday, and there is no doubt that, like any organisation, the Garda has corrupt individuals. We have seen in the past that individuals in the Garda Síochána have abused their positions and have been found to be guilty of various levels of corruption and activities which ill behove the force. I do not agree with making broad allegations of corruption without foundation. Gardaí are subject to the rigours of the law and the courts just as Deputies and other citizens are. I would be very surprised to hear, in cases in which gardaí have acted inappropriately or in a criminal fashion, that they were not brought before the courts. If there are cover-ups, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission provides an opportunity to address them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326"> I support what Deputy Neville stated about building trust in the work of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. The nature of the Garda Síochána brings individuals into conflict in the line of their work and increases the risk of vexatious complaints. It is important that we have an accountable and trustworthy system through the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327"> With regard to restructuring Garda resources, we have heard many complaints from people concerned about rural communities. I have met chief superintendents and superintendents in my constituency who have engaged with communities on how they are restructuring their operations. Some rural Garda stations have closed, but if we are to be honest, many of them were essentially closed anyway, with gardaí visiting them for very short periods. The new systems being introduced, with the support of communities, can lead to a more effective police force in these areas with higher visibility and more operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328"> I will not support the Bill. I wish again to put on the record my full support, respect and appreciation for the Garda Síochána and for the service it has given the State. There are appropriate accountability mechanisms for people with complaints to bring them before the House, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the courts.</p>

          <from>Deputy Helen McEntee<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1329">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I thank the Opposition for tabling it. I have a number of issues with the Bill. Having listened to contributions made on all sides of the House to the debate yesterday, and what followed this morning in the media at local and national level, it is safe to say that what I took from it, and what I can only presume people outside the House took from it, was an attack on the Garda Síochána, the Government and the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330"> The apparent aim of the Bill is to establish an independent board that would have general oversight of the Garda Síochána, that would take over many of the existing functions of the Minister and the Government, and that in doing so would improve the democratic accountability of the Garda Síochána. I do not believe the Bill would achieve its stated aim. Changing the functions of the Garda Commissioner, along with deleting the statutory provisions that make the Garda Commissioner accountable to the Minister for Justice and Equality, would not improve accountability; in fact, it would cut essential links between different bodies of our workforce. The Minister for Justice and Equality is accountable to the House and it would be wrong to take this away from a democratically elected House of Parliament. I have every confidence in the Garda Síochána and commend gardaí on the work they carry out on a daily basis. They have taken hits and pay cuts like everybody else, and they have carried out their duties in a dignified and excellent manner. Whether it was meant to or not, what emerged from last night's debate was extremely unfair to members of the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331"> I welcome the announcement by the Minister earlier this week that he has received sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to begin the process of recruiting gardaí. At present we have just over 13,000 gardaí working to protect the citizens of Ireland. As has been mentioned, 27,000 people have expressed an interest in joining the force, so I have every confidence those in Templemore next year will be of the highest standard. This will be the first new set of recruits since 2009 and there was no way we could have gone this length of time without some areas being affected. The average time for Garda clearance or vetting is 12 to 14 weeks, and I can only assume this is due to the low number of gardaí available to deal with the process. Not too long ago I spoke to a friend who runs a surf school and water activity centre in the North of Ireland. Many such centres begin their season at the beginning of summer and in a perfect world they would have hired their employees before then, but this is not always the case as people leave, get sick or move on. Unfortunately, the length of the summer recess is 12 to 14 weeks, so any business working with children and young adults will face delays. Community employment schemes, JobBridge, Tús and the local government social employment scheme are also behind their targets by more than 50% with regard to the number of people on the schemes, and this is due to the delay in Garda vetting and clearance. This problem affects not only businesses but also those trying to return to work. I suggest to the Minister of State that a proportion of the new recruits could be specifically assigned to deal with this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332"> An Garda Síochána provides an invaluable service to the people of Ireland and it would be detrimental to everybody involved if we were to dismantle the system under which it works, because it works very well and has been strengthened by the 2005 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">Instead of establishing a board to carry out the work that is already being carried out by the Government, the Minister and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, we must focus on providing resources for the Garda and continue to invest in new recruits. We must support and respect the Garda Síochána. For that reason I will not support the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1335">I commend Deputy Wallace and his staff for their work in preparing the legislation we are debating tonight – The Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill. It is a worthwhile and timely legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336"> I have been listening to the debate over the past two nights and it has been interesting how many Deputies have prefaced their remarks by stating how many good gardaí there are and how many work hard and do their best in a very difficult situation. There is no doubt that is true and that a significant number of gardaí are doing their work. However, it signals the power of the Garda in society when we feel it necessary to preface our remarks by saying something of that nature. That goes to the heart of what this legislation is about and the purpose that it aims to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337"> I heard some speakers refer to the amount of unsubstantiated claims against gardaí and how unfair it is that this is the situation. There is no doubt that is the case. However, it is a sign of the difficulty involved in ensuring complaints are investigated. If complaints are unsubstantiated then that must be clearly stated and where necessary answers should be sought. That again shows the issues of accountability that arise with the Garda Síochána as an organisation and the culture that can develop within it. As I look across the Chamber I am reminded that if we give people unrestricted and unaccountable power then we get abuses of it. It is not right that we would allow that to continue in a democratic society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338"> While there might be unsubstantiated claims against gardaí, many families around the country are very worried by what has happened to them. Serious wrongs were perpetrated against them. They have lost loved ones and they have not been able to get answers. Officialdom in society closes down when people begin to ask questions. Families are left on their own for long periods trying to get answers. That is not right. It is not good for the culture of the Garda and it is not good for society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339"> I wish to mention the family of Shane Tuohy, a case in which I had some involvement. They are in the Visitors Gallery tonight. They lost their son Shane in very tragic circumstances in County Offaly. I looked at the case and the official account does not reflect how Shane died. That is a wrong that continues to be perpetrated against the family. We need a mechanism to allow for such wrongs to be investigated and for answers to be provided to families around the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1341">The legislation is about accountability and proving accountability. We have heard how the Garda Síochána Act came about as a result of the Morris tribunal and investigations that were carried out by Mr. Justice Morris in my county of Donegal. The interesting point about the tribunal is how the subsequent narrative confined the problem to Donegal. The view was that it was only in Donegal that such things were happening and that up there we are different and things go wrong. That was the narrative that was propagated by officialdom and by those with the power to make things happen. Families around the country could relate similar issues to what happened in Donegal to which they never been able to get answers or that have never been properly investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342"> The key issue relates to giving an organisation too much power. If any one of us in this House were given unlimited power the tendency would be to abuse it. That is natural. We must all be accountable and be held accountable. That is the objective of the Bill. The Bill provides for the setting up of a Garda Síochána independent board with the task of promoting respect for human rights within the Garda Síochána. That is something we should have across society. Departments should work on the same basis of respecting the human rights of all citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343"> The Bill seeks, rightly, to strengthen the power and independence of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. That should have been the case from the outset without having to introduce amending legislation to make it happen. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission should be able to initiate its own investigations. It is vitally important that serving gardaí should not form part of the commission’s investigative staff. The commission should also have mandatory supervision of gardaí investigating themselves. That cannot continue. All the good gardaí who are working hard and doing their best to serve their communities deserve that, as well as the citizens of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_1344">I too am pleased to speak on the Garda Síochána (Amendment) Bill. In deference to my colleague, Deputy Pringle, I will salute the bravery of the vast majority of gardaí for their integrity since the foundation of the State. I too have had some bad experiences. I could be bitter but I will not tarnish the entire force because of the actions, in my case, of one or two rotten apples. There are many rotten apples but it is a minority of the 13,000 strong force. That is the magic number we have now. I seek clarification from the Minister on whether the total strength includes the Garda Reserve. I believe it does.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345"> I welcome the re-opening of Templemore but this is the second time the Minister has made such an announcement. He revised the original re-opening due to either the Haddington Road agreement or Croke Park II, I do not know which it was. The Minister cannot play politics with the issue. I want Templemore to be opened because it has been closed since 2009. We do not know the size of the intake in 2014 but it will be 2017 before the new recruits are out on the street.</p>

          <p eId="para_1347">We have a serious situation. I salute the Garda Reserve who give their time. They should be given the first chance to become recruited to the Garda Síochána if they are suitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348"> The Garda Representative Association, GRA, has repeatedly called for impartiality in investigations. No one is hiding in that regard. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and its forerunner, with which I was involved, must restore trust with the Garda and people. I have seen on television that when a garda is involved in an accident in some cases a helicopter flies members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to investigate. I accept there must be independence but I question the resources that are put into the commission. The investigations must be carried out in a proper manner. We must examine the situation. The Garda must be investigated by an independent body. The GRA has asked for that. However, when we see cases such as those of the late Fr. Niall Molloy and Shane Tuohy they spoil the whole atmosphere for the rest of the good gardaí. I have seen gardaí being abused at the front gate trying to protect us in this House from people who want anarchy on the streets. I salute the Garda and I support it. I have been involved in the community alert initiative all my life. A police force cannot operate without the support of the public. We must build trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349"> I am not a reckless person. I asked questions some months ago of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, about an incident when he was stopped at a checkpoint on Pembroke Street between February and early March 2011. He responded about incidents in 2008 and 2009. I inquired whether he was cautioned on that occasion by gardaí at a checkpoint under the Road Traffic Acts, which he was, and whether the gardaí on that occasion used their discretion. It was a simple question but he did not answer it. I asked whether he was asked to produce a specimen of breath under the mandatory breath testing provisions contained in the Road Traffic Act 2010. He did not fully answer the question. I also asked whether his behaviour and reaction to the request was appropriate and cordial. There was no answer. I further asked whether he attempted to use the privilege of travelling to the Dáil as a means of avoiding giving a breath test. The issue was not clarified. I inquired whether he did give a specimen of breath. According to legal advice I received, a failure to do so is the same as a refusal. The Minister did fail to do so. I asked the Tánaiste whether he would, in the public interest, and to facilitate greater transparency, immediately publish the Garda report which exists into the incident that took place in late February, early March 2011.</p>

We must have trust in the Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality, which we do not have. The Minister has treated the Garda with total disdain on many occasions. He was not invited to the conference. He did not allow gardaí to use facilities at his house. That has never happened before. These are not wild claims; they are facts on which I have corroborative proof. The report exists if the Minister wants to find it. The Garda will not find it if it looks in the reports for 2008 or 2009. The incident in question happened between late February and early March 2011. The Minister should cut out the tomfoolery and be honest. He should be upfront and answer the questions, not hide and then spend the past three weeks on national television and radio and other shows promoting his book, if one does not mind, and telling the presenter that it was not “Prime Time” and he would not answer questions other than on the book.</p>

It is time the Minister - or the Taoiseach who appointed him - entered the House and answered the questions he is expected to answer as Minister for Justice and Equality, the highest office in the land. We must have faith and confidence in him, but we do not.</p>

          <p eId="para_1365">I would be loth to stand here and making sweeping statements alleging Garda corruption and collusion, particularly at a time when many excellent and hard-working gardaí whom I know are demoralised by their work. They have suffered cuts to their wages and dramatic changes to their job descriptions. That there has been no recruitment for several years has crippled the force. One hundred Garda stations will be closed by the end of the year, resources are stretched and not enough importance is being placed on the brave work being done by gardaí on a daily basis. For example, only two Garda units - the domestic violence and sexual assault unit and the computer crime investigative unit - have access to counselling sessions. This is wrong. All members who suffer from stress or depression as a result of dealing with traumatic cases should have access to counsellors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366"> The fact that just four in ten cases are being dealt with or investigated by the Garda ombudsman, coupled with the worrying impediments that are being placed in the commission's way, makes it clear that action is needed urgently. Crime is demoralising people, terrifying the elderly and destroying the lives of many young people. To tackle this crime, we need an efficient and effective Garda force operating with the full confidence, support and co-operation of the population it serves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367"> The Bill proposes a greater role for community feedback in policing. Without Garda accountability, this Bill will only be a pipe dream. It should be supported. Last month, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission released a damning report about an incident in my constituency of Waterford. It claimed that members of the force had not co-operated with its investigation and refused to supply information when requested. The commission was investigating claims that a 38-year-old man had been badly beaten and kicked in the head by the gardaí who arrested him. Two former members of the force were later found guilty of the assault and another was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by moving CCTV cameras while the assault was occurring. The ombudsman claimed that its investigation had been hampered by the lack of support from some gardaí, particularly when it came to supplying necessary documentation. To compound this issue further, the document was later produced in the course of the trial by the defence for certain of the accused. This is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368"> Nor is this an isolated incident. The ombudsman has highlighted cases in which repeated reminders - 18 in just one case - needed to be sent to Garda stations requesting information during various investigations. In one instance, it took 136 days for information to be provided after a request was made. Often, the relevance of a request is questioned before materials are released. This is unacceptable. I am told that some officers are routinely unwilling to take part even in informal attempts to resolve complaints made against them. It is almost as if a small number of gardaí take insult at being asked to account for themselves. How can the Minister stand over a situation in which gardaí are attending meetings with the ombudsman with nothing to say for themselves? This is on record - no comment, no comment, no comment. This is a matter of serious concern for us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369"> Seven years after the Morris tribunal, we are still awaiting the recommended overhaul of the force. We need to reassure the public that senior officers will ensure that all gardaí co-operate with the ombudsman's office promptly. Otherwise, what kind of signal will we send people? The situation needs to be addressed from the top down. Funnily enough, when I showed the Bill to some gardaí, they had no problem with it. Gardaí on the ground have no problem with accountability. This is what we should be aiming for. The Bill goes a long way towards restoring people's confidence, which is badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370"> I started my contribution by complimenting the good gardaí across the country who are doing their best for people. They do not want to be under investigation because of incidents that they find unacceptable. Were this Bill presented to ordinary gardaí on the ground, superintendents and sergeants who work for and in the community, they would find it acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_1371">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to contribute on this new legislation. I welcome the Bill, as it is progressive, fair and sensible. Speaking as a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I believe the Bill is a clear path towards ensuring fairness, equality and justice for all citizens. For this reason, I will vote in favour of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372"> The Bill is concerned with truth and the importance of fairly implementing the laws made in the Houses. Sadly, we have all seen the law abused and many miscarriages of justice. We cannot turn our backs on these cases. We cannot turn our backs on these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373"> A number of Deputies referred to the issue of trust in and respect for An Garda Síochána. Where I come from, one earns trust and respect. This is the bottom line regardless of whether one is a garda, a teacher, a councillor or a Deputy. On the north side of Dublin, one earns respect by working in the community. It is important that we say this in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374"> The legislation seeks to strengthen the independence and impartiality of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and to establish a Garda Síochána independent board with monitoring, supervisory and oversight functions in respect of the Garda Síochána. This is a sensible proposal. What is wrong with it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1375"> Yesterday, I attended a meeting of five victims of Garda malpractice and a lack of Garda accountability. These are real people. Ms Margaret Delaney and Mr. Billy Ryan claim Garda harassment, but their case was deemed inadmissible for investigation by the ombudsman, as no breach of the disciplinary code had occurred. Mr. Eamon Tuohey claims there was an inadequate investigation into the death of his son. Dr. Richard O'Flaherty witnessed interference in cases and Garda harassment in Limerick. He is a Limerick doctor. Mrs. Nuala Ramseyer claims there was an inadequate investigation into the death of her brother. These are all real cases. They are decent and genuine people. It is important to point out that this Bill is about developing good policing, not about the dedicated and genuinely good gardaí who serve their communities and their country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376"> Members of my family have served in the Garda. Many relations and friends still serve there. I will not take any lecture from the Minister for Justice and Equality about being anti-Garda. I will not take a lecture from any member of the Government. This Bill is about setting standards, about honest, high-quality policing and, above all, about accountability, which is the key word in this debate. At all times, we need high-quality and honest policing. The majority of gardaí provide it. However, it is important that safeguards against bad, dishonest and corrupt policing be in place. That is what the Bill is about. Why are Government backbenchers and Ministers losing the bottle to support it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1377"> I wish to highlight another example of corrupt policing. I raise the case of Mr. James Sheehan of West Commons, Ardfert, County Kerry, whom I met recently again. He was arrested on 17 August 1989 under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act. A gun was allegedly found in his car, which had been driven by a garda to Tralee Garda station. It was alleged that the gun was found in the dashboard. In a subsequent search of his house, a number of bullets-----</p>

I have met him and I believe him 100%. The DPP also believed him, the charges were dropped and he was cleared. However, when he went to push this blatant set-up further and clear his name, the gun disappeared from Garda protection. Why? He endeavoured to vindicate his name, yet untruths and barriers were put in front of him by some gardaí. He is still suffering today and his family are also suffering, particularly when they want to travel through airports on holidays. His nightmare continues yet nobody listened to his claim that the gun was planted. This is a really sad, true story, yet the silence is deafening. </p>
          <p eId="para_1383"> I will continue to fight Mr. James Sheehan's case until the truth comes out and he gets justice. This case is at the core of this legislation.

          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1384">I commend Deputy Wallace on bringing forward this important legislation. The Bill will, no doubt, be voted down later on this evening by the Government. However, it puts in place a template for best international practice, which will be acted upon in the not too distant future. It is worthwhile reminding ourselves that many of the provisions in the Bill before us have been recommended in reports and papers published by the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Irish Human Rights Commission, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Combat Poverty Agency, the Fr. Peter McVerry Trust, Social Justice Ireland, the Morris tribunal, the Patten report and various other groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385"> These are well known and well respected bodies and individuals who have contributed to drawing up this legislation. The Bill sets out best practice and will, hopefully, be acted upon in the not too distant future and put into operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386"> Many cases of malpractice have been instanced in the course of this debate. There is no doubt that many such cases exist. Yesterday, we met some of the individuals concerned in the audio-visual room of Leinster House. I am currently dealing with three cases of malpractice and it is quite clear that there are such cases throughout the country. We have also had the Morris tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387"> Even if there was never an allegation of malpractice against one Garda, this Bill represents the most sensible and fairest way of operating the Garda Síochána in a democratic state. The Patten report in the North of Ireland set out what is international best practice. To a large extent, this Bill follows that report's parameters. </p>
          <p eId="para_1388"> I support the introduction of a Garda Síochána independent board, which would be an important step in strengthening the democratic accountability of An Garda Síochána. In addition, it would ensure that there would be trust in the force and its membership. It would lead to policing by consent, and community policing, throughout the country. That is a key element in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389"> It was stated earlier that the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, or GSOC, was an important milestone in dealing with complaints when it was introduced. It might well have been, but in recent times it is clear that the commission is certainly suffering from a lack of co-operation from the Garda Síochána. I would go so far as to say that the commission is suffering from obstruction by Garda management. There is obviously a need to ensure that we have a fully independent Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission that has full authority to act and is not being obstructed by Garda management.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390"> The relevant section of the Bill will deal with that question by widening the admissibility of the criteria for complaints. It will also require mandatory supervision of all investigations by that office, rather than the current system whereby 40% of complaints are investigated by gardaí themselves. In addition, it would prohibit serving gardaí from forming part of the GSOC's staff. The latter two points are very important. We simply cannot have gardaí investigating themselves. It would not work for any other profession either. It simply does not work and it is quite clear from the recent report by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission that it is not working and needs to be changed. </p>
          <p eId="para_1391"> This Bill will bring about such change. I would hope that, even at this late stage, the Minister and the Government would accept the Bill and afford it a further reading. It could be amended, if necessary, as it proceeds through the House. I confirm my support for the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1392">Ba mhaith liom tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille agus aitheantas a thabhairt do na Teachtaí Dála de réir na hoibre iontach a rinne siad ionas go mbeadh an Bille os ár gcomhair, go háirithe an obair a rinne an Teachta Dála Wallace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393"> In the Chamber yesterday, I heard the opening speeches from Deputies Mick Wallace, Clare Daly and Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, who along with Deputy Joan Collins, have done most of the work to bring this Bill before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394"> At the end of the Minister's speech, however, I had to ask myself if the people in the Visitors Gallery, who had issues in the area, were reassured by what he said. In recent years, I have attended countless meetings and briefings that were distressing and disturbing. They generally concerned injustices that had been allowed to continue for many years. I also attended the meeting in the audio-visual room yesterday. I listened, appalled, to the stories by people who had had experiences with gardaí because of particular incidents involving members of their families, and their efforts to get answers, information and justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395"> Their encounters with the system, including gardaí and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, did not leave them feeling that their voices were heard, the issues were addressed or that justice had been achieved. Their stories were of Garda investigations being well below professional standards, shortcomings in Garda conduct and families forced to go to court - even to the Supreme Court - at considerable expense, in order to get information. They were simply seeking answers to genuine queries about what had happened to them or their loved ones. They have been treated very badly over quite a number of years. </p>
          <p eId="para_1396"> It was horrific to listen to these people talking about harassment, gardaí not identifying themselves, inappropriate searches, false accusations and cover-ups. Some of this harassment, which went on in front of children, was because of what was described as collusion between certain local influential people and gardaí in the area. It was all basically impeding the course of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397"> We saw what happened in Donegal but it has certainly spread to other areas. I have been involved in one particular incident, trying to get information for a family in the inner city whose son was murdered. He was a criminal but he was their son and, like any parents, they are entitled to answers about what happened to him. So far, I have written to the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Chief Superintendent, but I am still waiting for answers. The family have also been waiting for a number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1398"> The Minister of State seems to have so much confidence in the current system, which she has outlined. The Minister is answerable to the Dáil for the Garda Síochána. The Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Síochána and in that capacity is liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. Whether that is supposed to inspire confidence, I am not too sure. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission will carry out independent investigations into Garda conduct and the Garda Síochána inspectorate. However, that system has not worked for the people who told their stories yesterday. Neither did it work for Dr. O'Flaherty or the family of Fr. Niall Molloy. In their case, they have been waiting for over 30 years. </p>
          <p eId="para_1399"> We need impartiality, transparency and democratic accountability. Some 15 or 20 years ago, there was a very fractured relationship between the gardaí and communities in the inner city. There was no trust in the gardaí and there were serious shortcomings in their responses to crime. The gardaí then had to demonstrate that they were prepared to be responsive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1400">Out of that initiative, led by the late Tony Gregory, came the community policing forum, which comprises a co-ordinator and two other staff who organise meetings at which gardaí have to address the issues brought to them by the community. The issues raised range from crime to drug dealing and anti-social behaviour. The forum also provides for meetings held in confidential settings aided by the staff, at which gardaí must answer questions. This has led to trust in the Garda Síochána by the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1401"> What is proposed in this Bill is in the best interests of those hard-working, honourable gardaí who are equally appalled at what has been going on in certain sections.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_494">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1402">It has been an interesting debate. While I do not propose to recap on all the issues raised by the Minister, the model proposed in the Bill does not have due regard to the existence of a national police force in this jurisdiction which is not only the police service but the security and intelligence service and border control authority of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403"> In his opposition to the Bill, the Minister voiced the concern that the proposal to transfer key oversight functions of the Garda Síochána to a separate unelected body would not improve the democratic accountability of the force. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides that the Garda Commissioner is accountable to the Minister in the performance of his or her functions and those of the force and the Minister, in turn, is accountable to this House. As Accounting Officer for the force, the Commissioner is also liable to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. </p>
          <p eId="para_1404"> It is noteworthy that the UK is moving away from the type of structure proposed in the Bill to systems aimed at more democratic accountability linked to elected representatives, in tandem of course with an independent body to investigate allegations of misconduct. The Bill also calls for enhanced Garda measures on human rights. It is indeed appropriate that we debate Garda responsibilities on human rights and the policies developed to meet these. There have been a number of developments within An Garda Síochána in recent years designed to put regard for human rights at the core of policing in Ireland. A function of the Garda Síochána under section 7 of the 2005 Act is to vindicate the human rights of each individual. Arising from this requirement, all Garda policy is drafted in accordance with human rights principles and all operational Garda directives now make reference to the relevant human rights principles. Accordingly, the application of human rights is a core objective of the force. This work is supported by advice from the Garda Síochána strategic human rights committee, membership of which includes NGO experts in human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1405"> The Bill seeks an enhanced role for the joint policing committees. A number of Deputies brought their own personal and positive experience of these committees to the fore in their contributions on the Bill. My experience in this regard has also been positive. The Minister awaits the outcome of the review of the JPCs which is under way. I expect that we can look forward to improved operating guidelines for JPCs, providing, in particular, for an enhanced communication role at local and national levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1406"> In presenting the Bill, some Deputies referred to whistleblowing provisions for members of the Garda Síochána. As members will be aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment to enhance whistleblowing provisions. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently published the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013, which provides for robust protection to whistleblowing employees generally across the public and private sectors. Section 19 of that Bill provides for the making of regulations relating to protected disclosures by members of the Garda Síochána. This provision provides for enhanced procedures for members of the Garda Síochána who wish to raise matters of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1407"> I would like to comment on two issues in the Bill. First, a number of Deputies commented that certain forms of harm, including torture and rape, are not covered under section 102 of the 2005 Act. Section 102 requires the Garda Commissioner to refer to the Ombudsman Commission any matter in which it appears the behaviour of a member may have resulted in the death of, or serious harm to, a person. The term "serious harm" is comprehensively defined. It is important to understand that this is an automatic referral mechanism. In other words, the Commissioner does not have to decide whether any wrongdoing might be involved. For example, a death arising from a straightforward car accident would be covered under this provision. The scenarios outlined by some Deputies, concerning incidents of torture or rape, are of an entirely different order and would fall to be investigated as serious criminal allegations. In this regard, the other provisions of the Act relating to the Ombudsman Commission would be relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408"> Second, the Bill seeks the extension, from six months to one year, in the time within which complaints must be made to the Ombudsman Commission. Section 84(2) of the 2005 Act provides that the Ombudsman Commission may extend the time limit if it considers there are good reasons for so doing. For practical reasons, including the public interest in investigating incidents as soon as possible, there must be a reasonable timeframe within which a complaint can be made. It is also the case that proposals from the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission for amendments to Part 4 of the 2005 Act are under consideration and these proposals are the starting point for any revision to its oversight role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409"> I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on the Bill. I agree with the Minister's acknowledgement yesterday of the genuine objectives behind the Bill but conclude that the Bill cannot, for the reasons stated during the debate, be supported.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_495">
          <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1410">Everybody is on the side of the Garda Síochána and wants to see an efficient, honest and honourable force. Nobody is disputing that. The problem as outlined in this Bill is not what is happening in the middle or on the ground but at the top. The authors of this Bill are seeking to tackle the principles of political appointments and self-regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1411"> The Minister of State rightly pointed out that methods of accountability are already in place. The problem is they are not working efficiently and leave an enormous amount of room for public doubt about what is happening at the top of the Garda Síochána. I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts to which the Minister of State referred. When the Commissioner appeared before that committee in early May, his performance was lamentable. He refused to answer questions put to him. When asked the real questions, he dived for cover. When he was asked about what the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, had found about the treatment by gardaí of informants and breaches of Garda Síochána guidelines, he said he did not wish to talk about those issues. The Committee of Public Accounts does not effectively manage to illicit from the Garda Síochána the information that is necessary solely because it refuses to give it. The Garda Síochána is not accountable in part because the committee does not push issues hard enough and because those at the top are politically appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1412"> That the Commissioner or anybody at the top of the Garda Síochána should be politically appointed is wrong. It means that such persons are in the hands of a Government which may ask them to do things which are either improper or politically motivated. It would be far better if, as provided for in this Bill, the appointment of the Commissioner and regulation of the Garda Síochána was changed. The Commissioner should be appointed by other means, although I do not agree with the formula proposed in that regard in the Bill. However, it should be done in manner that is detached from political appointments so that the Garda Síochána is not politicised at the top. The Garda Síochána has always been over-politicised at the top and we have had accidents here as a result. I am not suggesting that this Government is behaving improperly or doing anything improper. However, it is important we legislate to ensure future Governments cannot behave in that way. This Bill offers a possible model for appointment of a Garda Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413"> The second issue is self regulation, which was exposed by the penalty points investigation. I do not propose to run over any old sores. The GSOC was involved in two parallel investigations, namely, the penalty points investigation and investigation into another matter. The penalty points investigation, which by and large exonerated the Garda Síochána, was an internal inquiry by a garda appointed by the Commissioner. When the Commissioner was questioned about this at the Committee of Public Accounts his response was that he decided the garda concerned was a man of integrity. That is the problem: such matters should not be decided by the Commissioner. The appointment of that internal investigator should not have been made by the Commissioner. The other investigation going at the time was an inquiry being carried out by the Garda Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414">It took four years to complete because senior gardaí delayed, procrastinated and refused to issue documents to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. The external inquiry then issued an excoriating report about what was happening at the top of the Garda, while the internal inquiry by and large exonerated the Garda and found that three gardaí had questions to answer. This is not satisfactory as it indicates that self-regulation, that is, the appointment of gardaí internally, leads to one outcome, while independent oversight leads to another outcome. It also indicates that the Garda is prepared to delay and obstruct when it is not in its interests for an external inquiry to find out what is going on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1415"> I welcome the Bill because greater accountability and freedom of information are long overdue. We must end political appointments of members of the Garda and Judiciary. This Bill is a first step in that direction.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_496">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1416">I am extremely disappointed by the Government's response to this considered and well-drafted Bill which deals with very important issues. Deputy Wallace and his staff did a great deal of work on the legislation. More important, as the Deputy will agree, I salute those who are present in numbers in the Gallery, in particular those who gave testimony about the issues they face. I take offence at statements to the effect that nothing is being done to address Garda corruption at certain levels. The people in the Gallery travelled to Dublin to give testimony and relate what is happening in their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417"> The Minister referred to measures to promote human rights and inform members of the Garda of their responsibilities and noted the establishment of a committee to advise senior Garda management. What mechanism is in place to ensure citizens' human rights are not breached and to deal with complaints made by members of the public? We need a well-resourced, independent body to investigate such complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_1418"> I refer to the death some years ago in my constituency of a 21 year old man who had been held in Rathfarnham Garda station and was later found in a coma in a nearby estate. While I do not know what happened to the young man in question - an open verdict was returned at his inquest - I am aware that the internal Garda investigation did not answer serious questions arising from the case. For example, why was a person being held in a Garda station while awaiting transfer to a second Garda station suddenly released? The family of the dead man could not obtain answers about what had taken place and were treated with what can only be described as contempt. They were not afforded any rights and were subject to cruel and organised harassment by members of the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419"> The suggestion that gardaí should investigate other gardaí is not acceptable, as the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled in the Govell <i>v.</i> UK case. In its findings, the court held that police investigating complaints against police officers, where the complaint suggests a breach of a right under the European Convention on Human Rights, is a breach of Article 13 of the convention providing a right to an effective remedy. The measures in the Bill would remedy this issue by widening the criteria that apply in respect of time limits and including breaches of the new code of service. Currently, only 40% of complaints are deemed admissible. Of these, 40% are investigated by gardaí without supervision by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. Under the Bill, complaints could only be referred to gardaí with the consent of the complainant. The key issue is that gardaí and retired gardaí should not be involved in the investigation of complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420"> The Minister stated the Bill had two main objectives, namely, to strengthen the independence of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and establish a Garda Síochána independent police board. The third objective of the Bill is to increase Garda autonomy and its independence from central Government, direct ministerial control and political influence. In pointing out that the Garda has responsibility for State security as well as civil policy, the Minister makes an argument for greater accountability and the dilution of political control of the police force.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421"> In 2001, while in opposition, the Labour Party introduced a Bill which called for an independent policing strategy. The current Ministers and then Deputies Eamon Gilmore, Brendan Howlin and Pat Rabbitte fully supported the legislation, arguing that ministerial power over the Garda was excessive, while the then Deputy Alan Shatter argued for greater democratic accountability. Why are they now throwing their hands in the air and arguing that they cannot do anything?</p>
          <p eId="para_1422"> The reforms proposed in the Bill are crucial if we are to ensure the highest standards are maintained in the Garda Síochána and there is confidence in the impartiality of the law. The policing service is certainly not corrupt by international standards. The purpose of the legislation is not to undermine the Garda but to ensure high policing standards are maintained in all circumstances. If, on occasion, these standards are not maintained, effective redress must be provided for those affected. This is the objective of the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_497">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1423">Speaking yesterday, the Minister failed to acknowledge or address the third objective of the Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum, namely, to reduce ministerial control and political influence over the Garda Síochána. He emphasised his view that because the Garda is responsible for State security and law enforcement, he could not risk the proposed board being involved in policing. On the contrary, it is precisely because of the excessive concentration and centralisation of power in the hands of the Garda and Government that the proposed board and restructuring are necessary. This Bill will help to ensure excessive or unaccountable power over the police is not concentrated in the hands of party politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_1424"> The Minister also proposed that oversight and accountability were already adequately provided for by the offices of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and Garda Síochána Inspectorate. This is not the case. The former is a body that deals with complaints made by individual citizens about their treatment by individual gardaí. This does not constitute oversight of Garda policies and procedures or involvement in the drafting of codes or human rights proofing of policies. The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission does not hold the Garda Commissioner to account in any sense or assess his performance in relation to policing plans, strategies and priorities. Similarly, the Garda Síochána Inspectorate cannot provide the type of independent oversight envisaged for the proposed board because it may only act or report on matters when instructed to do so by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1425"> The Minister expressed a concern that a 16 member board would not be able to operate effectively. Either he did not read or he chose to ignore the section which provides that the board would have a full complement of staff to assist it, as is the case in respect of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. Moreover, the composition of the board is broadly in line with a recommendation by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and a motion passed by the Labour Party in 2001 calling for a policing authority to be established with approximately 15 members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426"> Rather than address the substantive points raised in the Bill about the structure of policing, the Minister preferred to devote much of his time to nitpicking about the composition of the board. The experience of people such as the Ombudsman for Children and Data Protection Commissioner would be invaluable to the board. The idea of such individuals serving on more than one board is not as foreign as the Minister suggests. Given the strong emphasis on human rights in the proposed board, the experience of these two officeholders would be particularly apt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427"> The Minister also believes that the appointment of the Chief Inspector of the Garda Síochána Inspectorate to the board would create a conflict of interest. Given the focus in the Bill on co-operative development of policing policy and the partnership approach envisaged between the Garda Commissioner and proposed board, this appointment would be particularly appropriate. Again, I wonder if the Minister has considered the measured arrangements proposed in the Bill in any depth or with any seriousness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1428"> The value of transparency is promoted throughout the Bill by the requirement on the board to publish all relevant codes, operational policies and procedures and the requirement on the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to receive and publish follow-up details of investigations. Publication of and access to these documents has long been recommended by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Irish Human Rights Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1429"> The Bill also provides for greater transparency by identifying the Garda Síochána as a public body for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act. It is disturbing to note that the Minister is prepared to ignore the recommendations of the United Nations with regard to Ireland's non-compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, particularly Article 7. He has also chosen to ignore the 2009 recommendations of the Irish Human Rights Commission which are reflected in many of the proposals in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1430"> Yesterday, the Minister and other speakers on the Government side demonstrated a lack of understanding of the true meaning of the concept of democratic accountability and what is required in this regard. Democratic accountability in its purest form means accountability of the Garda to the people. From the bottom up, the board would take into consideration the recommendations of joint policing committees. The proposals allow for a multi-layered form of democratic accountability rather than the very limited form about which the Minister spoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431"> The Minister indicated the Garda Commissioner is currently answerable to the Dáil via the Minister by virtue of the ability of Deputies to table parliamentary questions. This is nonsense. If a question is tabled which relates to operational matters, the Minister will indicate that it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. The Dáil has very limited power because Parliament is totally controlled by the Executive. So much for the argument that the Garda Commissioner is held to account by elected representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432"> That so many politicians are determined to prove their support for and dedication to the Garda Síochána further limits the Dáil's potential to hold the Garda to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1433">They were falling over themselves in their attempts to be identified as pro-Garda. I am not anti-Garda, but I believe it is in the interest of every citizen, including all the honest gardaí, that there is real accountability in our police force, a police force for the people and not just a tool of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434"> There is a couple in the Visitors Gallery tonight who say they have been subjected to repeated Garda harassment through inappropriate searches, false accusations and seizure of mobile telephones over the past year or so. They also allege an assault by a garda during one of the searches. They have two children, eight and nine years old, who have witnessed some of this intimidation. The children are afraid, find it difficult to sleep and they wet the bed. They do not want to be at home in case the gardaí come again. These people feel that accountability would help.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1564">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1565">That, in accordance with Standing Order 102A(2)(<i>a</i>), Dáil Éireann notes and welcomes the Government's priorities for the Lithuanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.”</p>
          <p eId="para_1566">I wish to begin by saying how pleased I am to be here with the newly appointed Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Paschal Donohoe. I wish him well in his new office and I congratulate him on his appointment. The Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, will be replying in the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1567"> A little over two weeks ago Lithuania took over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the first time. It is the first Baltic state to do so. In itself, this is a symbolic reminder of how the European Union has helped to heal the divisions of our once divided continent and to secure peace and stability in Europe. I welcome this opportunity to reflect on Lithuania's Presidency priorities for the coming months. Ireland is the first member of the current trio of Presidencies that includes Lithuania and Greece.</p>
          <p eId="para_1568">Over the past two years, we have worked very closely with the Lithuanian Administration at both political and official level in preparing for our Presidencies, following on from our close co-operation from 2011 to 2012 when Lithuania and Ireland successively held the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE. It is not surprising, therefore, that there is a strong degree of commonality in the priorities we have adopted and of continuity between the two Presidencies. Above all, we were clear from the outset that the European Union needed to adopt the measures necessary to put the economic and financial crisis behind us and to return to a path of sustainable growth and job creation. I therefore welcome the emphasis placed in the Lithuanian Presidency programme on promoting stability and stimulating employment, particularly youth employment, as well as economic growth and competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1569"> As with all Presidencies, the Lithuanian policy programme is shaped to a great extent by the progress made by the preceding Presidency in managing the European Union's legislative agenda. In particular, with the agreements secured by Ireland on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, with its implications for many key legislative dossiers, Lithuania must manage a large body of implementing legislation required to give effect to the MFF and ensure that funding is available from the start of 2014. The Lithuanian Presidency also comes at a critical juncture, as the European Union's legislative cycle will reach its end during the first semester of 2014, with the elections for the European Parliament scheduled to take place in May 2014. Lithuania will therefore hold the final full six-month Presidency before the European Parliament elections, and there will be a certain pressure to make progress on a range of files by the end of its Presidency. From our close working relationship, I know the Lithuanian Administration is well prepared for the challenges ahead and is adopting a pragmatic approach to running the Presidency. Like Ireland, its ambition is to act as an honest broker in chairing the Council and negotiating with the European Parliament, with a firm focus on results that are of benefit to the Union and its citizens as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1570"> The Lithuanian Presidency programme is divided into three policy clusters under the headings of Credible, Growing and Open Europe. Credible Europe reflects many of the issues the Irish Presidency prioritised under the stability strand of its programme, with an emphasis on a stable financial sector and improved economic governance. Ireland already has secured agreement on two key elements of the banking union package - namely, the single supervisory mechanism and the capital requirements directive - and has made good progress on the banking recovery and resolution proposal. The Lithuanian Presidency will take on this work and will seek to make progress on the remaining elements of the banking union package, the deposit guarantee schemes and the single resolution mechanism. As with recent Presidencies, Vilnius also will work to deepen economic and monetary union and to implement the decisions that were taken at the June European Council. It will continue efforts to enhance economic governance and streamline economic and budgetary co-ordination with the European Union. A further element of the Lithuanian programme concerns combating tax fraud, tax evasion and money laundering.</p>
          <p eId="para_1571"> Under the rubric of Growing Europe, Lithuania stresses the need for a competitive internal market and investment in research, the green economy and labour-intensive projects. Like Ireland, the Lithuanian Presidency aims to make further progress on the Single Market proposals to drive competitiveness, growth and job creation. It will prioritise the digital single market and the research and innovation sector, which are also key areas for Ireland and are essential for long-term growth prospects in Europe. A major event during the Lithuanian Presidency will be the ICT 2013 conference, which will take place in Vilnius in November. I particularly welcome the emphasis placed in the Lithuanian programme on measures to enhance employment, particularly youth unemployment, building on the progress reached on the youth guarantee during our Presidency. It will also encourage the implementation of the social investment package and prioritise better worker protection, including the protection of migrant workers. A particular priority for the Lithuanians - one that is entirely understandable from a national perspective but which is of importance for Europe as a whole - is the question of energy supply and security. The Presidency will work to advance the completion of the internal energy market and to ensure access to EU energy networks for all member states, bringing to an end the energy isolation of a number of member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_1572"> The Open Europe cluster of the Lithuanian Presidency programme deals essentially with external affairs, with a particular priority attached to the European Neighbourhood Policy, enlargement and trade. It is natural that the Lithuanian Presidency should prioritise the European Neighbourhood Policy, and it brings both an important regional perspective and specific historical experience to the matter. In November, Vilnius will host the Eastern Partnership summit, which will mark one of the highlights of the Lithuanian Presidency. Like Ireland, Lithuania is a strong supporter of enlargement, and the accession of Croatia on 1 July was a propitious start to the Presidency. Building on the encouraging developments under the Irish Presidency, Lithuania will seek to advance accession negotiations with Turkey and Montenegro and ensure a European perspective for the other countries of the western Balkans. The Presidency has committed to continue the enlargement process based on firm and clear fulfilment of the membership criteria. An ambitious external trade agenda is also an important priority for the Lithuanian Presidency, as it was for us. It will seek to deepen economic and trade relations with the Eastern Partnership countries in particular, culminating in the Eastern Partnership Vilnius summit at the end of November, at which it is expected that Armenia, Georgia and Moldova will initial next-generation association agreements with the European Union. In addition to taking on a leadership role in protecting human rights and the principles of democracy and ensuring regional stability, Lithuania will work on the post-2015 development agenda. The Lithuanian Presidency will also support the further development and strengthening of the Common Security and Defence Policy in the run-up to discussion on security and defence issues at the December European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1573"> The priorities of the Lithuanian Presidency are set out in detail in a programme that runs to more than 40 pages. I have asked that a copy be laid before the Houses. It is also available on the excellent Lithuanian Presidency website, <i>www.eu2013.lt</i>. I hope, however, that it is clear from what I have outlined that there is a common thread running through the Irish and the Lithuanian Presidencies - that is, the need to put the crisis behind us, to get Europe back on the path of sustainable long-term growth, to invest in the smart jobs of the future and to tackle the unacceptable level of youth unemployment that afflicts Europe today. The Irish Government will do its utmost to support the work of the Lithuanian Presidency and we wish our Lithuanian friends every success in the months ahead. I commend this motion to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1574">Fianna Fáil will be supporting this motion. At the outset, I extend my best wishes to the Lithuanian Government and the Lithuanian people on taking up the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the first time. As the Tánaiste is aware from his experience over the past six months, it is a great honour to lead the Council of the European Union. It is also a great responsibility which gives the Presidency in office an exciting opportunity to make a real and significant impact on the direction of the European Union. With a population of approximately 3 million people, Lithuania, like Ireland, has the potential for an influence on the Union that is far beyond its size.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575"> I also wish to take this opportunity to officially congratulate the new Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, on his appointment. I wish him well in his role and much success. It is an honour to represent Ireland in this role and I believe Deputy Donohoe will do a great job in it. I have had the honour and pleasure of working with the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, on the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs for a number of years and I know him to be a man of the highest personal integrity. He is someone who I believe to have great intellect and wisdom and I am sure he will bring all that to his new role. I also know him to be a man of great humility, a characteristic which I believe will stand to him exceptionally well in the role he now holds. I wish him every success, and I mean that on a personal basis as well as on behalf of my party.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1577">Our two countries have much in common, including our size, our history of struggling towards independence and our peripheral geographical location on the European continent. It was apt that Lithuania joined the European Union under the successful Irish Presidency of the European Union in 2004, when ten new member states from central and eastern Europe joined in the largest expansion of the Union in its history.</p>
          <p eId="para_1578"> The theme of this Presidency, as has already been outlined, is "For a Credible, Growing and Open Europe". This theme is more important now than ever before in the development of the European project. The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs had an opportunity to hear from the Lithuanian ambassador in recent days and he set out what I consider to be a highly credible agenda. It was clear to members of the joint committee that his Government is both committed to that and has thought it through.</p>
          <p eId="para_1579">Clearly, it has been in contact with the Irish Administration and our officials in Brussels who do and have done an outstanding job through various Presidencies. I am aware from my contacts with other ambassadors and politicians throughout Europe that our Permanent Representation lends a hand to others and I have no doubt that it has already been working, as part of the troika, on ensuring Lithuania is given every assistance in its efforts. We all look forward to a successful outcome to that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1580"> Since 2008 the European Union has lacked credibility in a number of key areas. This resulted in the crisis of confidence which engulfed our economic, financial and political systems. After much constitutional wrangling in the last decade, with two comprehensive treaty changes in ten years, the European Union found itself unprepared and unable to deal with the consequences of an unprecedented debt crisis. We have not yet recovered from that crisis of confidence, although the fundamental threat to the cohesion and future development of the Union has, it appears, receded for now. We have talked on many occasions in the House about the unsightly weekly press conferences conducted in front of the Élysée Palace or somewhere in Germany, at which two of the largest member states sought to fill the vacuum because the institutional architecture was found wanting when there was a crisis. I am pleased that, at last, there is an opportunity to work towards ensuring it is never allowed to happen again and that smaller states such as Ireland and Lithuania remain a key feature of the decision-making process. That is why the Commission will have to take such a central role. Unfortunately, when the crisis hit, it was found wanting and we were left with the bilateral approach which did a great deal to undermine confidence in the Union as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1581"> It is welcome that Lithuania will focus its efforts on enhancing the European Union's ability to provide adequate responses to the economic, financial, social and energy challenges. These are comprehensive challenges but certainly not insurmountable. If the European Union had provided for an adequate response to the unprecedented banking and financial crisis in 2008, it is probable that this recession which has now lasted almost five years would have been much shorter. Having established a flawed monetary union in the 1990s, without proper economic stabilisers or a properly mandated central bank, the European political elite failed to remedy these flaws quickly enough when the crisis hit. This resulted in an existential crisis in the Union and has caused much hardship to millions of European citizens who suffer the scourge of unemployment, poverty and inequality today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1582"> Yes, progress has been made in recent months, but it is slow and cumbersome. The delay in implementing a fully functioning banking union, with certain member states squabbling over which banks should and should not be covered, is a clear example that some decision makers in the European Union have simply not learned the lessons of the past. In a time of crisis they looked at the national interest rather than sharing and pooling resources, which was at the heart of the development of the Union. All would have benefited if countries had worked collectively. The failure of the EU institutions to embrace the European Council's commitment to separate sovereign debt and banking debt is a further indictment of the current leadership of the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1583"> There is, without question, still much to do to restore the European Union's credibility among our international partners and, most importantly, citizens. Last week we saw a further lack of vision on the part of the member states of the European Union when they sought a reduction of €720 million in the EU budget for 2014. Bizarrely, these cuts included a proposed cut of €194 million from the Union's cohesion budget, the very budget which could spur growth in Europe's weakest regions. To ensure it is credible, the Union must work and deliver progress for all its citizens; from east to west; core to peripheral and rich to poor. Cutting the EU budget is counterproductive in achieving this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1584"> The European Union must promote more growth within its borders. Growing our economies by remaining competitive and consolidating financial stability is vital for the future health of the European economy. The completion of the Single Market would also create huge potential for growth in Europe, as it has done in the past. The lifting of barriers to the movement of goods, services, capital and people in the Union has produced millions of extra jobs and increased European wealth levels. That is not disputed by anybody who has a clear insight into the way in which the Union has worked as a result of these changes. It has happened to unprecedented levels. Now is the time to complete what is left to do and remove the final barriers to a full Single Market in Europe. This means integrating our markets further but with proper Europe-wide supervision which will flag difficulties well before a problem becomes a full blown crisis. Further EU integration and the strengthening of the Single Market, including energy, will bring new opportunities to combat unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, and make the European economic and social model more solid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1585"> Much talk has emanated from Europe about youth unemployment. We need far more concrete measures to ensure the appropriate labour activation measures are in place in order that young people who are leaving formal education, be it secondary, tertiary or fourth level, find meaningful labour activation until such time as jobs become available. In our small country we have seen the scourge of unemployment lead to some of our brightest and best people travelling to Australia, New Zealand and further afield in the southern hemisphere to take up employment opportunities there. That brain drain across the European Union will have a long-term impact on our ability to compete, particularly given the significant threats we face from the BRIC - Brazil, Russia, India and China - countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1586"> Ireland knows better than most the importance of an integrated energy market. The integration of this market offers us the opportunity to secure energy supply, lower energy costs and export surplus energy to our partners in Europe. Ireland imports over 88% of its energy resources, largely consisting of gas, making our energy market vulnerable to external energy shocks caused by both political and economic change in the wider world. In essence, Ireland's energy market is like a bottle cork floating in a very large and turbulent sea. Fully connecting our energy market within Europe will ground it and notably improve our energy security. It should help to protect us from unpredictable external energy shocks. Crucially, too, it will also guarantee a market for our excess wind energy, making the wind energy sector in Ireland a secure and profitable industry. It will also send a strong signal to the investors we seek to assist in the re-emergence of growth in the economy, particularly foreign direct investment. Energy security is a fundamental consideration for many of the industries seeking to position themselves outside their current locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1587"> It is true that the openness of the European Union to new members, neighbours and trade partners will not only advance the EU economy but will also reaffirm the founding aims of the Union. These aims, to develop a prosperous, peaceful, democratic, free and open Europe, are as important today as at any time in the past. We welcome Lithuania's commitment to these aims and an open European Union. Ireland has always welcomed new partners to the European Union and often acted as a bridge across the Atlantic between Europe and America. The current negotiations between the United States and the European Union to establish a transatlantic trade and investment partnership are to be welcomed and I hope they will be successfully concluded. If the negotiations are successfully completed, this agreement would be the biggest bilateral trade deal ever negotiated and could add approximately 0.5% to the European Union's annual economic output, which would be an impressive achievement, particularly at a time of economic stagnation across the Union. I hope this agreement can be agreed during Lithuania's Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1588"> I hope that in six months we will have seen substantial progress on all of these issues and, in particular, a banking union in Europe, final steps towards a single EU energy market and the successful conclusion of the EU-US trade negotiations. I wish the Lithuanian Presidency every success in taking brave and bold actions to consolidate and advance the Continent's achievements of the past 50 years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1589">I wish to be associated with the remarks about the Minister of State. Like others, I will miss his insights and contributions at the Joint Committee on European Affairs, but we will no doubt meet him regularly in his elevated position. I sincerely congratulate him and his family and wish him well and every success in his new role. I have no doubt that he will be as inclusive as he was at the committee in respect of his politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_1590"> Ireland's EU Presidency has officially ended and Lithuania has begun its Presidency. As other speakers said, it is that country's first time to hold the Presidency. I congratulate all those associated with the Irish Presidency, particularly the staff who worked on it in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and at different committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1591">I thank them for the energy they displayed and the hard work they did during the very professional and engaging Irish Presidency of the EU. Everyone agrees that, as a result of our financial situation, the costs relating to the Presidency had to be kept to a bare minimum. While I would have some issues with certain expenditures, I welcome the fact that the Presidency came in €9 million under budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1592"> I wish Lithuania the best of Irish luck with its first EU Presidency. I hope it will be a success. I also hope it will signal both a new beginning and an end to the difficulties facing millions across the EU. This is a vital time for the Union, which is trying to come to terms with the biggest socioeconomic problems to afflict it since its inception. There is no doubt that it is decision time for Europe. Austerity has not worked and, to a large degree, has actually contributed to exacerbating the problem. The financial crisis is having a negative effect on the majority of people across the EU. Politicians in European capitals appear to have no sense of how it is affecting ordinary citizens. Thousands of Greeks hurt by huge unemployment and crippling social cuts have been forced to queue for food handouts, which is a first for them since the Second World War. Unemployment has soared to record highs in both France and Spain, as the impact of government spending cuts and a collapse in consumer confidence is leading to a corresponding collapse in the employment market. A staggering 56.4% of young Spaniards are currently unemployed. In Portugal the figure in this regard is 18%, while in Cyprus it is 15.6%. Tens of thousands of young Irish people are being forced to emigrate, carers hours are being cut, a family home tax has been introduced, child welfare has been cut, hundreds of thousands of families are just about making ends meet and huge numbers of them are being thrown into fuel poverty or skipping meals in order to keep a roof over their heads. Only this week we read newspaper headlines about people suffering with cancer who are going to experience difficulty in accessing medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1593"> It is obvious that austerity policies currently being pursued are deepening the impoverishment of EU citizens and prolonging the financial crisis. It is almost as if we are caught on a runaway train and no one seems to know how to get off. There is no sense of crisis among political leaders. There is no urgency or any understanding of the affect the crisis is having on families and individuals across Europe. At the end of the Irish Presidency, a political agreement was reached on the EU's seven-year budget. This is the first time in 56 years that the EU budget has been cut. I cannot welcome this decision while the Union is facing into its biggest crisis since its inception and is continuing to expand. The reality is that this is an austerity budget which will lock the EU into austerity for the next seven years. It does not contain sufficient spending to boost investment in jobs and growth and it will leave many member states starved of strategic investment in key areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1594"> Much has been made of the agreement to spend €8 billion during the next two years to support job creation, training and apprenticeships for young people. However, that amount is simply not nearly enough to tackle this major socioeconomic problem. More than half of under-25s in Greece and Spain are out of work, while in Italy the figure stands at 40%. In Ireland the youth unemployment rate is over 30% and would be higher but for the haemorrhaging of youth from towns and cities across the island. This current generation of European youth is probably one of the most educated which Europe has ever produced. However, the EU is confining many of them to unemployment, underemployment or emigration by only allocating €8 billion in the form of the youth guarantee. The International Labour Organisation has estimated that €21 billion would be needed over two years to halt the increase in the EU's youth unemployment rate. Like the EU budget, this youth guarantee is not fit for purpose. It promises much in rhetoric but essentially it will not provide enough funding or investment in order to facilitate the creation of essential jobs and economic growth. This is not new funding that we have been promised, rather it comes from within the new scaled-down EU budget. Eurofound estimates the cost of youth unemployment in Europe at €150 billion a year. The social costs in this regard are also evident each day in constituencies across Ireland and Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1595"> The provision of €8 billion for the youth guarantee shows that neither the EU nor Ireland, during its Presidency, have reacted to the scale of the problem. The question that arises is whether the Lithuanian Presidency will bring more of the same or something different. Will it facilitate further austerity or can it help to lead us in a new direction towards a stimulus of growth and jobs? I agree with the President of a certain EU member state who recently said that the dominant economic thinking in Europe and elsewhere is "the great flaw of our times", that the reaction of EU leader to the crisis is "disparate, sometimes delayed, not equal to the urgency of the task and showing insufficient solidarity" and that "We need a Europe that shows solidarity with the most vulnerable among us - that throws real energy and determination behind efforts to create real sustainable growth." The EU needs to wake up to the problems of its ordinary citizens. It needs to react with stimulus and solidarity. Unfortunately, such a reaction did not occur during Ireland's Presidency. I hope Lithuania will buck the trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1596"> I hope the spotlight that the Presidency brings will improve conditions for those citizens held in Lithuanian prisons. I am concerned with regard to the way Lithuania treats prisoners, particularly those from other member states. I recently raised this matter with the Lithuanian ambassador at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in the context of the condition of a particular Irish prisoner, Mr. Michael Campbell, who is being held at a facility outside Vilnius. Mr. Campbell has experienced many difficulties and has been subjected to closed visits. The High Court here and that in the North both refused to extradite prisoners to Lithuania on foot of the inhuman and degrading treatment meted out in the jail in which Mr. Campbell is being held. If there is anything Lithuania can do during its Presidency, it would be to improve the conditions of those Lithuanians, Irish and others who are imprisoned in its jails. Mr. Campbell's court case is due to be heard shortly and the DPP's Lithuanian counterpart has objected to the sentence originally imposed. I hope there will be a speedy outcome to the case and that he can be repatriated to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1597"> The Tánaiste referred to his hope that the crisis is behind us. I do not believe anyone in Europe, regardless of the position he or she holds, is of the opinion that the crisis is behind us. It is clear that it is very much still in front of us. We must work collectively to arrive at new ways of addressing the crisis. As politicians who were elected to bring about change, we have a responsibility to provide leadership on this issue. The best way we can do that is to try in this Parliament, the European Parliament and elsewhere to find new ways to address the crisis which is having an impact on so many people throughout the EU.</p>

          <p eId="para_1598">In the first instance, I wish to congratulate officially my constituency colleague, Deputy Donohoe, on his elevation. It is rather ironic that as one is elevated in this institution, one moves downward in terms of one's seating position. The new Minister of State looks very comfortable in the seat he now occupies. I know him from my time as a Member of the Dáil and from our constituency. I am aware that he is a man of integrity and honesty, that he is hard working and that he has a very nice sense of humour. The latter is all too lacking in this place at times. One of the aspects of the Minister of State's sense of humour, is an ability to laugh at himself. I offer him my very best wishes in his new role.</p>

          <p eId="para_1600">I take this opportunity to acknowledge what Ireland achieved during its Presidency of the EU. I also acknowledge the hard work, commitment and dedication of everyone from ministerial level down through the various staff levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1601"> I am a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and I chair the Irish section of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA. In that context, I wish to focus on a number of areas. Our priorities for our Presidency were stability, jobs and growth, enlargement, engaging with our global partners and development.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_137">I particularly want to focus on the priorities involving the developing world and the global south. I acknowledge the support of the Irish Government and Irish Aid for the recent AWEPA conference entitled "Hope, Hunger and Land", which President Michael D. Higgins opened in the Royal Hospital. It coincided with the end of our Presidency. It was attended by parliamentarians from Africa, Ireland and the EU and by many representatives from NGOs and the development community. The issues that emerged from that conference and a conference in May on nutrition and climate justice have shown areas where Ireland has been a leader, where it has been very productive and where achievements have been made, but they also highlight ways to move forward that I hope Lithuania will continue. Both conferences highlighted how we live in a world of gross inequalities. Some of the issues raised and the speeches made by the people at those conferences really brought that home. On the area of hunger, they focused on the vulnerabilities of small farmers, fishermen, women and children. We are living in a world where 870 million people go hungry and 6 million children die from malnutrition yearly. I know the Minister of State had an opportunity to visit one of those countries and he has seen this at first hand. I know he was conscious of the contrast between his own children and the children he met on that journey.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_138"> A certain few corporations completely dominate areas such as grain, tea, bananas and confectionary with the result that they control prices. It is sad to know that 10% of deaths in the developing world are due to armed conflict, but 90% of deaths are due to chronic lack of access to food. There is a very serious immorality when the poor in the developing world are paying for the central heating in the developed world.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_139"> Whenever I have the opportunity at the foreign affairs committee and in parliamentary questions to the Minister I have supported calls for tax justice. I hope this is an area that Lithuania will continue to support. I call for scrutiny of double taxation agreements, the country by county auditing, automatic sharing of tax information between countries and an end to the tax haven secrecy curtailing profit shifting and tax dodging by multinationals especially in poor countries. Various reports and statistics show that developing countries lose $160 billion every year due to unscrupulous multinational companies dodging tax. I know there are other reasons for this such as unscrupulous practices in accountancy and also where there is weak government, weak institutions and corruption. They also play a part in that. I note the calls from NGOs like Trócaire, the Debt and Development Coalition, Christian Aid and Action Aid on this to ensure that the citizens in the developing countries can hold their governments and businesses to account on these matters in order that natural resources in those countries benefit the whole country. </summary>
        <summary eId="sum_140"> Considerable progress has been made and Ireland played a significant role in securing the signing into law of the extractive and forestry industries new payment disclosure requirements. Ireland also oversaw agreement on full country by country reporting for the banking sector. I hope it will be a first priority of the Lithuanian Presidency, with Irish support, to take on the other sectors and include sectors such as transportation or exports, as tax avoidance and corruption were not only confined to the extractive industries.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_141"> I want to make a few points on bio-fuels. Ireland is taking one particular line which I believe has to be adopted but I am not sure if Lithuania will make this a priority. In 2009, the renewable energy directive set a binding target on all member states to achieve at least 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020. The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, in a reply to a question said that the primary means for most, if not all, member states of meeting this target will be by increased use of bio-fuels. He also said in a reply to a question I submitted that he shares the concerns that bio-fuel production, unless properly regulated, can have a negative impact on food production and on food prices. In October 2012, the European Commission, following a number of studies, published a proposal to amend the directive and the Commission included a proposal that the 10% quota would be reduced to 5%. I have discussed this with the Minister and he is also supportive of this because bio-fuels mean higher food prices. There is the irony that a renewable energy directive which has the grand ideal of working to combat climate change can have a negative effect. We know that the bio-fuel industry is driving land grabbing in Africa. One of the NGOs told us that 40 million hectares of African land have been taken for bio-fuels since 2000, leading to land displacement and evictions, which in turn cause hunger and water shortages. The Minister of State, Deputy Costello, has said that countries, particularly in eastern Europe, would see any change to the 10% quota as interfering with their industrial status. We devote 20% of overseas development aid to tackling hunger so we cannot give aid to alleviate hunger with one hand and take it back with the other on the energy issue. I hope that Lithuania will put this on its agenda as one of the priorities of its Presidency. </summary>
        <summary eId="sum_142"> Deputy Crowe, myself and others at a meeting of the foreign affairs committee earlier today brought up the fact that there has been so much failure when it comes to Syria. How many more people have to die? How many more people have to go into the refugee camps where the conditions are appalling? A delegation from our committee, of which I was not a part, visited one of the camps in Jordan. We have heard reports of appalling abuses within the camps. We have learned of a smuggling network, of brothels being set up and of the lack of education for children. These are people who are leaving Syria daily. We know the numbers - almost 100,000 people have been killed already. We know that chemical weapons and scud missiles are being used. We know that people want a political solution but it is not happening. One wonders who is speaking to Mr. Assad about this. If there is going to be a military solution, what will happen to the populations who have been fighting him to date? Given the number of people who are calling for a political solution in Syria, the fighting cannot be allowed to continue. Mr. Guterres described Syria today as another Rwanda. Somebody else described it as having five Srebenicas there. It has been just allowed to continue.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_143"> It is very reminiscent of what happened the Palestinian people. We know the mistakes that were made there and the way in which they were completely displaced from their land. They were put into refugee camps, and some of these camps were subject to appalling brutality. There is another serious humanitarian, political and moral issue in Syria. </summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144"> The Minister was very positive about transformation coming in Burma but serious human rights issues arise for the Rohingya people, and that issue is not being addressed. I hope that Lithuania might take on board some of the issues on which Ireland has been working, although without much success in some areas but it has highlighted them.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_145"> I want to make two further points. First, in the action plan on human rights that Ireland worked on, adopted by the EU Council in June 2012, there was a guideline on the promotion and protection of human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender intersex people. It was adopted at the final Foreign Affairs Council of the Irish Presidency but serious issues arise in Lithuania for people who are gay, bisexual or transgender because 61% of that community suffer from discrimination and harassment. It has the highest rate of hostility towards lesbian and gay people among the 27 EU member states. They are discriminated against when looking for work, in education, in health care and in social security. They face attacks and threats of violence. Lithuania must fulfil the principle of non-discrimination, including on grounds of sexual orientation, as in the EU Convention on Human Rights.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_146"> Second, the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, are aware that a group of Members, both cross-party and Independents, are working on prisoner rights issues in the North of Ireland. As Deputy Crowe said, one of those people is Michael Campbell. Regardless of the crime for which he is in jail. it is about his human rights issues, and it is happening in Lithuania. The appeal was caused by the director of public prosecutions in Lithuania who wanted to try to increase the sentence. That is fair enough if this man is deserving of that sentence, but it must be done in a humane way and the situation in Lithuania for prisoners is far from humane. That has been highlighted by the Council of Europe's committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. I will not detail what we have been told about the conditions in both prisons but it is a challenge to the Lithuanian authorities taking up the Presidency to address this issue.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_147"> It is a momentous occasion for Lithuania. We wish it well. It has had a very tragic, sad history which it has come out of and one would hope its experiences would make it sympathetic and empathetic when it comes to human rights.</summary>
        <speech by="#DominicHannigan" eId="spk_507">
          <from>Deputy Dominic Hannigan<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1602">Before I begin I, too, would like to extend my congratulations to the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe. I have known the Minister of State since we were both elected to the Seanad in 2007. He was a member of the European Union affairs committee from that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1603">Indeed, he chaired the sub-committee that examined the fall-out from the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty. That sub-committee was instrumental in getting the subsequent second referendum passed. I wish the Minister of State well in his new job. I am sure it might seem daunting at times. I would like to remind him of a motto with which he will be familiar. I hope Deputies do not mind me lapsing into Latin. I refer to the phrase <i>audere est facere</i>, which means "to dare is to do". I am sure he will do very well in his new role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1604"> I would like to say a few words about the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Creighton. She was always on top of her game when she appeared before the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs. She did some outstanding work during the Presidency. She visited 44 countries on behalf of the Irish Presidency and clocked up over 120,000 miles. I think I speak for all the members of the joint committee when I say we always found her to be very open and amenable to meeting us to answer our questions. We thank her for her work and we wish her well in the future. It would be remiss of me to neglect to mention that the Clerk of the Dáil is present in the Chamber tonight. Given that he is in his final days in that position, it is a great honour to have him here before us. We would like to wish him well in his future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1605"> All of us know how much hard work went into Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union. We know it took many months of planning to make it happen. I am sure many people in the various Departments are still recovering from our recent Presidency. Lithuania has now been in that role for three weeks. We have already had a great deal of engagement with the Lithuanian authorities. I was in Vilnius last week for a meeting of the chairpersons of European affairs committees from across the Union. The meeting, which was organised by COSAC, was held in the Lithuanian Parliament, the Seimas. It was expertly chaired by Gediminas Kirkilas, who is a former Prime Minister of Lithuania. The success of the Irish Presidency was remarked on time and time again at that meeting. Every single person who mentioned the Presidency to me during my three days in Vilnius spoke about how well we organised it and referred to the great achievements and steps forward we took over the last six months. Advancements were made with the banking union, the European semester and the economic and monetary union. The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach came in for particular praise in Vilnius because we managed to get the multiannual financial framework budget across the line. There will be a vote on this in October. People were very thankful that we managed to hand over the Presidency with that particular portfolio file closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1606"> We discussed the future of the economic and political union at last week's meeting of chairpersons. The Vice President of the Commission, Maroš Šefovi, spoke about how the Commission intends to extend the economic and political union so that it also includes a social dimension. Everyone in this House will welcome that because we all remember how many times it was raised by our citizens during last year's debate on the fiscal compact. Under this social dimension, types of social indicators such as employability, long-term unemployment and poverty will be examined to see how countries are doing. Countries will be measured against these baseline indicators. It is hoped that help will be provided, in one form or another, to countries that fail to reach those benchmarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1607"> Like Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, I have some concerns about LGBT rights in Lithuania. The Lithuanian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who addressed the chairpersons while I was in Vilnius, accepts that there is still some homophobia in certain elements of society and recognises that it has to be tackled. I met the Irish ambassador in Vilnius and the Lithuanian Gay League to talk about the forthcoming Baltic Pride march. Our ambassador there is doing some great work to try to make sure that parade takes place. The Lithuanian ambassador to Ireland, Vidmantas Purlys, addressed last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs. He discussed the specific priorities of the Lithuanian Presidency. He made the point that a huge amount of time and effort has gone into the planning of what is Lithuania's first Presidency. He said that Irish and Lithuanian civil servants have been engaged in ongoing work since 2010 to jointly plan the handover. We have extended to Lithuania the knowledge we have acquired during our seven Presidencies. This shows again the high regard in which Irish civil servants are held across the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1608"> The work that Lithuania will do during its Presidency will focus on a credible, growing and open Europe, much as we did during our Presidency. Economic growth, job creation and financial stability are the priorities of the Lithuanian Presidency. Of course Lithuania has a specific interest in the eastern partnership, involving countries like Belarus and Ukraine. The ambassador, Mr. Purlys, spoke with great energy about the possibilities that the next six months hold for his country, for the Presidency and or Europe. When I spoke to him again last night, I said I hoped he would appear before our joint committee again before Lithuania's Presidency comes to an end. That will probably happen in October, in advance of the visit to Lithuania of a delegation from the committee. The members in question will attend the 50th plenary session of COSAC, which will take place in Vilnius over two days. The Lithuanian authorities have put together an interesting agenda for that conference. I will address a session of the conference on the evolving and important role of national parliaments in the European semester. I do not doubt that this will add to the debate that is under way in that regard. Having heard about the Lithuanian priorities from the ambassador and at least week's meeting in Vilnius, I have no doubt that the Lithuanian authorities will deliver on their plans for a very progressive and ambitious Presidency. I look forward to it. I wish them well.</p>

          <p eId="para_1610">I have one or two questions. Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan spoke about bio-fuels. I attended a conference at which the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, spoke about how Ireland was pursuing the possibility of reducing the bio-fuels limit to 5%. It is extraordinary that companies are buying good land in Africa and poorer countries around the world - they are essentially land-grabbing - and using this land to plant bio-fuels rather than to grow food. At the same time, Europe has a policy of setting aside viable land because it does not want to produce too much food. Perhaps that land could be used for bio-fuel production. There needs to be a register of European companies that are involved in land-grabbing so that people can know what Irish, German or French companies are up to. That would give them an opportunity to lobby their Governments and use their spending power to show these companies that their actions are seen as unacceptable. Does the Minister of State have a view on the matter? The relevance of Europe's set-aside policy to this issue struck me in recent days. It came up earlier when I attended a meeting with the Minister. There seems to be an obvious relationship between the two issues. I know that many farmers are totally opposed to, or do not like, the idea of agricultural land going fallow.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T22:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1611">I thank Deputy Crowe for his question and his kind comments on my appointment and the role I played at the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I also acknowledge Deputy Hannigan's comments about the work I did during my tenure on the committee and thank him for them. I assure both of them and the other speakers that I view my engagement with the joint committee and with this Chamber as being central to the work I will do in my new role as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs. I might get an opportunity at that forum to respond to the point made by Deputy Hannigan about the role of national parliaments in the semester. I believe this is going to be a central issue for this Parliament and for parliaments all over the eurozone and the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1612"> In respect of Deputy Crowe's specific question about the role of bio-fuels and the developing world, my view on that and related issues was strongly influenced by a visit last year to Malawi with Trócaire. I saw at first hand the impact of some of the broad issues raised by Deputy Crowe and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan. It is one thing to read about these things in the confines of the developed world from the comfort of our living rooms, but when one goes to countries grappling with challenges vaster than perhaps we can imagine despite our huge difficulties and sees their heroism and the efforts they are making, it really brings home all we need to do to support them in their work. When I received the great news regarding my appointment as Minister of State, amid contacting all those who contacted me, I contacted Trócaire and GOAL to tell them that while I acknowledged that my constituency colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development, Deputy Costello, was doing an excellent job on development issues and our role abroad, if I could offer any assistance whatsoever, I certainly will. Having seen the difficulties many of these countries face, I would be very eager to give whatever small amount of help my office can to help that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1613"> In respect of the Deputy's broader point about bio-fuels, I know this issue was discussed at the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade earlier today. If there is an opportunity for me to raise it within the General Affairs Council or at any point in supporting the Tánaiste through his work on the Foreign Affairs Council, I will do so. In the interim, I will take time, through Minister of State, Deputy Costello, and his office, to acquaint myself with the issues about which the Deputy spoke. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. I am aware that he has raised other points in his contribution earlier on and if he wants to ask any questions relating to them, I will certainly do my best to answer them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1614">I reiterate what other colleagues have said. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, on his appointment and wish him all the best. I know he has the capacity to deal with the onerous task ahead of him. I also wish Deputy Creighton all the best in the future. She did an excellent job during our Presidency and I wish her all the best for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1615"> I have a question relating to the Lithuanian Presidency. Does the Minister of State envisage that the Lithuanian Presidency will push for a pan-European effort to get multinationals in sub-Saharan countries to pay their fair share of tax in order that those countries can at least get some sort of footing regarding being able to help themselves?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_512" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe<recordedTime time="2013-07-17T22:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1616">I thank the Deputy for his question and thank him for his very kind comments. This issue was raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan in her contribution. It goes back to the issue of tax justice on which many people have been campaigning for many years. I should say that I worked for a multinational company before I got into political life. I think we must be balanced and accurate in how we talk about their role within our economy and the economies of other countries, as Deputy Lawlor has been. In respect of the role of multinationals within the developing world, what we have already said through our involvement in many organisations like the OECD and the work we are doing across the European Union is that we support all efforts that are made in respect of increasing tax transparency and making sure the activities in which any multinational company is involved or the decisions it makes are not to the detriment of the natural jurisdictions within which it operates or the ability of these countries to govern themselves in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1617"> I am very much aware that the potential lost resource that could be coming out of these economies is in many cases greater than the development aid and support that is going into them. Ireland has made very clear that we have a long-standing commitment to development aid and a clear appreciation of the role of tax transparency and ensuring people pay the right tax in the right place to the right people. I will certainly ensure the points made by the Deputy are passed on to the right people within my Department and again assure him that in my participation in the Foreign Affairs Council, I will certainly raise those points. I will conclude by saying that they are very much infused by the short amount of time I spent in a country grappling with many of those challenges, as I know Deputy Lawlor has done as well. I know the value in supporting those countries on their way towards getting the right tax revenue and right kind of governance for themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_1618">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, on his new appointment. As a member of the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs myself, I know he was a very capable member of that committee and I was always confident that he was destined for greater things, and certainly that came true. I look forward to questioning him in the committee in the near future. I also commend the former Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, on her role as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs over the past two years. She certainly excelled herself during the Irish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1619"> I noted from the Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs that the Lithuanian Presidency has plans for a summit in Vilnius regarding EU-Russian relations. Obviously, it is a close neighbour of Russia. In respect of energy supply and given the importance of Russian oil and gas supply to the EU, could the Minister of State comment on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_1620">I thank Deputy Kyne for his question. I was going to refer in my concluding contribution to the huge contribution of my predecessor but I want to take the opportunity to refer to Deputy Kyne's question. Deputy Creighton did an extraordinary job in this role. Her service to our country and the European project was demonstrated by her intellect, energy and long-standing interest in European issues. While I know she wishes she was continuing in her office, I know she made a decision because of what she believed was the right thing to do, which we respect and admire. I very much look forward to working with her in my current role to ensure her expertise is still available to the country, as I am sure she would wish. I join Deputy Kyne in wishing her the very best of luck in the future, and I look forward to working with her.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621"> In respect of the specific question asked by Deputy Kyne, for obvious geographical and historical reasons, Lithuania is deeply aware of all of the opportunities and challenges that Russia presents. The Deputy already touched on one of the implicit challenges, namely, the security of energy supply across the European Union and for ourselves. That is why the European Union has put so much effort into looking to do all it can to develop an integrated energy market across Europe and, despite the difficult financial circumstances we are in, still prioritise capital spending to put in place the infrastructure to make us more secure in the future and to make our energy supply more sustainable. I know Lithuania, along with many of its neighbours, is using all opportunities to develop its relationship with Russia. I know it will be using the Presidency to do the same and I can assure the Deputy that through my work on the council, I will support its efforts to develop a successful relationship with Russia.</p>

          <p eId="para_1622">I have raised the issue of Michael Campbell, as has Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, with regard to the prison conditions he is enduring in Lithuania. Does the Minister of State share my concerns not only about the jail conditions in which he is being held but also his safety and the impact of closed visits on his family, about which concerns have also been raised. The courts refuse to extradite people from this jurisdiction and the North to Lithuania because of what European human rights groups have described as inhumane and degrading treatment in its jails. It is a worrying development and I ask the Minister of State whether he has any comment on it. A delegation of parliamentarians from the House will visit the jail in which Mr. Campbell is being held and everyone hopes he will be removed from the conditions in which is being held and repatriated as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1623">I thank the Deputy for this question. I am aware of his interest in the matter because I attended the committee meeting held last week at which he raised it with the Lithuanian ambassador. I have requested an update on the issue. In my work as a constituency representative I have visited a prison because I entirely agree with the point made by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that regardless of the crime committed, everybody is entitled to the right kind of facilities in detention while serving a sentence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1624"> I will give the Deputy an update on the work which has taken place on this matter. Our embassy has informed us that it has been in regular contact with the appropriate Lithuanian authorities. The Irish citizen to whom the Deputy referred has received more than 20 prison visits since his initial detention in 2008. Most recently he was visited on 3 June. I will give some information, but I will be happy to give the Deputy more information later if it is of interest to him. In 2008 the Irish citizen in question was visited in January, February, March, April, May, October and December. In 2009 he was also visited frequently and in 2010 received four visits. In 2011 he was visited twice and was also visited twice in 2012. As I have mentioned, he was also visited a number of weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1625"> I have been informed that the transfer of prisoners between Lithuania and Ireland takes place under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons which lays out the conditions and processes by which a request from a prisoner in one jurisdiction for a transfer is evaluated and judged by the jurisdiction in which the prisoner is based and how the transfer happens. As the Deputy will no doubt realise and accept, we must all recognise the ability of jurisdictions to make a decision on these matters on their own. At times Sinn Féin has correctly and wisely pointed to the dangers of national sovereignty being encroached upon by other organisations and we must respect how the Lithuanian authorities will make their decision on this matter. Our officers in our embassy in Lithuania will offer all assistance they can to the concerned citizen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1626"> I was not aware - I thank the Deputy for telling me - that a delegation of parliamentarians would visit, as is their right, and I hope their visit will assuage some of the concerns raised by the Deputy. I will continue to monitor and pursue the matter in any way I can. The Lithuanian ambassador offered us his assurances regarding what was happening in the prison, which we accept, but one of our citizens is serving a sentence there and I would be grateful if the Deputies informed me of the results of their visit. We will continue to monitor the position and give any help we can, while clearly recognising the rights of the Lithuanian Government and its authorities to handle the matter in line with its own laws and how it believes it should be dealt with.</p>

          <p eId="para_1627">Before I ask the Minister of State to make his concluding remarks, I congratulate him on his elevation to the office he now holds. In the short time I have known him I have found him to be a fine public representative, a hard worker and a man of integrity. I wish him many years of good luck in his role, although I suppose not too many, as we hope to be back some day ourselves. For the period he is in office I wish many years of health and happiness in his role.</p>

          <p eId="para_1630">I thank the Acting Chairman for his kind words and colleagues for their contributions and questions. I genuinely assure all of them of my deep respect for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs which is ably chaired by Deputy Dominic Hannigan. I look forward to working with all members of the committee in my time in office. I also thank my party colleagues, Deputies Anthony Lawlor and Seán Kyne, for their questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1631"> I urge the House to accept the motion. For me, the context is the day in May 2004 which many Irish people remember when the wonderful ceremony was held in the Phoenix Park to recognise the accession of Lithuania and nine other member states to the European Union. We now find ourselves at the wonderful point where, just less than ten years later and less than 25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Lithuania, a small country like Ireland and which is also facing many challenges, is moving into its first Presidency of the European Union. This clearly demonstrates the strength of the project of the European Union and the enlargement process. I wish to put this in context in terms of what has happened in Europe during the very deep crisis we are looking to chart our way through. It is worth making the point that despite the deep sense of crisis in the European Union, now 28 member states strong, we still find five countries looking to get in and three other potential candidates looking to commence negotiations. Despite the huge pressure and sense of crisis we all share, many are looking at the values for which the project stands and its institutions and want to join and participate. Deputy Seán Crowe made comments on the eurozone and I look forward to debating them with him. It is worth emphasising that nine other countries are looking to join the 17 members of the eurozone, despite the crisis the eurozone has gone through. Most recently, this has been exemplified, as many Members have mentioned, by the accession of Croatia to the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1632"> I look at the priorities Lithuania is bringing to its Presidency, its programme which, in many ways, is similar to ours and what it is looking to do. One reason I particularly welcome it is Lithuania understands, in the same way as Ireland does, that the way in which the economic and political sovereignty of many countries can best flourish is through integration with their neighbours on the Continent. Amid the huge difficulties and opportunities which small states, in particular, face, the surest way of navigating is through participation in a project such as that of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1633"> The late Tony Judt, a very famous European historian, wrote a book which inspired in me an interest in European history and politics. The conclusion of this book is that there can be no going back to the world of the autonomous free-standing nation state sharing nothing with its neighbour but a common border.</p>
          <p eId="para_1634">However, he also concluded that men live not in markets but in communities. These are issues of which all of us as public representatives are aware - the sense of disempowerment many people feel as they look at forces that are nearly greater than their control. I will argue in office, as I have argued previously, that the best way of navigating such challenges is through a project such as the European Union. However, let us be clear; much needs to be done to get the European Union back on track. While a degree of financial stability has been achieved, that is not the same as economic growth or creating the kind of living conditions and employment levels we all want for the people we serve, just as leaders all over Europe want for the people they serve. That is why Lithuania, like Ireland, has prioritised action on the Single Market, the digital agenda, investment in research and innovation and the external trade agenda, all with the aim of improving competitiveness and meeting the needs of the citizens we all serve and whom we represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1635"> I wish the Lithuanian Presidency every success in its work in the coming months. I look forward to travelling to Vilnius at the end of August to meet many of my counterparts at the informal meeting of the General Affairs Council. I also take the opportunity to thank all the officials for the wonderful work they have done for our Presidency and for bringing it to such a successful end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1636"> Deputy Hannigan has already touched on the fact that the new Presidency will prioritise how to maintain close engagement with the European Parliament if a country is to secure its own strategic interests within Europe. That is high on the Lithuanian agenda. It is also high on my agenda. I completely agree with Deputy Hannigan’s point that we face a huge challenge in terms of how we reconcile the requirements of economic governance with the prerogatives of political legitimacy. It is a huge tension. I welcome the new frankness in identifying this across Europe. Much needs to be done in this regard. I look forward to discussing and debating the issue in the House and in the Joint Committee on European Affairs chaired by Deputy Hannigan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1637"> The kind of narrative that sustained Europe for a period was about how to rebuild a continent in the context of many countries that had been ravaged. That was then replaced by the concept of how to build and secure Europe in the context of the Cold War. All of that is gone now, and we need a new concept and a new message. Much work has been done in that regard. To date, it has not had the success many of us want, given the fact that the eurozone is now in its sixth successive quarter of contraction and the many difficulties people face. I am clear that the kind of Presidency we recently delivered will be pivotal in rising to the new challenge. I am also sure that the work our Lithuanian friends and colleagues do will be pivotal to that. In that spirit, I commend the motion to the House and thank all my colleagues for their contributions. I look forward to maintaining this work and continuing it in the future.</p>
