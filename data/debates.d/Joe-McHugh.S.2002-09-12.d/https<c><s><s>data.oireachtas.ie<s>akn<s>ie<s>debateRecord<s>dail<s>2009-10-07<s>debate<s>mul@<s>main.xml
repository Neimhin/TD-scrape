        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Yesterday we saw the rather unedifying spectacle of this House being focused entirely on the job of one person, when the work of this House should have been focused on the lives and the careers of the approximately 500,000 people who are unemployed and the approximately 700 job losses announced in Aer Lingus following 250 in Intel.  Other people are being let go because of a lack of credit being made available to them by banks, and their inability to get credit and have extended facilities made available to them.  That is what the House should focus on.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">There is no coherence on where the Government is heading in terms of job protection and job creation in so far as public finances are concerned.  What is the Government's plan for the public finances and the fiscal strategy therein?  In April of this year the Minister for Finance set out his additional measures to be delivered in 2010 and 2011.  A total of €2.25 billion was to be delivered in cuts this year from current expenditure and capital expenditure according to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  Since then, on more than one occasion the Minister has said that the strategy of the Government is to have €4 billion in cuts in spending.  That seems to be a clear departure from the April supplementary Budget Statement issued by the Minister on behalf of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">What is the strategy?  Have the Greens — who will meet this weekend — the former leader of the Progressive Democrats and the Government signed up to a new fiscal strategy in so far as public finances are concerned?  Is it to be €2.25 billion in total spending cuts with a further €2.5 billion from taxation or is it €4 billion in spending cuts for this year?  Which is it?  Has everybody signed up to a new strategy that has been adopted by the Government?  Will the Taoiseach respond on the Government's plan in terms of public finances from here on?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_4">The mid-term fiscal consolidation plan has been approved by the EU Commission for some time.  During the course of this year the Minister introduced a supplementary budget in April.  He has indicated since then that he believes the bulk of the savings that will have to be achieved for 2010 should come on the expenditure side rather than on the taxation side.  He made that position clear.  That approach is generally recognised as being in the right direction.  In preparation for the budget we are maintaining the mid-term fiscal consolidation proposals on the basis that a serious deferral of it over a longer period would increase the debt service repayments and the amount of existing resources going towards debt service interest, which is not in the interests of the country in the long term.  The question of stabilising the public finances and working along the procedures and plans as outlined by the Minister for Finance remains the position of the Government, forms the central framework under which the Government is operating and that will continue to be the case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_5">The point is that the Minister for Finance said in his Budget Statement in April that we are to have total spending cuts of €2.25 billion.  Since then he has repeatedly said it is now €4 billion in spending cuts.  I would like to know which policy it is.  He mentioned €2.5 billion in taxation and €2.25 billion in spending cuts in his April statement but since then he has said there will be cuts of €4 billion.  Can I have a straight answer?  Will there be €4 billion in total spending cuts without any taxation increases or will it be €2.25 billion?</p>
          <p eId="para_6">During the Taoiseach's absence in America last week I asked the Tánaiste about the NAMA situation currently under discussion in the House but she did not have the full information available.  It seems as if there is a growing body of opinion that the NAMA proposal as put forward by the Government will not work.  In the light of comments made even yesterday by a Nobel laureate in economics that it would be criminal to pay over the odds for assets as per the Government's proposal, has the Government received a guarantee from Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland that they will lend the money they will get under the NAMA proposal to business and small enterprise?  Has any indication been given as to when that might happen or how much money will be available for lending to small and medium enterprises under the NAMA proposal?  In the middle of the avalanche of calls yesterday I was contacted by nine small businesses that are strangled for money and cannot get it from the banks despite all of the talk.  Will the Taoiseach answer those three questions in respect of NAMA; when he expects the banks can start lending, whether he has a guarantee that they will lend the money they receive, and what order of finance is envisaged?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_7">With regard to the first matter, I have outlined to Deputy Kenny that the total level of adjustment envisaged by the Minister for Finance in respect of next year, based on his public comments, is €4 billion.  In his Budget Statement he gave indicative figures relating to expenditure and taxation as to how that adjustment will be made.  He has indicated on many occasions since then that he believes the bulk of the €4 billion saving should be more on the expenditure side than on the taxation side.  He will meet with Commissioner Almunia on Friday to update him on recent developments and obviously will work with him on the best way of achieving stability in the public finances.  I note from some comments he has made that it is Deputy Kenny's view, although it is hard to maintain a coherent approach with what he has to say on these matters,——</p>

What the NAMA legislation achieves is to identify the level of distressed assets.  Without identifying that level of distressed assets, the ability to obtain credit from the financial system is not what it would otherwise be in the Irish banking system.  To use that figure for the level of distressed assets as a means of leveraging further credit into the Irish banking system from the European Central Bank is the best means by which we can do that.  There is plenty of support for that position, including among many in the IMF.  The EU has guidelines relating to these matters.  All of them are supportive of what the Government intends to do in this area.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_36">I welcome the statement by the Ceann Comhairle last night that he intends to resign his office at 2.30 p.m. next Tuesday.  I understand he has asked for some time to deal with staff, papers and other issues.  It is not unreasonable that he be given that time.  The Labour Party has a motion of no confidence in the Ceann Comhairle on the Order Paper.  I intend to leave it on the Order Paper and if there is any attempt to take advantage of any changing political circumstances, I will insist that the motion be taken before any other business.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Has the Taoiseach given any consideration to how the House might deal with the election of a new Ceann Comhairle?  This is a new set of circumstances; I do not believe there has been a case previously where it was necessary to elect a Ceann Comhairle in the mid-term of a Dáil.  Given the necessity to have a Ceann Comhairle who will enjoy the confidence of all sides of the House, would the Taoiseach agree to have a meeting of the leaders of the political parties to discuss the election of a new Ceann Comhairle?</p>
          <p eId="para_38">In the context of the necessity to reach agreement on the election of a new Ceann Comhairle, would the Taoiseach also consider the desirability of having agreement on the appointment of a new EU Commissioner?  I raised this issue yesterday on the Order of Business.  I understand contacts are under way between the Commission and the Government with regard to the nomination of a new EU Commissioner and that it is intended to progress this during the month of October.  Will the Taoiseach agree that it would be desirable to consult about the appointment of a new EU Commissioner?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_34">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_39">With regard to the announcement by the Ceann Comhairle of his decision to resign, I respect that decision.  I respect the fact that it is being done in the interests of this House and the Office of Ceann Comhairle.  In light of that decision it is less than seemly to haggle over the arrangements for his early resignation.  It is not unreasonable that the Ceann Comhairle should have the opportunity to organise his affairs, including the implications for staff, and to prepare his statement.  To impute other motives to his decision to resign next week is, as Deputy Rabbitte observed on the radio earlier this morning, merely cynical.  The business of the House should be ordered for next week to provide for the statement to be made by the Ceann Comhairle and the election of a new Ceann Comhairle following his resignation.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Following my parliamentary party meeting discussions involving the Whips and the Ceann Comhairle took place.  As would be my practice, I kept the leader of the Green Party advised of developments in those discussions over the course of yesterday evening.  The situation was clarified by the Ceann Comhairle's decision to announce his intention to resign next week.  That was the course of action he took based on contacts with the Whips and I believe it was the right thing to do.  We should allow that to proceed so the dignity of this House and the dignity of the position can be respected and the incumbent is respected in respect of the decision he has reached.  It is only fair and right.  Perhaps that might be a better way of proceeding given some of the rather unedifying things we have been seeing and hearing in recent times.  That is my strong view on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">I believe that answers the first part of the Deputy's question.  On the other matter, I hope everybody understands and accepts that the prerogatives of Government apply to this Government as they did with previous Administrations.  The filling of that position will receive careful consideration.  I told Deputies yesterday that if they have suggestions to make on a private basis, I will consider them.  However, the prerogatives of the Government in this matter should be respected in this instance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_44">I will come to that.  I believe there should be agreement in the House on the election of a new Ceann Comhairle.  That is why I suggested that there should be a meeting or a discussion among the party leaders about it.  I put that suggestion to the Taoiseach again.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">In respect of the appointment of the EU Commissioner, I do not accept that this should be an office that is in the gift of the Government.  We have had two referenda on the Lisbon treaty and we agreed it was necessary to ratify the treaty in the country's interest.  The right to have a Commissioner appointed was secured before the second referendum took place.  The holder of the Commissioner post should be seen as a representative of the country rather than the parties in government.  There should, therefore, be agreement across the House on who should be appointed and there should certainly be consultation on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">The Taoiseach should not proceed with the appointment of a new Commissioner on the basis that it is in the Government's gift and the Commissioner is a Government appointee.  Last Friday's decision was made by the people and the Government should respond to that.  A great deal of political generosity was shown by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in respect of support for the treaty and by the people who went to the polls last Friday and voted to ratify the treaty and continue our position in and strong link with the European Union, notwithstanding their dislike of the Government.  Now that the referendum is over, it is wrong of the Taoiseach to state that the appointment of Commissioner is the prerogative of the Government.  There should be consultation on the appointment of the Commissioner and the appropriate person should be appointed.  I put it to the Taoiseach again that he should agree to have such consultation.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">To return to the point Deputy Gilmore has again made, I did not suggest that the Commissioner would be appointed as a representative of the Government.  The Commissioner will be a representative of the country.  With respect, the suggestion that if the person to emerge were a member of my party or the Government or a supporter of the Government, it would in some way disqualify him or her or make him or her less qualified than some other way of doing it is not fair or just or a proper way to approach the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">Deputy Gilmore first suggested that we make an appointment by agreement.  His second proposal is that it should be done on the basis of consultation.  I have indicated to him that I am open to hear any views he has on the matter.  That is a question of consultation.  The question of agreement would suggest that the prerogative of Government in some way required the Deputy's agreement and consent.  This was not afforded when the Labour Party was in government or by any other Government.</p>

I indicated to the Deputy yesterday and again today, in a spirit of generosity, that if there were prospective candidates who should receive the consideration of the Government in respect of the issue, I am open to hear from the Deputy on the matter.  That is a fair and honest assessment of the situation and one that is consistent with what I stated yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I would prefer if what I have to say were not regarded as less than generous compared with what Deputy Gilmore has to say.  That is a fair and honest appraisal of the position in respect of the Government's responsibilities in this matter.  They are no different from Governments' responsibilities on previous occasions.

          <p eId="para_56">I have given a fair indication to the Deputy that if he has an interest in this matter and if he forwards names of prospective candidates for consideration by the Government, I will certainly consider them.  However, to suggest that I require his agreement in respect of a nominee is outside the prerogative of the Opposition.  I am anxious to accommodate in whatever way I can, consistent with a consultation process, although not a process of ultimate agreement with the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">On the Deputy's question on the position of Ceann Comhairle, he will have noted from past elections to the position that various parties put forward candidates and we ended up having a vote.  I would regard it as preferable to obtain a unanimous decision on this matter at this time.  Again, I am prepared to listen to what Opposition leaders have to say about the matter.  Informal consultation can take place in the next day or two to see what prospective candidates emerge.  This needs to be done in a way that upholds the dignity of the House.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_60">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">The code of conduct for officeholders, published by the Standards in Public Office Commission, sets out among other things a framework for acceptance of hospitality.  Briefly, the code provides that officeholders should not accept offers of hospitality where to do so would, or might appear to, place them under an obligation.  The code also provides that officeholders should not accept offers to meet the costs of travel facilities and-or commercial accommodation in connection with official activities where such offers are made by private citizens or private enterprises but that discretion may be used where an officeholder is the official guest of another Government or official body or of a not-for-profit representative organisation or the like.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">For obvious reasons, restrictions in the code of conduct for officeholders do not apply to any offer or supply of property or a service made in the course of and for the purpose of performance of duties of an officeholder.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">The Department of Finance's code of practice for the governance of State bodies, which was recently updated and re-issued on 15 June,  provides a framework for the application of best practice in corporate governance by both commercial and non-commercial State bodies.  The code lays down that all State bodies should have written codes of business conduct for their directors and employees and makes clear that such a code should address as a fundamental issue of principle avoidance of giving or receiving corporate gifts, hospitality, preferential treatment or benefits which may affect or appear to affect the ability of a donor or the recipient to make independent judgment on business transactions.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">The code of practice reminds directors and employees of State bodies that they should be guided by the principles set out in the code in meeting their responsibilities to ensure that all their activities, whether covered specifically or otherwise in the code, meet the highest standards of corporate governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_65">In certain circumstances, receipt of hospitality could constitute a gift.  If a Minister were to receive a gift worth more than €650 from a State agency, it would be deemed to be a gift given by virtue of office and would have to be surrendered to the State.  It would also have to be declared in the Minister's annual statement of registerable interests.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_46">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_66">I did not catch all of the Taoiseach's reply.  FÁS, which was a case in point, has received massive coverage in recent months and for good reason.  There was clearly a lack of oversight and judgment as to what was going on in that organisation.  I referred yesterday to the comments by the Taoiseach about the former chief executive and noted that the Tánaiste appeared to know very little about what was going on in FÁS.  In view of the very changed circumstances in which we find ourselves in regard to the performance of public duties by Ministers and agencies associated with the State, what changes in oversight does the Government propose to introduce to ensure these kinds of excesses cannot happen again?</p>
            <p eId="para_67">The Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 went through the Seanad on 4 July 2007 — two years ago — and is still on the Order Paper for the Dáil.  As the Taoiseach is aware, its main provision is to increase the value of gifts that Ministers and parliamentarians can receive.  Instead of taking the suggestions made by the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007, published by the Department of Finance, which was under the stewardship of the Taoiseach at the time, focused entirely on the provision of gifts to Ministers and parliamentary officeholders.  The legislation raised the value of gifts which had to be declared to the Standards in Public Office Commission for a declaration that the gift would be unlikely to influence the recipient in the performance of his or her duties from, I understand, €650 to €2,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">That is a considerable purchase fee for a gift or item for an officeholder or whatever Minister might be involved.  In view of the circumstances we now find ourselves in, is it proposed to reduce that limit and have only token gifts or awards made to Ministers?</p>
            <p eId="para_69">I am sure some of those on the other side have attics filled with bog deal, glass bowls and mirrors of all descriptions which were awarded to Ministers such as the Minister, Deputy Cullen, when they cut tapes here and there.  All I am asking is for the situation to be regularised.  I am sure the Minister does not want to do a round of ten different hotels and have a little plaque given to him.  He would be far better off going off, saying his piece and saying he does not want anything.</p>

One could go to any gift shop down town and buy a substantial gift for €2,000.  The value of such gifts, which might influence a Minister in the performance of his or her duties, must be between €650 and €2,000.  What oversight regulations will be changed and put in place and is it proposed to go along with this Bill, which raises the limit from €650 to €2,000?  It went through the Seanad two years ago and is still on the Dáil Order Paper.  It is in the Taoiseach's interest to clarify this.</p>

Regarding the whole question of thresholds and limits, the threshold of €650 had not been increased since 1995.  The idea was to make sure that it would be dealt with in a way that did not involve the commission in the valuation of every gift that would be obtained.  On the question of amendments and what people want to do regarding amendments on the size of these gifts, it is a matter which can be debated in the House.  It is not an issue which I am holding fast on.</p>

            <p eId="para_81">The Taoiseach should send out an instruction to his Ministers and Ministers of State to be very careful about what they receive as gifts for duties they perform in respect of their Departments.  The Taoiseach is probably aware of one former Minister who had to have the attic in his house strengthened to hold all the gifts which were awarded to him over the years.  I am sure he knows the person of whom I am speaking.  I am making the point that it is in the interests of all members of the Cabinet and Ministers of State that the situation be regularised, because if the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, receives a crystal globe for something he does in County Leitrim, what is it worth?  He has to declare it.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">He should instruct the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, to bring the Bill before the House.  He is the Government Chief Whip.  I heard him speak eloquently on the radio the other night, when he said his main priority was to get the legislative list right.  He gave an eloquent description of what the Government has to do.  I suggest the Taoiseach bring this Bill, which was debated in the Seanad two years ago, before the House and let us amend it to a point where no Minister or Minister of State can ever be accused in any circumstances, under the declaration of this Bill, of being put on the spot.  I am not suggesting anybody is.</p>

            <p eId="para_83">The Bill does not do that.  Legislation is already in place which deals with gifts to Ministers in the performance of their duties.  That is covered.  This relates to the question of people who, when they are not in the public performance of their duties, receive gifts from friends or associated people.  It covers a much wider and different situation than the public performance of duties.  The public performance of duties issue is not changed by this Bill.  It is important to note that a particular issue arose in regard to that legislation and we have to deal with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_85">Extravagance and the waste of taxpayers' money is never acceptable.  Does the Taoiseach agree that in the current economic climate, where people are losing their jobs and people's incomes are under pressure and they are finding it hard to make ends meet, that the kind of lavish expenditure we have now become aware was going on over a number of years is particularly unacceptable?  Would he agree that the era of the €900 hotel room must now be a thing of the past and that it is necessary to convey to the public that that day is over?  One way of doing that would be progressing the new ethics Bill which has been lying around for three years?  On 10 October 2006 the then Minister, Deputy McDowell, told the media that the new ethics Bill was to be brought before the Oireachtas as a matter of urgency.  It came before the Seanad but was not brought before this House.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">The Taoiseach makes it sound as if the reason it has not come before the House is due to a scheduling difficulty between the Whips.  Clearly, a political decision has been taken that this Bill will not be progressed.  I have never seen a Bill lying around as long as this one.  I agree with Deputy Kenny on the raising of the thresholds, which is something I do not agree with.  It would provide an opportunity for the House to address some of these issues in a legislative way and it should be brought before the House as soon as possible.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_87">The issue has been dealt with through the Houses of the Oireachtas and has not been proceeded with.  When it will be taken is a matter for the Whips and the Minister for Finance.  The issue of what thresholds would apply now is a matter for decision on Committee Stage.  The idea behind it was that there was a gap in the situation regarding people who provide gifts who were friends of an officeholder but did not do so in the context of the performance of duties.  This Bill was provided to fill those gaps.  That was the idea behind it, as I recall.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">On the more general and important point, it is very important that whatever arrangements for officeholders which have been long-standing under successive Administrations be reviewed in the context of the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I do not think anybody in the House would suggest otherwise.  The Minister for Finance, in June or July, provided a circular on updated guidelines on travel and what arrangements are put in place.  It takes account of how air tickets can be booked at the best possible cost for the taxpayer.  These developments took place when guidelines on the old arrangements had not been sufficiently updated.  That is being done.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">In every aspect of what we do we have to be clear and transparent and I am in favour of transparency, as is the Government.  We are anxious to proceed.  As the Deputy knows, the commission has had some proposals.  The Minister for Finance has a view regarding the verification of what was proposed.  I am sure it was proposed in good faith.  He has taken a view that there are further considerations to be given to that to improve the verification procedure rather than the composite block grant proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">I heard a suggestion this morning that he was in some way blocking this progress.  In fact, he is seeking to ensure that we meet the standards the public will expect, in terms of verification of these matters.  He is advancing it.  While everyone puts forward proposals in good faith, whether it is members of the commission or whatever, it should not then be portrayed as if there is a blocking mechanism on the Government side.  The Government side is trying to ensure that we meet the requirements the public would expect in these matters, even beyond what has already been proposed.  It is only fair to say that.  Let us have that discussion and debate and bring it to a conclusion.  We would like to bring it to a conclusion quickly.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">The Taoiseach is mixing up two areas of expenditure.  As I understand it, the recommendations made by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to the Minister for Finance relate to the expenses of Members of the House in their capacity as Members of the House.  I repeat I am disappointed the Minister has not approved the package that was recommended to him some time ago.  As I understand it, the Minister was given the legislative authority to do so in legislation that was passed by the Oireachtas.  The expenditure incurred by officeholders — Ministers and Ministers of State — is a separate matter.  It is striking that Ministers and Ministers of State are always at the bottom of the league tables of expenses that are published periodically in newspapers, etc.  They are at the bottom for the very good reason that their expenses do not go through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Will the Taoiseach agree, in the interests of transparency and so that everybody can see what is going on, to provide that details of the expenses incurred by officeholders and associated with such offices are made available in the same way as the expenses of Members of the Oireachtas are made public?</p>

            <p eId="para_92">When Deputy Gilmore raised his first matter, he expressed his disappointment at the failure of the Minister for Finance to approve a proposal that had been made.  I remind him that the Minister has expressed his views on whether the proposal meets the transparency requirements he considers necessary in this case.  The suggestion being made — that the Minister's failure to approve the proposal meant in some way that he was indifferent to this issue, that he was lax on the issue, or that he did not share the high standards being proposed by others in this regard — is not true, not fair, not just and not right.</p>

            <p eId="para_94">We will leave it at that.  Although it was suggested that the Minister was blocking an improvement, the truth is that he wanted to advance it beyond what has been suggested.  That is the first point.  Given that the Minister's position was not being reflected in full, it is only fair to speak in his defence.  The second point relates to the question of ministerial expenses.  As I have said, mechanisms like the Freedom of Information Acts are being used to provide information.  I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to bolster public confidence in that respect.  It has been mentioned that when certain figures are provided, it is important to explain the context in which officeholders incur their expenses.</p>

The problem is that all of these matters are sometimes portrayed in a manner that is unfair on everybody.  It is important for the public to understand that the moneys spent by those who act on behalf of taxpayers are accounted for in a transparent manner.  I am totally in favour of such a system.  If people are to know what it is about, it needs to be explained rather than simply thrown out there.  As Deputy Gilmore said, people tend to think that those who are paid larger expenses enjoy lavish lifestyles.  The reality is that those who do not have similar responsibilities do not incur similar expenses.</p>

            <p eId="para_99">We are aware of how public funding was abused by the board of FÁS.  For example, some Ministers availed of expensive junkets to Florida.  There needs to be a full debate in the Dáil on the issue of ministerial accountability.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the Whips that such a debate will be arranged at some stage?  We need to deal with the point the Taoiseach has made about explaining the context in which expenses are paid.  Why did three Ministers and two Ministers of State travel to Florida for ceremonies associated with the FÁS science challenge project, which has an annual budget of €1.5 million, over a period of less than three years between 2004 and 2007?  Will the Taoiseach admit that the trips were simply junkets?  The Cabinet handbook states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_100">Where the nature of a visit requires that a Minister be accompanied by his/her spouse/partner, he/she should consult the Taoiseach in advance on the matter.  Expenses in respect of a spouse/partner will not be charged to public funds in any particular case unless the Taoiseach is satisfied that, in the circumstances, this is warranted.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">Is this rule adhered to?  Does the Taoiseach routinely sign off on trips by spouses or partners?  Can he estimate how many such trips were warranted since 2007?  How does he determine whether expenses for spouses or partners are warranted?</p>

            <p eId="para_103">I thank the Chair.  In the absence of advance notice, I cannot answer specific questions that would be best addressed to individual Ministers.  Officeholders can have representational roles in respect of State agencies, in addition to their departmental responsibilities.  One may be required to promote the interests of the agencies under one's aegis.  It should be acknowledged that the promotion of what such organisations are doing or seeking to do can be a valid exercise of one's responsibilities.  I cannot go into the specific details.  The Tánaiste undertook to investigate this matter on foot of controversies about travel interests that arose last November.  I understand that the programme mentioned by Deputy Ó Snodaigh was discontinued on the advice of the Tánaiste.  She insisted that it be discontinued as she did not believe it was sufficiently warranted in the circumstances in which the organisation found itself at that time.  That is my recollection of the situation.  Spouses can have a representational role from time to time.  For example, it is sometimes regarded as appropriate for the accompanying Minister on a presidential visit to be accompanied by his or her spouse.  There may be other instances in which it is deemed that the right thing to do, in the circumstances that are arising, is to envisage an itinerary for a ministerial spouse.  The guidelines, by definition, require discretion.  One cannot be absolutely rigid on this; instead, one makes a decision on the basis of the relevant circumstances.  I can only answer the Deputy's question about these arrangements with reference to my experience since I first held this office.  Since I took office, I understand there may have been two or three occasions on which that was required.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_104">Can I ask the Taoiseach about the incurring of expenses?  As an inevitable result of the development of devolved bodies and organisations, which has been a strong feature of public administration in Ireland over the last 20 years, many Ministers now carry out official functions and visits through such bodies and organisations.  As semi-State bodies and organisations are not accountable to the Dáil in the same direct way as a Department of State, there is enormous scope for what some people might consider to be the hiding of expenditure.  In general, journalists do not become aware of such expenditure unless they use the freedom of information provisions.  I suggest, in the interests of restoring public confidence, that officeholders and senior executives in public service Departments, as well as the devolved bodies and semi-State companies, etc., should be required to publish on a quarterly basis a summary of the expenses they have incurred in respect of matters like entertainment and travel.  I suspect that the expenses claimed within most bodies are relatively modest.  I hope the cases of over-the-top and extravagant expenses are exceptions.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">A practice has developed regarding entertainment budgets of people making extensive use of credit cards.  Would it not be wise to introduce a daily limit on credit card spending for senior departmental officials, including the private secretaries who administer ministerial travel and entertainment budgets?  That would be a practical way of reining in spending and, where a particular entertainment or travel expense is liable to be high, ensuring that thought is given to whether the amount involved is excessive.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">The Department of Finance reviewed the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and issued a revised and updated code on 15 June to include revised guidelines on travel policy for Departments and State bodies which take due account of the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I understand a further report on FÁS is due to be issued in respect of the internal audits.  The conclusions drawn from that report will inform the committee's considerations and the Department of Finance in terms of the lessons to be learned.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">Officeholders also have to abide by a code of conduct.  Everyone is mindful that taxpayers' money should be spent in the most economic and fair manner possible and that extravagance should be avoided.  Strong involvement is sometimes advocated in regard to arrangements but those who have had the privilege of holding office, including Deputy Burton, will be aware that arrangements are put in place for the conduct of work and it is not a question of Ministers seeking to augment itineraries.  The itineraries are set out and Ministers do their work in the hope and expectation that everything is in order.  Clearly, these traditional arrangements have to be reviewed in light of the context in which we are now operating because we want to maintain the trust and confidence of the people we govern and the taxpayers and electorate we represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">There is on occasion an inclination to suggest that a particular issue or individual was involved when perhaps it is a matter of reviewing a systemic practice across the board.  Too often, debate concerns the person rather than the issue.  We need to be mindful of that because it is not in our interest to follow practices which are not consistent with the requirements of the country's current situation or which undermine confidence in the institutions in which we participate.  Issues can be validly raised and debated but we need to avoid giving an incorrect or unfair impression.  At the same time, the system has to respond in an appropriate and proportionate way to the fact that we are in different circumstances.  That needs to be reflected in everything we do.  This is not the view of any particular section of this House but is shared by all Deputies.</p>

In view of the outsourcing of these activities, have staff been moved from the Department of the Taoiseach to other Departments?</p>

            <p eId="para_116">The role of the Department of Finance does not rule out the need for us to assign people to these areas because we have co-ordinating, leadership and other responsibilities.  I do not accept the contention that the social partnership process has been abandoned.  It is an important function in terms of providing a structure within which relationships and interests can be negotiated.  It is wrong to regard a process which has helped to provide stability, and which will continue to do so in the future, as the fall guy for all our problems.  Difficult issues have to be negotiated in any event and the process is wider than the traditional area of pay and conditions for public servants.  Negotiations on wider inputs into policy and positions are in line with promoting good democratic practice and they should continue.  The fact that we cannot guarantee unanimity does not undermine the process.  The preferred outcome of discussions is agreement, however.  The references made in certain quarters are rather denigratory in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">In regard to economic and other affairs, the Department of the Taoiseach is relatively small in terms of personnel and costs given the level of responsibility assigned to it.  While we continue to work with other Departments on controlling the cost of the public service, we also undertake important functions which require the input of competent and adequate personnel.</p>

He stated that it would include consideration of the proposals of the McCarthy report, for instance.  What is the process for such consideration of that report in his Department?  Is the Department of Finance anchoring that process?  Is the Department of the Taoiseach or any other Department in dialogue with the Department of Finance regarding those proposals?  These are the proposals contained in a report which caused consternation throughout the country, especially in most disadvantaged areas because it proposed savage and illogical cuts in health, education, social welfare and a range of services such as CDPs and family resource centres.  What role will Members of the House have in such consideration of that report in the context of planned expenditure levels in his Department in the next few months but, in particular, for next year?</p>

            <p eId="para_136">I appointed the Innovation Taskforce on 29 June last.  The task force has been asked, in the context of the Government's framework for sustainable economic renewal, Building Ireland's Smart Economy, and the strategy for science, technology and innovation, to: examine options to increase levels of innovation and the rates of commercialisation of research and development on a national basis with a view to accelerating the growth and scale-up of indigenous enterprise and to attract new knowledge-intensive direct investment; bring forward proposals for enhancing the linkages between institutions, agencies and organisations in the public and private sectors to ensure a cohesive innovation and commercialisation ecosystem; and identify any specific policy measures which might be necessary to support the concept of Ireland as an international innovation development hub including in the areas of legislation, educational policy, intellectual property arrangements, venture capital and immigration policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">The task force members have a wide range of expertise and include individuals with global experience in international companies and entrepreneurs who have recently established and grown successful start-up companies.  There is also representation from the higher education sector and senior representatives from a number of Departments and agencies.  A full list of members is being circulated with this reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">The task force has established four working groups focusing on more specific aspects of its terms of reference.  It has also undertaken a public consultation process giving groups and individuals the opportunity to provide relevant views or submissions for consideration.  The closing date for submissions was 18 September and approximately 100 have been received.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">The next meeting of the task force is on 30 October and it is expected that the task force will report early in the new year.</p>

            <p eId="para_170">The Taoiseach stated that he expected the group would report by beginning of next year, and I presume its report will be published.

            <p eId="para_172">Will the task force be mindful of the problems which were associated with the Media Lab debacle, for instance, the problems which arose when the State tried to encourage the likes of Media Lab to Ireland.  In the area where Media Lab located, the rest of the Digital Hub project is highly successful and has managed to attract quite a number of businesses.  Would the Taoiseach encourage the innovation taskforce to look at that model but also to address the problems and failures that they have encountered in terms of not having enough space to attract to the area more small indigenous businesses, which are developing innovation and which have been highly successful in terms of the smart economy?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_93">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_173">It is important to point out that we have learned lessons as we have sought to address this area.  Unfortunately, ten or 15 years ago we were providing little or no money into this area.  It is now a significant part of investment.  On the question of Science Foundation Ireland being set up, I note how highly credible is the good peer review that goes on there and how well it is regarded.  All of the PRTLI investment has been relatively recent, in the past decade or decade and a half.  This innovation is now about how we commercialise research and development and how we assist start-up companies because it is only those companies who can move forward, innovate and reposition themselves which will be able to be in business.  These might be different businesses than what they were originally when they were founded.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">Adding value and providing greater productivity through innovation is the means by which we can effect recovery in many respects.  That is not simply about science laboratories and PhDs; it is about the culture of innovation right across the economy and the need for everybody, in whatever work they do and however mundane the service they provide, to look at how we deliver service and how we can do so in a more streamlined, effective and efficient way.  It is as important an agenda for the public service as it is for the private sector.  In fact, it is a hugely important agenda and the transforming public services project is about trying to inculcate that culture of innovation constantly as a matter of course, moving beyond organisational boundaries and getting people to co-ordinate and work together.  That is what innovation is about.  It is about doing things better and more efficiently and getting greater productivity for the amount of resources being applied.  There may be cases in which initiatives fail or are not as successful as we had hoped.  That is the nature of risk-taking.  There is no guarantee of success for every initiative that seeks to develop innovation or technology.  Some technology companies fail; some prosper and become multinationals.  That is the nature of the risk.  We must ensure we manage risk in the context of using public moneys but we must also be prepared to take a chance in certain areas in an effort to achieve success and contribute to good outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_175">I opened a conference on wind energy in Galway on Thursday last, the day before the referendum.  There were 300 people there, including investors, innovators and people with real drive.  The analysis given at the conference was that this country has some of the best locations in the world in terms of mean wind speeds, which is beneficial for wind energy.  I support the concept of a task force on innovation, which is interesting and good.  If we are to develop renewable energy sources such as wind, pumped storage, waves or tides, we must first deal with the grid.  There is no point in trying to do this on a piece-by-piece basis in various parts of the country.  It is a real problem for everybody.</p>
            <p eId="para_176">If we aspire to putting in infrastructure and capacity all over the country as a result of the deliberations of the task force on innovation, this cannot happen unless we deal with the grid.  Has the task force taken this into account in respect of the locations it proposes for particular types of innovation?  There is no reason this country should not be a world centre in the development of wind energy.  As has been pointed out by others, we could be exporting energy in a relatively short time if we get it right.  However, this cannot happen, irrespective of the good work the innovation task force may do or moneys the Government draws from the innovation fund, if there are problems with the grid.  This is a real problem and it must be analysed and focused on in everybody's interest.</p>

            <p eId="para_177">Opportunities for development of the green economy generally are central to the vision for a smart economy, which recognises the need to move to a low-carbon society, drawing on our natural resources to tackle the interrelated challenges of climate change and energy security.  We are making progress on the question of how we can build a sustainable energy industry in our own country.  Targets are being met and there has been much investment, not only by companies such as the ESB but also by other companies entering the field.  We do have identifiable advantages in wave and wind energy, which we need to harness, and we are in the process of developing these in the context of an all-island electricity market.  The innovation task force is not related directly to that sector but it will provide assistance to those who wish to achieve innovation right across the economy, in terms of fiscal ideas as well as the generation of innovation within companies, change management, and a range of other issues that are fundamental in moving to a different way of doing things.  Greater effectiveness and efficiency will result in higher productivity.</p>

If I recall correctly, in July 1980 the late Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan died in office while the Dáil was in recess, and the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, decided to appoint a member of his Cabinet, Pádraig Faulkner, as the Ceann Comhairle.  The person occupying this seat at the time, Garret FitzGerald, objected to the fact that the Taoiseach had not consulted with him, although he did not object to Mr. Faulkner's appointment.  The Labour Party did not object either.  In fact, I think he was elected unanimously.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">Has the Taoiseach informed the Parliament of the Czech Republic that Ireland has approved the Lisbon treaty in a referendum?  The intention is not to put pressure on the Czech Republic but to remind it that the Lisbon treaty cannot be fully signed off until it and Poland have finalised the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">I also ask the Taoiseach for further clarification of his remarks to Deputy Gilmore this morning.  If other parties or Members of the House consider certain persons to be suitable for nomination by the Government to the post of European Commissioner, what is the process for bringing this to the Taoiseach's attention?  Is this done verbally or by written affirmation?  There are a number of people I could recommend who would guarantee this country a senior portfolio.  As the Taoiseach knows, there are 27 commissionerships to give out and they cannot all be responsible for finance or other important areas.  While they act in the European interest, it is important for Irish people to know there is someone out there who understands the nature of the work to be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I did not inform any parliament of the outcome of the referendum, which is well known in all these countries.  It was well known even before the official announcement was made that the people of Ireland had approved the treaty.  Tomorrow the formal procedure will be carried out without debate and the instrument of ratification will be forwarded in due course to Rome, where the relevant papers are held.  I intend to do this before the European Council meets in the next few weeks so we can confirm we have met all requirements.  Other countries are carrying out their own internal ratification procedures and it is not for me to remind people of that, since this country has had its own ratification procedure over a prolonged period.  It is a matter for the Presidency and the Commission to deal with those issues in the normal way in terms of expediting the matter and bringing clarity to the process for appointing a Commission.  Institutional certainty is also required as part of the preparations for the transition to a new Commission in the aftermath of the ratification of the treaty by all 27 member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">I made the point yesterday that the appointment of a High Representative, who will now become a member of the Commission under the new treaty arrangements, is another consideration for the President of the Commission, Mr. Barroso, before finalising his arrangements for the composition of the Commission.  Under the Treaty of Lisbon this is a matter for designation by the European Council.  That matter will also have to be addressed in that forum before we finalise the Commission procedures.</p>

While I do not have the same facilitation as other party leaders in the Opposition <i>vis-a-vis</i> Leaders’ Questions I, too, wished to refer to the fact that Sinn Féin has tabled a motion on the Order Paper which has not made its way to the scheduling of business for today.  That motion relates to the position of the Ceann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">It is our intention that our motion will stand.  While I accept that I have no way of pressing to have this motion taken in the House — I spoke about this matter to the Chief Whip last evening — it was our wish that this matter be dealt with today.  We are not happy with the deferment of the Ceann Comhairle's resignation.  It should take effect as of today, which is the appropriate time in this regard.  The Ceann Comhairle would subsequently have had ample opportunity to address outstanding issues in the tidying up of his affairs in that office.  It is not appropriate that this matter is being allowed to continue on for another week.  That is our position.</p>

On the basis of the Ceann Comhairle having made his decision it was reasonable he be given space and time to prepare a statement for the House as he was not afforded the opportunity to do so at a proposed meeting of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission today.  The Ceann Comhairle must also be given time to make arrangements in regard to office personnel and so on.

          <p eId="para_277">Is Bille rí-thábhachtach é seo.  Mar a dúirt mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Morgan, nuair a bhí sé ag labhairt faoi seo, ní chóir go mbeadh sé os ár gcomhair in aon chor, ach tá sé ann.  Tá deis agam impí ar an Rialtas, fiú ag an stad seo, é a tharraingt siar.  Caithfidh an Rialtas éisteacht ceart a thabhairt do mholtaí na ndaoine ar cad ba chóir dúinn a dhéanamh leis an slám mór airgid a chuirfear ar strae má théimid síos bóthar NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Inné, d'eisigh mé preasráiteas mar gheall ar iad siúd le morgáistí.  Dúirt an ESRI go mbeidh 35,000 duine i gcruachás maidir leis an morgáiste atá acu, ó thaobh a dtithe de, sa bhliain atá amach romhainn.  Más fíor sin, tá fadhb mhór ag teacht romhainn sa Stát seo muna dhéanaimid rud éigin chun déanamh cinnte de nach mbeidh 35,000 teach gafa ag na bainc nó na comhlachtaí morgáistí a thug iad sin dóibh.  Cuirfear 35,000 clann amach ar an sráid, os rud é nach féidir leo a morgáistí a íoc, muna dhéanaimid rud éigin.  Dúirt mé gur chóir dúinn féachaint ar conas is féidir linn déileáil le seo i gceart.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">This is not just about figures in the air and NAMA, but about real lives.  Yesterday, the ESRI stated that 35,000 people would be unable to pay their mortgages next year.  That is a shocking indictment of Government policies during the Celtic tiger years.  People bought their homes at the height of the boom and they are not to blame for the situation in which they find themselves, struggling to maintain mortgages on what were once hyper-inflated properties.  Yesterday's report is an indictment.  In those years, successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments, the Central Bank and the management in those banks which are now before the Government with a begging bowl, encouraged people and forced families in many cases to pay hyper-inflated prices for their properties, or pay hyper-rents.  There was no alternative, because the investment required for social housing was not there.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I disagree with the ESRI's suggestion that people who run into difficulties should have their mortgage rescheduled.  Many of these people bought their properties in the last five or ten years.  Many of them did so because the Central Bank allowed 100% mortgages and even 110% mortgages in some cases.  These people now have a noose around their necks.  They also have 35 to 40 year mortgages, because that option was encouraged to get everybody into the property market, as if the Celtic tiger would never slow down or never die.  It is not an option for those with 35 or 40 year mortgages to re-mortgage.  What will happen to them?  There is no social housing to pick up the tab that the Government should have picked up.  There is no empty social housing around the country which would take this up.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The banks that lent so recklessly and the developers who coined the money at the height of the boom should share the pain these people are facing.  If people run into difficulties in repaying their mortgages, then an option could be to reduce the costs of the mortgage more in line with the actual value of the home.  I did a quick calculation on some of the banks' submissions on NAMA and used a geographical breakdown to lift the number of mortgages in the Twenty-six Counties out of the figures that were presented to us by the Minister a few weeks ago.  The total residential lending of the five banks covered by NAMA — I am excluding Anglo Irish Bank as it lent very little for residential mortgages — came to about €100.25 billion.  If we accept that roughly one third of those people took their mortgages out in the last five or six years, then that comes to about €33 billion.  We should set the banks a task of reducing all of those mortgages by 30% to make them affordable and to prevent families from defaulting on a mortgage.  If those banks reduced those mortgages by 30%, we could set the conditions and limitations on this kind of renegotiations, so that it will only be for houses worth €600,000 or less.  That is not a great cost when compared with what we are doing to bail out speculators and developers, but it would address huge problems that the State will be facing in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">I remember when many people — myself included — gambled on the stock market through Eircom shares.  We were all encouraged to take out Eircom shares, because it was a sure thing.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_284">I made that choice.  I gambled, I suffered, I lost.  These property developers gambled on a property market, yet the taxpayer is expected to bail them out.  There was no bail out for shareholders in Eircom, yet we will bail out speculators like Liam Carroll, Sean Dunne and others we are getting to know as their court appearances take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I asked that Members who have shares in the banks declare their interests when speaking in the Dáil.  I also asked that they should exclude themselves, because they have a vested interest in NAMA succeeding.  To my knowledge, nobody has acknowledged that they have shares in the banks.  Their excuse is that they publish their interests in the register of interests every year.  That register of interests needs to be reviewed in a case like this where people have a vested interest in bailing out the banks so that their shares can go up and they can benefit.  These are not small amounts of shares.  These are shares that must be declared because they are valued at over €13,000 per annum.  It is a simple thing to do.  A Member should stand up and state that he or she has an interest, but would like to debate the Bill in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">There is significant misinformation coming from the Government about the figures on NAMA.  The lie that NAMA will only pay €7 billion over the odds for the bad loans being bought back from the banks is truly shameful.  The Government claims that NAMA is buying €77 billion worth of loans, but that the true value of these loans would be €88 billion.  The developers who borrowed €77 billion actually bought €88 billion worth of property.  They say those are the figures, but last week's "Prime Time" programme demonstrated that argument was nonsense and there was nothing we did not already know.  In most cases the developers were getting deposits for the loans secured on properties from other banks.  Therefore, the whole argument is incorrect.  NAMA used a figure of €88 billion to work down to a figure of €47 billion to be paid by the State plus a further €7 billion.  It says this has allowed a 47% drop in property prices and that is the value and we will all benefit from it, perhaps in ten years time.  There are two problems with this argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The recent Liam Carroll-Zoe Developments case with the ACC Bank made the front pages when the Ceann Comhairle was not on them.  The judge took the view that if the company sold all its properties in a fire sale, they would only sell for 25% of their value.  This, therefore is their value.  The State should take this figure of 25% as the value of bank properties because this is a fire sale.  We should not pay more than what the courts are willing to accept.  We should pay €22 billion maximum for these types of properties so that we do not end up having to force our property market to recreate a bubble to ensure we get a return benefit from the properties we acquire.  Therefore, €22 billion is the figure we should pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">If we accept that the NAMA legislation will pass and if it pays that €22 billion, that will leave us with €30 billion or so that the State was willing to throw away into speculators pockets that could be used for something else.  I will put forward some radical  but realistic suggestions for how that money could be used to benefit the State for the foreseeable future and underlie a basis for the new economy required for the country.  Most Deputies have seen or received e-mails about a proposal termed Spirit of Ireland, a radical proposal to ensure security of energy.  Energy security is a major issue throughout the world and every economy wants to ensure that when oil and fossil fuels run out or prices go out of kilter, they will have their own sources of energy.  The Spirit of Ireland proposal would employ tens of thousands of people for up to ten years in the construction phase and also provide security of energy for the future.  I urge the Government to consider investing this type of money into that project rather than into NAMA.  The advantage of this would be we would not only get energy security, but would also make a profit which could then go to other projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Last week I listened to some of those involved in the roll-out of broadband.  They said €4 billion — a significant amount — would underpin the knowledge and smart economy we are trying to develop.  We could position ourselves well if that was rolled out properly and if investment was put into state-of-the-art broadband, rather than the hotchpotch type of broadband we have currently where one house can get it and the one next door cannot.  The cost of approximately €4 billion would supply state-of-the-art broadband to every house, business and school in the country.  This money could come from the saving made if the Minister did not take the ridiculous route of spending huge amounts that should not be spent on bailing out the banks.  It could come from the €20 billion or €30 billion savings made if the Minister paid 25% rather than 47%.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">We could also spend the savings on capital projects such as building proper schools, removing prefabs and finishing road projects and transport infrastructure that will help us become more dependent on public transport rather than on private cars which burn more fossil fuels.  That is the type of investment required and a further benefit is that this creates employment.  The Government may not be able to remember the benefits that come from creating employment as it is so long since it put a proper job creation project together.  People pay tax when they are employed and they have extra money in their pockets to spend.  The Government benefits again from their spending, through VAT returns and then suddenly we have an Exchequer benefiting from having people in employment rather than having to spend its money on dole queues.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I also propose the Government should set aside proper funds for seed capital.  The current funding of €500 million or €200 million will not go far.  If we are to invest and plan for the future, we need to put proper seed capital in place so that small and medium enterprises and indigenous companies can avail of money to help them get on the road to becoming profitable and paying back in corporation or other taxes in the future.  Otherwise, they sit on their ideas and somebody somewhere else around the world will develop the idea and make the profits.  These are practical proposals the Government should accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">I said earlier there were two problems with regard to the Government using the figure of €88 billion to work down to €47 billion.  The second problem is that the Government seems to assume that property prices have bottomed out.  It assumes that everything will either stay the same for a while or start to rise.  I do not understand the basis for this.  If one reads the property pages, one sees prices are still coming down.  If one watches auction prices, one sees prices still decreasing.  Anybody who goes into areas where houses have been waiting to be sold for the past year and a half knows property prices are still going downwards and will continue to do so.  The same is true for commercial and industrial property.  The presumption of a rise is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">We have 400,000 people on dole queues and that number is increasing.  Where are the people who will buy the houses?  The banks are not lending money for them, but apart from that more people are unemployed and therefore cannot afford or will not be allowed to avail of a mortgage.  Also, people in insecure jobs or on three-day working weeks cannot take out mortgages.  The dole queues do not include the people whose hours have been reduced slightly.  Economists such as Morgan Kelly and David McWilliams do not believe prices have bottomed out.  I agree and do not think we will see a bottoming out of prices for another year or so.  At that stage, we will be very close to the 25% value the banks put on Liam Carroll's property.  The figure of 25% is the value we should consider if we are going down the NAMA road to ensure the best value for money is obtained by the State.  The additional money the Government was willing to spend or throw away on NAMA should be spent on projects such as those I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">In addition, some 36% of NAMA's loans will solely be on land.  Land values have fallen even faster and further than property values, particularly where there is nothing on the land.  If over one third of the bad loans are on land, the 30% discount is even further away from the ballpark figure.  I will deal with the issue of land value further on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I wish to raise a number of questions with regard to local authorities, which are owed millions of euro by companies on development lands.  The local authorities had planned to spend this money, but where will it come from now?  Can they go to NAMA and look for their development levies?  There is also an issue with regard to derelict sites.  For example, in Dublin the local authority can proceed through derelict sites legislation and compulsorily purchase land that is empty.  If land that becomes the property of NAMA remains derelict can local authorities compulsorily purchase it from NAMA, which is not the State?  What happens to major projects such as the Cherry Orchard regeneration project?  That is totally stalled because the plan was based on lands which will probably now end up in NAMA.  That means that everything in Cherry Orchard will grind to a halt until such time as somebody sells off the land NAMA will take and starts to invest and build on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">There are enormous problems in relation to NAMA and major questions which I do not believe the Government will be able to address.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">He can see the rest of my contribution on the monitor.  I did not buy Eircom shares, either.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation as regards the NAMA Bill.  I want to take up a couple of points that were raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  This is not a question, and never has been, of a  bailout for developers, builders or banks.  This is about the real economy.  NAMA is about getting the flow of credit back into the real economy.  It has been lost on much of the commentary that every cent owed to a bank now remains owed under NAMA.  NAMA is not purchasing the properties, but rather taking the loans.  It is not a question of writing off loans or doing anything like that.  As regards what happened to Zoe Developments in the courts this week, NAMA would have taken an exactly similar approach.  Anyone with a non-performing loan such as that would be shut down, too.  In that context it is important to note that the valuation that the Minister gave in his speech a couple of weeks ago was an estimate.  Before a loan can be transferred to NAMA it will be individually valued and it is crucially important that people know that.  If a piece of land is currently zoned residential, for instance, and there is no prospect of it ever being developed, it will be purchased at agricultural prices.  It is as simple as that, so we are not overpaying for assets.  We actually cannot overpay for the loans because this is against EU state aid rules.  This process has been agreed with the European Commission as well, so it is not as if the Government has acted alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The Government has looked at different types of options including nationalisation and various issues such as that.  The very last thing we want to do is to immediately nationalise.  Straightaway, we would probably have to pay compensation of approximately €4 billion to bank shareholders before anything could be done or any capital could be injected into the banks.  Another point not dealt with properly by commentators, who have not given it the credit it is due, is the fact that NAMA is not a bad bank.  Both performing and non-performing loans will come into its portfolio and approximately 45% of the loans to be transferred to NAMA are fully performing.  The others are stress loans.  In that regard Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to a 25% valuation.  That type of thinking would automatically bring about a fire sale.  That is what this is about.  Nobody in the economy or on the street wants a fire sale of properties across the board.  We have to be able to manage this process well.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">It is not a question that anyone wants to do this, but rather a fact that it has to be done, for the good of the real economy, including the 1.8 million or 1.9 million people working in it and the viable businesses that all Members of the House know cannot access credit.  This is a continuing problem.  The choices to be made were either to allow the banks five to ten years to trade through their problems, while every other business in the country was being strangled by having their overdrafts cut, being unable to access credit and not being able to trade properly.  The knock-on effect of this is that invoices are paid later and the flow of cash slows down.  We saw that in the report last week on average values.  Only one in five invoices is being paid within a 30-day period and the reason is that viable businesses cannot access cash.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The importance of NAMA and what the Government is proposing cannot be overstated.  I expect there will be amendments on Committee Stage and I hope the Opposition will engage in a responsible manner in this regard — with viable amendments.  One aspect I should particularly like to see dealt with is lending to the business sector, especially the SMEs.  Where possible this should be tied into the legislation on Committee Stage.  Most people will see the problems businesses encounter on a daily basis.  These need to be addressed.  The longer businesses are functioning without proper access to credit, the more difficult will it be for recovery.  It is clear from the figures that NAMA will pay for itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">NAMA is not a massive gamble.  It has been established in other states and will work well here.  Events this time next year will show that.  With regard to the idea of a recovery bank as proposed by Fine Gael in particular, one aspect that is forgotten in that process is the loans that are sitting on the books.  There is no proposal to deal with them——</p>

          <p eId="para_313">I hope that the engagement that happens with the Opposition on Committee Stage will give rise to some viable amendments being tabled.  Everyone agrees we have a problem that has to be dealt with and we cannot just allow it to sit.  Nationalisation should be the very last thing we do, because it would cost the taxpayer more.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The Fine Gael proposal does not stack up.  The proposal that stacks up is the National Asset Management Agency.  What is crucial, however, and what people on the street need to see is the effect it has in the real economy.  People need to see credit flowing back again.  It is not just about saving the banks but rather a matter of boosting the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Deputy Ó Snodaigh earlier mentioned the ESRI report and one can look at yesterday's Central Bank report on the economy.  There are signs in the economy that things are bottoming out.  Exports are performing very well in Ireland as compared to our European partners.  It looks as if the new rates of unemployment have fallen dramatically.  It is incumbent on us as a Government and Members of the Dáil to ensure that people who have recently lost their jobs are looked after and that we provide opportunities for them to get back into the workforce as quickly as possible.  The way to do this is to have a viable functioning economy.  The lifeblood of any economy is a functioning viable banking system whether we like it or not, we have to deal with this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">In the Government's view NAMA is the only way forward.  Independent economic commentators, including the IMF and the European Central Bank have endorsed these proposals, and at this stage they must be quickly implemented to ensure that within a short space of time those businesses that are being strangled by the banks can access the funds they require to keep employing people and to trade in the real economy.  That is what this about, not about banks or bankers <i>per se.</i>  I ask the Opposition to look at the Government’s record in this regard.  Take the bank guarantee scheme, which, Fine Gael in fairness supported.  This has brought in about €1 billion to the Exchequer.  It is not a free lunch for the banks.  The recapitalisation, as well, came with an 8% coupon and preference shares in AIB and Bank of Ireland to the tune of about €560 million.  Already with the uplift in the share values the Exchequer is better off by more than €2 billion.  It is not a question of giving anyone a free lunch in this regard.  We are dealing with the situation decisively.  I ask people to look at the issue in the cold light of day.  Since the credit crunch happened, not just in Ireland but across the world, every other country is dealing with a variation of the problems we have at present.  The Government has acted decisively and it has been proven in regard to the bank guarantee scheme and the recapitalisation that, effectively, our proposals and policies were correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">This is about real people, not banks.  It is about the 1.9 million people who are at work in this country and about those who have lost their jobs and ensuring that we give them hope.  The clearest point is that we will come through this recession and move on from it.  Lessons need to be learned, particularly with regard to the regulator and the Central Bank, and the type of lending that took place previously.  These are the issues with which we must grapple.</p>

        <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Deputy Máire Hoctor</from>
          <p eId="para_318">Táim an-bhuíoch don Chathaoirleach as ucht deis a thabhairt dom labhairt os comhair an Tí inniu faoin mBille stairiúil seo.  I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to address the House.  This Bill has been raised by my constituents with such frequency in the past few weeks that it demonstrates their serious concern at the content of the legislation.  I am certain we could not have anticipated 18 months ago the plans laid forth in this Bill, the global banking system having suffered its most serious upheaval in nearly a century.  We in Ireland have been uniquely affected by the economic meltdown and we require unique measures to revive the economy here.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Like all the Deputies in the House, I have over the past number of months received many letters, e-mails and phone calls about NAMA.  Many of the people who communicated with me were angry with the bankers and developers, and at the seemingly unchecked speculation and gambling, whereas, as they see it, the State has been left to foot the bill to clean up the mess which the private sector cannot or will not undertake itself.  I fully understand and appreciate this anger.  It is important for my constituents to know that I have heard their justifiable fury over the recklessness which has lead us to this juncture, particularly as a Fianna Fáil Deputy who supports the establishment of NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Unfortunately, indignation over the causes of the banking crisis, and with regard to where the responsibility firmly lies, does not amount to a policy to restore the banking system.  In the simplest terms, the Minister's proposal is to create an agency with the commercial aim of realising and recovering loans on a mixture of lands and properties over an extended period of time.  The aim is simply to free the banks of these loans so that they may release credit into the economy to enable commercial credit to flow once again.  Over the next nine to ten months, NAMA will individually examine each of the loans it takes from the banks — performing and toxic; house and apartment; and for zoned, commercial and development land both in Ireland, the UK and beyond.  The function of NAMA is to manage these loans and in time afford the properties the best exposure and secure the best price for the taxpayer.  After all, this is all about the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">This plan is not without risk.  The amount of real equity share in some of the properties taken to be managed by NAMA and the projected rise in property prices over the next eight to ten years will be critical factors as the agency proceeds with its work.  Nevertheless, because the agency proposes to take on performing and toxic loans on different varieties of development, commercial and residential property, the result will be a diverse property portfolio in which some properties and assets will realise more quickly than others.  This should ensure that the Exchequer breaks even over the lifetime of NAMA and that the taxpayer does not carry the burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The past three months have seen positive news coming from France, Germany and the United States and, though it would be premature to say that the recession in those countries has passed, it has been cautiously predicted that a return to growth will occur in the second half of 2010.  When recovery begins in the US and the eurozone, Ireland must be in a position to participate in business and to hit the ground running, and a functioning banking system will be an essential component of our economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The banking system may have further hurdles to overcome and there is the possibility of further recapitalisations as well as bank mergers or takeovers, which may occur over the next year.  Be that as it may, we cannot continue with ineffective banks.  The reluctance to lend is strangling small enterprises and farmers everywhere.  Individuals and businesses which have for decades enjoyed good standing in our high street commercial banks cannot now secure the credit lines which are utterly essential to continuing business operations.  The NAMA proposal will fully address this while balancing the risk sharing element with a proportion of subordinated debt to offset any possible losses the agency may incur.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I take this opportunity to voice my concern at reports that farmers may be hit by the so-called windfall tax rate of 80% on land zoned and acquired under CPO.  As the House is aware, many farmers with lands adjacent to towns or along the routes of new major roads have had parts of their farms rezoned by local authorities for housing or bought by CPO for roadway development.  In both cases, this happens outside the control of the landowners themselves.  We need to draw a distinction in this legislation between the farmer who is selling his or her lands voluntarily for development and the farmer who has been informed that a council or the NRA is about to acquire a portion of his or her lands.  It seems manifestly unfair to treat the two situations as one and the same.  The proposed 80% windfall tax is extremely high and it makes it difficult if not impossible for farmers to realise the development value of lands which they may wish to sell for housing or for some other use.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Section 155 of the Bill allows the agency to compulsorily acquire property if it is deemed necessary but, essentially, this gives NAMA the power to acquire additional land by CPO where the purchase significantly increases the sale price of the land already held by the authority.  Take, for example, the farmer who has land in his or her possession which has access to a development site owned by NAMA.  That farmer then could be forced to sell this land to NAMA in order to maximise the value of the development site.  While we would expect that every effort should be made by NAMA to reach agreement with the farmer on a price, if this was not reached by agreement, NAMA could then proceed to issue a CPO to the farmer, who would be subject to an enormous bill not of his or her making.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The 80% capital gains tax proposed in the legislation would no doubt discourage the sale of land in rural Ireland, which may prove an obstacle for future development of farming by new and young farmers who wish to succeed in the long term.  This would also be the case for the town or city dweller who may have property in the pathway of, for example, the Luas, and who, through no choice of his or her own, may have to surrender his or her property for the common good overall, but who at the same time may be subject to that 80% tax, which I believe is unfair.  I urge the Minister to ensure that this heavy tax levy is drafted in legislation in such a way as to protect farmers, landowners or property owners who are subject to compulsory purchase orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">I welcome the appointment of Professor Patrick Honohan as the new Governor of the Central Bank.  I hope his appointment will help to restore trust in the banking system.  In the course of our debates in this House on the NAMA legislation, it is both timely and appropriate to revisit the issue of regulation, corporate responsibility and checks and balances in the financial system in general.  The National Asset Management Agency is being born out of necessity caused by and in the aftermath of the recklessness engendered by lax regulatory oversight and sheer irresponsibility.  I sincerely hope the new Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator will scrutinise more closely the dealings of our banks in future.  The people of Ireland are angered most by the practices and shortcuts that have made this legislation necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I compliment the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, his officials and the Attorney General on this legislation.  It can be of no surprise to them that these measures are being watched closely in Europe and on the wider international stage.  The reception of the National Asset Management Agency has been positive and the innovations to the general model well received.</p>

          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_331">Through NAMA, the Government on behalf of the taxpayer has accepted the responsibility to pick up the tab for the banks and the many developers who gambled on the property bubble and lost.  NAMA is just the latest reckless proposal from a Government with a track record of wasteful spending.  From PPARS to electronic voting and FÁS, which is currently under discussion in the House and in the PAC, not to mention ministerial expenses, the Government has treated the public purse with disdain.  A decade of reckless Government policies has weakened Ireland to the extent that the global economic crisis is being felt more severely here than almost anywhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">What makes NAMA different from what has gone before is not that it is reckless or potentially wasteful, it is the scale of taxpayers' money that the Government is willing to risk to bail out careless, greedy and reckless activities.  The NAMA scheme is a bailout that allows the Government overpay for the assets it purchases on behalf of the taxpayer.  It will pay €54 billion for loans worth an estimated €47 billion.  The taxpayer will overpay the banks by at least €7 billion and possibly much more.  As previous speakers indicated, property values are still falling and nobody knows when or where they will bottom out.  Many of the loans that will be taken over by NAMA involve half-built buildings and development land that has now been reduced to agricultural value.  Nobody knows where things stand yet the Government proposes to overpay for properties based on its estimate of the current market value.  There is no current market value for some of the properties involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">To put the matter in perspective, the €54 billion cost of NAMA amounts to a contribution of €12,273 from every man, woman and child in the country to help the banks and developers with their property gambling problems.  The sum of €54 billion could pay for 208 Croke Parks, 72 port tunnels or 11 metros.  In the 36 years since Ireland joined the EEC in 1973 it has received €61 billion in transfer payments from Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The scale of the sums of money involved in the NAMA scheme has helped confuse almost everyone but the system itself is pretty straightforward when explained in everyday terms.  Let us imagine it in terms of purchasing a house where an agent has been employed by a purchaser.  The agent has identified a house which at the height of the property boom was valued at €770,000.  In today's falling market the best estimate is that it is worth €470,000 and probably less.  The agent offer the owners €540,000 for the house, substantially above the current market value.  The agent made this offer for two reasons; he or she knows the current owners are in financial difficulty and want to help them out and, he or she believes that house prices will increase in the future.  The results of the transaction are that the owners of the house cannot believe their luck and jump at the opportunity to sell the house for an amount well above what it is worth.  The purchaser gets a house which is worth far less than what they have paid for it.  The agent has put the interests of the owners ahead of his or her client.  In the case of NAMA the ripped-off purchaser is the Irish taxpayer.  The delighted owners are the bankers and developers who gambled on the property market and lost but are now being bailed out.  The untrustworthy agents are the Ministers who have put the interests of bankers and developers ahead of their employers, the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The Government's NAMA proposal has the potential to financially cripple the country.  It unfairly asks the taxpayer to take responsibility for the reckless actions of others.  NAMA is not guaranteed to get credit flowing.   By the Government's own admission NAMA will over-pay the banks by €7 billion.  The vast majority of the loans to be taken on by NAMA are for land or development projects whose values may have fallen by well in excess of the Minister for Finance's estimates.  In some cases land was bought at hugely inflated prices because it had development potential but now it only has potential as agricultural land.  In those cases such land could be worth only 10% or 20% of the NAMA loan value.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Most of the loans, perhaps more than 60% of them, which NAMA will own are non-performing loans.  In the current climate it is impossible to see how the developers who owe that money will be able to repay it.  What the Government does about those loans and developers will become an issue almost immediately.  For the scheme to work the new agency must be more effective at recovering loans from the developers than the banks have been.  We will be dependent on a Fianna Fáil-led Government to ensure a State agency actively pursues people who just over a year ago were regular supporters of the Government.  In November 2008 an IMF report found that government-owned assets management companies were largely ineffective in resolving distressed assets, largely due to political and legal constraints.  Why are we expecting things in Ireland under this Government to be any different?</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The Government has failed to fully consider the impact of interest rate increases upon NAMA.  If over the next ten years the ECB rate, currently at 1%, averages the 3.8% expected by financial markets the average funding cost of NAMA will be 4.3%.  Such an increase would cost the taxpayer an extra €15 billion.  The Green Party promised that its Ministers would fight at the Cabinet table to ensure a fair system of risk sharing to protect the taxpayer.  We see from the Minister for Finance's proposals that the risk sharing element will be a mere 5% — a fig leaf figure to cover any Green blushes.  A 5% risk sharing element in NAMA is next to nothing, which is roughly about the amount of influence Green Ministers have at the Cabinet table.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The most important issue at this stage for the economy is that we get credit flowing.  Everyone across the House appears to be in agreement on that point.  Unemployment is at record levels.  Available credit is needed to protect existing jobs and create new ones.  The NAMA scheme is based on the Government's belief that the transfer of this vast amount of wealth from the taxpayer to the banks will encourage those banks to start lending again.  We have seen no guarantee that this will happen.  The banks are as likely to use this money to pay off their own liabilities to other banks and the international money market as they are to provide extra lending to help economic recovery.  Each bank's number one priority is not the recovery of the economy but its own survival.  Where the best interests of the Irish economy come into conflict with the best interests of the banks there will only ever be one winner under the NAMA scheme.  The €36 billion from NAMA that will be paid to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide will be of little benefit to the economy and may not result in even a single new loan being issued.  NAMA may provide banks with the funds to allow them to issue loans but it does nothing to guarantee they will issue new loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Yesterday, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard a presentation from the Electrical Manufacturers and Distributors Association of Ireland, EMDA, which is connected to the construction industry.  It outlined the difficulties its members are currently facing.  It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_340">On the purchasing side, the perception of Ireland is of great importance.  With our reputation suffering severely over the past 12 to 18 months, some European suppliers are no longer extending credit facilities to Irish importers and are demanding to be paid up-front, often despite decades of fruitful business relationships.  The diminishing Irish reputation, especially where it is connected to the building sector, also has a negative effect on the availability of credit insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">In one case a company had its credit insurance reduced from €1 million to €100,000.  That is one example of how small and medium business enterprises throughout the country are suffering.  We hear such stories frequently now.  Overdraft facilities are not available to businesses, credit facilities have been reduced and the cost of overdrafts has been increased.  There is no guarantee that NAMA will get credit flowing into the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">There is an alternative, namely Fine Gael's proposal for the establishment of a good bank — a national recovery bank — funded by the European Central Bank.  In October 2008 the French Government established a similar state guaranteed wholesale bank to provide funding to French businesses allowing them to protect existing jobs and create new jobs.  That approach has many advantages as it would get credit flowing immediately, inject new lending into the economy without delay, and help to stimulate job creation.  Instead of buying toxic development loans at a highly uncertain value it would focus on high quality loans directly linked to new jobs and economic recovery.  Such a bank could be open for business in a matter of weeks.  It would be less of a risk for the taxpayer.  An investment of €2 billion would leverage €20 billion of new lending funded by the ECB.  That would ensure a functioning banking system that would deliver credit to struggling businesses and households.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Despite what the Government would like everyone to believe NAMA is not the only option.  It is a high risk gamble with taxpayers' money, a bailout for those bankers and developers who were reckless and greedy.  Despite promises, there is no guarantee of credit flowing to the economy, which is desperately needed if we are to begin the long road to recovery.  The Government's proposal offers no guarantee that this will happen.</p>

          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_344">The collapse of our banking system can partly be attributed to a regulator who was asleep on the job and poor regulation in the banking sector.  Both the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator failed to monitor the actions of the banks over many years because of the cosy and close relationship that developed between them.  From the country's point of view it is important that a full investigation takes place to find out how and why this happened.  We must ensure our banks are adequately regulated in future to prevent something like this happening again.  In that regard I am a little surprised that in the Government's legislative programme under section C, the heads of a Bill relating to changing the regulation of banks have not even been agreed.  That Bill must be fast-tracked immediately to ensure the current situation does not happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are seeking to establish NAMA to solve the banking crisis and to get credit flowing again in the economy.  However, there is no guarantee.  Our party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, asked the Taoiseach today if he could give a guarantee that credit would flow again under the NAMA proposal but the Taoiseach, yet again, did not answer the question.  NAMA is a costly exercise and that is the main reason Fine Gael totally opposes proceeding with it.  It is a €54 billion gamble.  It is taking out a mortgage that is guaranteed by taxpayers' money to buy toxic developers' loans from banks.  A premium of €7 billion is being paid over the market value.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The total values that have been given are very dubious.  It is hard to see how the figures being bandied about are credible, particularly when the property market is continuing to fall.  We know from the Daft.ie website, for example, that property values nationwide have fallen by 4.6% over the last quarter of July, August and September.  This has definitely not been factored into the figures that have been presented to us.  The figures are not credible.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">NAMA is a massive gamble for numerous reasons.  In a falling market it is not possible to put a realistic value on development land and property.  It is ludicrous to purchase development loans in a falling market.  It is a gamble too far, and involves the taxpayer taking 95% of the risk while the banks only take 5% of the risk through the subordinated bonds.  That is clearly inequitable and must be changed immediately.  The public is not in favour of NAMA.  This arose on the doorsteps when we canvassed on the Lisbon treaty.  One got it in the neck that people are totally opposed to it. <i>The Irish Times</i>/MRBI poll of 5 September showed that only one in four people supported the Government’s NAMA proposal.  We have also been bombarded with correspondence from ordinary members of the public who are really concerned about the major risk being taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Under the legislation, if NAMA makes a loss there is no provision for a levy to be applied to the banking sector.  The banks will again get off the hook if this is not included in the legislation.  No cash flow analysis was provided by the Minister for Finance in his presentation on NAMA.  That creates little confidence that the Government has done its homework on this issue.  We must see what the cash flows will be over NAMA's proposed life span of ten years, although I expect it will last a good deal longer.  The rate of interest quoted by the Minister was 1.5%.  He did not clarify that it is a variable rate of interest.  Interest rates will increase in the long term so it will clearly cost taxpayers a great deal more.  This is a major oversight.  We must have the facts and see the projected cash flows and how the Government envisages NAMA working.  Taxpayers need that.  There must be some form of accountability to taxpayers.  They need to know what will happen in the future.  Falling rents are also not factored into the dubious figures we have been given.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">As Deputy Clune pointed out, Fine Gael has an alternative proposal, which is to set up a national recovery bank.  This would guarantee that money would get to businesses immediately and get them functioning properly again.  It would only take between four and six weeks to get the recovery bank up and running.  This would leave the banks responsible for undertaking the reckless lending to take the risk.  They would have to fix up their balance sheets rather than have the taxpayer bail them out.  We would give the banks until the end of the guarantee period in September 2010 to repair their balance sheets.  If they failed to do that, we would separate the banks into a good bank and bad banks.  The private investors who took the risk and invested in the banks would take the hit rather than the taxpayer.  In fact, the taxpayer would have very little exposure.  The State would have to put €2 billion up front and would seek between €30 billion and €40 billion from the European Central Bank.  This makes it a very credible proposal if it were pursued.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Many businesses have gone to the wall as a result of being cash starved.  Fine Gael's proposal would create a small number of jobs, which are badly needed in the current climate.  There is a huge information deficit in the public domain about how NAMA will operate for the next ten years.  It will distort property prices.  The taxpayer will buy property not just here but in other countries.  Many people have major concerns about that.  That situation must be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Regarding the secrecy, there is no transparency with this proposal.  We are concerned that the Freedom of Information Act will not apply fully to NAMA.  It should apply so there is full transparency.  There can be no cover-up with NAMA, and no sweetheart deals with property developers.  In the fullness of time, the information about the deals that will be struck by NAMA must be publicly known so people can have a certain level of confidence that this proposal works correctly.  The proposal to remove 25 directors from the banks does not go far enough, particularly if the new regulation of the banking system is not put in place immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">An agency similar to NAMA was adopted in France in the 1990s.  It failed spectacularly, with the loss of €15 billion of French taxpayers' money.  The French Government decided to do a U-turn and set up a recovery bank.  We can learn from other countries' failings.  It is not too late for this Government to do a U-turn and adopt the proposal to set up a national recovery bank.  In advance of the Oireachtas committee meeting on 31 August, Deputy Richard Bruton set out Fine Gael's position and what core corrections and principles must be adopted for NAMA to be successful.  Unfortunately, the Government did not listen to him.  The risk sharing element should be split 50:50 between the banks and the taxpayers, rather than the taxpayers taking 95% of the risk.  That is wrong.  There must also be guidelines from NAMA as to how it will deal with developers who are in default on their loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The legislation does not mention homeowners or the protection of homeowners at risk of repossession.  A total of 100,000 homeowners are in negative equity and the ESRI stated yesterday that 35% of these are at risk of being unable to meet their mortgage repayments next year.  Conveniently, this is not being discussed.  We must look at how other countries deal with the repossession crisis.  There must be a social dividend.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">We on this side of the House totally oppose the NAMA proposal.  On 31 August, Deputy Bruton set out the core principles the National Asset Management Agency must adopt to help improve the situation.  I have no doubt the Fine Gael Party will table many amendments to the legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy Seán Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_355">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009.  Introducing the legislation, the Minister for Finance indicated that the National Asset Management Agency will purchase a loan book valued at approximately €77 billion for approximately €54 billion.  The figure of €77 billion is broken down as follows: Allied Irish Banks, €24 billion; Anglo Irish Bank, €28 billion; Bank of Ireland, €16 billion; the Educational Building Society, €1 billion; and Irish Nationwide Building Society, €8 billion.  The Minister noted that it is projected that 36% of the assets will be land, 28% development property and 36% associated commercial loans.  Many of the commercial loans were for normal lending purposes and not confined to property.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The Minister also noted that it is estimated that 40% of the loans NAMA will acquire are cash flow producing.  As such, repayments are being made on these loans and the cash flow produced will be sufficient to cover interest payments on NAMA bonds and operating costs.  I raise this because many people believe NAMA will only acquire bad loans.  The agency will acquire all property loans, both good and bad, above a certain level.  It will do so for the good reason that many developers have a mixture of good and bad loans and the highly complicated nature of many loan structures would make it impossible to separate paying and non-paying loans.  Acquiring all loans has the advantage of keeping the property portfolio together, while producing a positive cash flow for the National Asset Management Agency from the outset.  It is important to note that all activities in the banks' property portfolios are covered by NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The geographical breakdown of the loans to be acquired by the National Asset Management Agency is as follows — approximately two thirds are in the Republic of Ireland; one fifth is in Great Britain; 6% are in Northern Ireland; and most of the remainder are in the United States and other parts of Europe.  As each of the loans must be valued individually in accordance with the valuation methodology, the estimate of the price to be paid for the assets is provisional.  It is anticipated that NAMA will pay approximately €54 billion for the loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Those who argue the banks are getting off scot free may have been confused by the sums involved in the debate about the National Asset Management Agency.  A child in second class could work out that if NAMA is expected to pay €54 billion for loans with a book value of €77 billion, the banks must write down €23 billion from their loan book.  Before the process even commences, the banks are required to remove €23 billion from their balance sheets.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The suggestion that NAMA will acquire loans at their original book value is daft.  I will be generous and assume that people have not understood that the banks will be forced to accept losses of €23 billion in their balance sheets.  This write-down requirement could cause significant difficulties for the banks and may result in further problems.  The banks are taking the biggest loss up-front, as will be clear from their audited accounts when they are published next year which will show that loans initially valued at €77 billion with a valuation of at most €54 billion.  The first hit will be in the balance sheets of the banks involved in the NAMA process.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">A further misapprehension is that the State will borrow €54 billion with no return.  We will get assets and property with an underlying value of €47 billion.  The maximum exposure, therefore, is €7 billion.  In addition, a bank levy may be introduced later in the process if a shortfall arises.  It is important that people realise that the maximum value of the hit the Government, through NAMA, will take is €7 billion.  If it does not recover this amount, a levy will be imposed on the banks which are already taking a €23 billion write-down before the process even commences.  This basic point has been missed by most people.  This oversight is fair enough given the complexity of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I welcome the Bill, in particular, the decision by the Minister in July to seek public comment on an early draft.  A number of amendments were made before publication and the legislation remains essentially a work in progress.  While many amendments and improvements must be made to the Bill, its basic premise is a good one.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Anyone who argues the NAMA process does not carry a risk is fooling himself.  At the same time, one takes a risk when one gets out of bed or crosses the road.  Life is not risk-free and it would be foolish to pretend there is not a risk attached to the NAMA proposal.  We should measure the risk by being aware that doing nothing would be much more harmful to the economy.  The Labour Party proposal for blanket nationalisation is daft.  The Irish people do not want nationalisation, which must be a last resort.  We have taken shares and options in the banks and have been forced to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.  Immediate nationalisation of AIB and Bank of Ireland when such a measure may not be necessary would be irresponsible.  However, depending on economic circumstances, the Government may have to increase its share in these banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I will not even discuss the Fine Gael Party proposal for a magic bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">In introducing the legislation, the Minister pointed out that we must address the health and stability of the banking system to ensure the credit required by the economy is provided.  As it stands, the legislation is deficient in this regard.  I hope detailed provisions will be included before the Bill completes its passage through the Oireachtas to ensure credit becomes available.  The Bill deals with the stability of the banking system by removing the banks' property loans and arranging for them to receive a major cash injection.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I disagree with many of my colleagues in that I regard the establishment of NAMA as a bailout for the banking system.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">It is not, however, a bailout for builders or developers, all of whom must repay their loans.  Why are we bailing out the banking system?  Without functioning banks, people cannot receive their wages or social welfare payments, buy bread, milk or butter or pay their mortgages or mobile phone bills.  Without access to cash, people cannot live.  Access to a banking system in a modern economy is equivalent to access to electricity.  A banking system is a basic infrastructure required in an economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The barter economy was replaced centuries ago.  People need cash in their pockets to meet their weekly requirements and send their children to school.  Without access to a functioning banking system we would be in a dreadful situation.  It would be almost akin to not having electricity.  Those who believe one can operate without a banking system are living in cuckoo land.  As is the case with banking, we would have to intervene if something happened to the electricity system.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_374">I am concerned that the €23 billion hit to the banks' balance sheets may cause severe financial difficulties and perhaps solvency problems for some of them.  As has been stated throughout this process, the banks may require additional funds.  Further capitalisation may be required either through the taxpayer or the banks' own resources, whether as a result of reorganisation or the disposal of non-core activities.  I am concerned to ensure that any agreement signed between the Government or National Asset Management Agency and the banks will require that a large proportion of any such additional funds be made available for lending in the domestic market.  It is no use for the banks to get that money, put it in their balance sheets, steady their own situations and bide their time for a year or two until the economy improves and not lend it out in the meantime.  I would also be worried when they get this large cash injection, because any institution anywhere in the world that has a large cash deposit will be a takeover target for international banks and institutions.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">It is important that money is lent out to Irish businesses and not left sitting as a temptation for foreign companies to come in and take over some Irish banks after the Irish taxpayer has put funds into them.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">One issue which was raised outside this House — this is my first opportunity to mention it here — is the role of the Minister outlined in section 122, which refers to the powers assigned to the Minister under this Bill and which would be more properly carried out by a judge in the Commercial Court or the High Court.  We have all seen the excellent activities of judges in the High Court, the Commercial Court and the Supreme Court who implement legislation strictly which was passed by these Houses on companies who have been trying ducks and drakes with the financial system in Ireland.  They have been getting answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The people of Ireland would have far more confidence in the final arbiter of valuation of any asset in the event of a dispute between individual banks and NAMA.  I and the people would be much happier, and the Minister would be better off, if he was not directly involved in any role in the process because there would always be an allegation of political involvement in it.  The best way to ensure that does not happen is to make provision in the Bill that in the event of a dispute, the case goes to the Four Courts to people who have more experience in dealing with complicated property transactions than anybody in the Department of Finance, who would be called upon to advise the Minister for Finance on this issue, could possibly have.  It would increase public transparency and would remove the suggestion that has been made in many quarters of a close relationship between politicians, the banks and the construction industry.  It would be good for everybody concerned if we could do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The Minister will be responsible to this House for NAMA and will, ultimately, be the largest shareholder in the individual banks.  It would be a conflict of interest for any Minister or Government to be involved in the valuation process when they have responsibility for NAMA and the banks.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_381">Did the Deputy tell him that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Deputy Seán Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_382">I have told him and I hope the point will be taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Many years ago we set up tribunals and a decade later they are still ongoing.  We are setting up NAMA and I am sure in decades to come it will still be in place.  Ministers of Finance will deal with NAMA through its lifetime and during the next decade or so.  Inevitably the current Minister will not be in place during the entire period and there will be changes in personnel over the decades.  It is clear from this House that Ministers who are hostile to the NAMA Bill and the banks will be dealing with them at a future date and it would be wrong at that stage that a Minister who is hostile to the process was in any way involved in dealing with the valuation process.  It would be better to take this Minister and all future Ministers out of this role.  It would remove them from the process and would be a far more independent and transparent way of doing it.  People would agree with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Another matter I ask the Minister to consider in the Bill is the statement that NAMA shall not be regulated by the Central Bank.  That should be changed.  Too many senior people in recent years were paid out of the public purse while they were asleep at the wheel when they were meant to be dealing with financial matters and regulation.  We must ensure this does not happen with NAMA.  Most companies which are regulated by the financial regulator take in deposits and pay out loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">A typical hire purchase company is not currently regulated by the regulator — that might not be well known — because all it does is take in wholesale loans and give out loans for cars, televisions or whatever, but when it does not take deposits from the public it is not regulated by the Financial Regulator.  It was set up initially to protect people who put deposits in banks.  The regulator does not deal with any institutions which do not take deposits.  NAMA will not be taking deposits rather, it will be taking over loans from the banks and the Bill specifically excludes this from financial regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I ask for that matter to be reconsidered because excluding any organisation dealing with €70 billion of bank loans and underlying assets from regulation is not the way forward and it would be important, in the public interest, that there be some independent financial regulation.  Loans worth €77 billion are too much responsibility to give to one chief executive or a board of directors with four, five, six, nine or ten members.  Apart from debates in this House it is also important that the public is happy to know there is an independent Financial Regulator.  I am not referring to the type of regulation we had in the past, but proper regulation which needs to happen in the future and which we have not been accustomed to in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">I agree with proposal of the Minister that every single director of every bank that was <i>in situ</i> on 30 September last year when they got the State guarantee on their deposits must go.  Not one can be left in place.  It is not personal; I do not know who they are but——</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_389">It will happen as part of the regulations in this Bill, as far as I understand.  The people of Ireland have a slightly jaundiced view of the banks.  People should remember that a long time ago the Insurance Corporation of Ireland debacle resulted in the Government bailing out AIB.  There was no change at the top of the bank so it carried on in its merry way and we then found a few years later, as a result of a great enquiry undertaken in the Oireachtas by the Committee of Public Accounts chaired by the late Jim Mitchell, that the banks were the main organisers and participants in the largest tax dodging scheme in the history of the State through the deposit interest retention tax scheme and offshore accounts.   The major banks in Ireland had to pay back more than £100 million in unpaid tax that they had facilitated.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">After that, the mistake the Government at the time made — I forget who was in Government but it applies even if some of my colleagues were in Government — was that it did not make changes to the boards at the top levels of the banks.  If we do not do it now we are telling the banks they should carry on their merry way and in another ten or 15 years' time they can do the same thing again.  We have to force a cultural change in the bank and the best way of doing that is for every single director to go, otherwise we are saying everything is okay, something we cannot do.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I ask NAMA to dispose of the good loans which are being repaid.  If they are coming in at full value and there are no problems, it should not be a problem for NAMA to off-load them as quickly as possible internationally to other financial institutions who will take over their management.  That will produce a massive cash injection for NAMA early on in its proceedings.  It will reduce the exposure for the taxpayer.  The public of Ireland will see that some of these loans are producing real cash up front.  We have no business setting up a State agency whose sole function will be to collect debts on good loans while another institution could be doing it on an international basis, once it pays NAMA for the value of doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">It goes without saying that there must be strong provisions in the legislation to prevent people from dealing with property that comes under NAMA who have defaulted on previous loans.  If somebody has a business which goes bust he or she is free to start again, but those whose assets have gone into NAMA, who have defaulted on NAMA, have gone through the courts, are found to have defaulted and ultimately do not pay their debts to NAMA, which will be the Irish taxpayer, should not be allowed to buy assets from NAMA two, three, four or five years on at a knock-down price.  They will have done the taxpayer once and should not get the opportunity to do it a second time.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">For a period of ten years NAMA should have to give its consent for the future and onward sale of any of its properties to ensure they never go to anybody who is a current defaulter of NAMA.  The local councils have such a system in place, where if one buys a council house, one is supposed to get permission from the local authority before selling it on again.  It is normal procedure for the original owner of the property to have the right to give consent and it would be very important to have such a measure in place.  The Revenue Commissioners are very concerned about phoenix companies, that is, people who change companies and set up a new one.  They stated they did not have sufficient powers to deal with the issue and the situation needs to be examined to make sure NAMA does not become the victim of phoenix directors.</p>

            <p eId="para_395">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, is the main Government-funded service that assists people who are overly indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  It is important for people coping with debt difficulties to take early action and approach MABS for help and guidance.  This can be the first positive step for people as they address their debt difficulties.   The role of money advisers is to help people to assess their financial situation, make budget plans and deal with creditors.  MABS is dealing with increasingly complex debt situations in the cases of clients who are presenting with multiple creditors and debts.  The 53 independent MABS companies, which have voluntary boards of management, operate local MABS services in 65 locations throughout the country.  The MABS national telephone helpline is available from Monday to Friday between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.  The MABS website can be accessed 24 hours a day.  In 2008, more than 16,600 new clients approached MABS for assistance with debt difficulties and the telephone helpline dealt with almost 11,000 callers.</p>
            <p eId="para_396">In the first nine months of this year, 14,700 new clients were seen by MABS staff and the helpline received more than 18,000 calls.  Funding of almost €18 million has been provided to MABS to deliver its services in 2009.   An additional 19 staff are being recruited for MABS, which will bring the money advice staff to more than 270 in 65 locations.  This will help local services to manage their increased caseloads.  The capacity of the locall telephone helpline has been strengthened.  The national support company, MABS NDL, has introduced a number of community education initiatives.  One initiative involves a money management education programme, which informs people facing redundancy about managing on a reduced income and avoiding getting into debt.  All MABS companies operate an appointment system for meeting clients.  Clients with urgent difficulties are prioritised for attention and dealt with promptly.  Less urgent cases are referred to the telephone helpline and the MABS website.</p>
            <p eId="para_397">More than 90% of callers to the helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline adviser.  Some 10% of callers are referred to the local MABS for assistance.  Other areas of debt are dealt with by community welfare officers, through the rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement schemes, with which we will deal later.  MABS is the main State body that deals with people experiencing indebtedness.  I am satisfied that it provides a high quality personal service.</p>

            <p eId="para_398">Just five of the 19 additional staff are full-time.  How many additional full-time positions are there in the Money Advice and Budgeting Service?  How many full-time positions do those 19 people hold?  While it may be difficult, it is better to act before people get themselves into difficulties.  Does the Minister have any plans to be more proactive in trying to assist people before they get into debt?  I ask that question because 80% of Irish mortgage holders are on variable or tracker mortgages.  It is expected that the European Central Bank will increase interest rates next year, or sometime after that.  The number of people unable to pay their mortgages will increase at that point.  We need to try to resolve that situation and assist those people at this point, rather than waiting for them to get into difficulties down the road.  Does the Minister have any plans to regulate commercial debt advisers?  She will have seen reports over recent weeks about companies that have been set up in this sector.  It seems that people saw a vacuum in the market and moved in.  Like MABS, I have many concerns about the lack of regulation of this sector.  People are having to make significant down-payments to some of these companies.  I am aware of cases in which the first month's payment went to the company, rather than being used to pay a utility bill or some other bill.  I have concerns about such practices.  It would be better to regulate this area now so that we do not have to address greater problems in a year's time.</p>

            <p eId="para_399">I understand that 12 full-time posts have been divided up among 19 full-time and part-time workers, although I stand to be corrected.  The Deputy suggested that people should be given advice in advance, which can be done in several ways.  I recently launched a programme under the Money Advice and Budgeting Service's community education programme, which is very successful at giving information to people at a young age.  MABS, in conjunction with the Financial Regulator, has devised a useful document in support of the transition year programme on money management and priorities within money.  The MABS programme for working with Travellers will help such people from running into debt.  The Deputy specifically asked about mortgages.  I understand from the Financial Regulator that when one is selling a financial product, such as a pension or a mortgage, one has to advise people that its value is likely to decrease as well as increase.  People have to be given that information.</p>

            <p eId="para_401">I do not question the Deputy's opinions on what has happened.  She is right to mention that people were advised to take out 100% mortgages, for example.  The Financial Regulator obliges financial institutions to give certain advice.  There has been an increase in the number of debt collection groups, many of which have written to me to offer assistance with our work.  I am aware of a serious and unfortunate case in which a number of people received letters, purporting to come from MABS, claiming they could receive support and help.  It was frightening and disconcerting for people.  Any organisation engaged in financial business is required to adhere to certain guidelines.  I will investigate whether the Department of Finance or the Financial Regulator needs to do anything else to regulate the companies mentioned by Deputy Enright.</p>

            <p eId="para_402">I urge the Minister to do that immediately.  People will encounter difficulties down the line.  It is wrong that people's payments for an entire month are going to these companies, rather than towards the repayment of the debts that got them into trouble in the first place.  The huge waiting lists for MABS — of up to three months in some areas — are causing people to get into bigger difficulties.  Is the Minister satisfied that the 12 full-time posts are sufficient?  Can she comment on the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the number of cases being dealt with by MABS personnel each week?  The report seems to contradict my experience, which is based on my conversations with the staff of MABS.  I respect the work done by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report, which is generally fairly correct.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on these matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_403">There are two issues.  At a time when there is an embargo on recruitment, we were lucky to secure 12 positions.  We have divided them among the MABS offices with the greatest increase in demand.  I was also a little taken aback by the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the number of cases being dealt with by MABS.  I have witnessed the work that is being done.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did not take account of the huge increase in the number of people who are dealt with on the telephone.  Some 18,000 people, the vast majority of whom had straightforward issues that could be dealt with over the telephone, have called MABS so far this year.  More complex cases need to be dealt with differently.  The staff of MABS on the ground are genuinely trying to prioritise those with the greatest need.  If someone is in a particularly difficult situation with priority loans, rather than secondary loans or debts, he or she will be dealt with immediately.  MABS also has ongoing money management clients from year to year.  I have suggested that there may be a way of putting such people at arm's length, perhaps by meeting them fortnightly rather than weekly, to ensure that the new catchment of people who are coming in can be dealt with.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_225" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_405">The Government is aware that wider and longer term pensions issues require a comprehensive and co-ordinated response.  Following the conclusion of the successful consultation process last year, we have been considering options to address the challenges facing our pensions system which were raised in the Green Paper process.  These issues relate to social welfare pensions, the sustainability of our pension system generally, the adequacy of current provision and other complex issues around regulation, public sector pensions and retirement age.</p>
            <p eId="para_406">In the past year, the economic environment has changed considerably and we need to ensure that decisions we make in the pensions area are robust enough to withstand new and unprecedented challenges.  The recently published McCarthy report and the report of the commission on taxation both considered pensions issues, albeit from a different perspective.  In bringing forward its proposals for pensions provision in the future, the Government will have regard to the issues raised in these reports as well as the options proposed in the Green Paper and the follow-up consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_407">In the meantime, we have been responding to the immediate difficulties facing employees, particularly those in defined benefit schemes whose companies and pension schemes faced difficult situations as a result of collapse in equity values and the economic situation.  The Government has moved quickly to protect people's entitlements through the measures announced last December and the amendments passed in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009.  These measures include the establishment of a pensions insolvency payment scheme, a reordering of wind-up priorities, provision for restructuring of pension benefits and stronger regulation with regard to remittance of pension contributions.</p>
            <p eId="para_408">It is entirely appropriate that the Government should take the time to arrive at sound decisions about the future of our pension system given the potential of such decisions to significantly impact on this and future generations.  Our objective is a system which will deliver an adequate retirement income for all which is at the same time affordable and sustainable for the State and those who sponsor and provide pension schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_409">It is reasonable to say that time is needed to prepare a policy on pensions but we are approaching the second anniversary of the publication of the Green Paper on pensions.  Since the beginning of this year, Deputy Enright and I have sought to know when the framework will be produced.  During the early months of the year, the Minister repeatedly assured us it would be a matter of weeks but these assurances seemed to die a death.  She is quoting from other reports and documents but what is she doing about the matter?  She is responsible for pension policy and has had two years in which to draw up a White Paper on pensions.  In the meantime, thousands of people are finding their pension provisions are completely inadequate and there is no initiative from the Government.  The steps to which she referred are merely scratching the surface.  I ask her to tell us the reason for the delay in bringing forward the long-promised pensions framework and the month in which we can expect it to be published.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_410">When I indicated at the beginning of the year that we hoped to publish within weeks, that was the situation which then obtained.  However, it would be foolish of us to issue a long-term framework or strategy while ignoring the changes that have taken place in the economy since the publication of the Green Paper.  The economic basis for any framework has changed completely in the past two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_411">As I noted in my earlier reply, we addressed some of the immediate issues of significance.  Equally, any changes recommended in the framework will be of a long-term nature.  They will not impact on those who are about to reach retirement age.  It is not correct to suggest that people who have now lost their pension rights will be affected by these recommendations.  It is important that we set out a long-term framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_412">I do not want to mislead the House by stating that the framework will issue in the next few weeks but it remains a priority for us during this term.</p>

            <p eId="para_413">In June the Government produced a document which proposed a pension insolvency minimum guarantee scheme.  When will we see that scheme?</p>
            <p eId="para_414">The former workers of SR Technics and Waterford Crystal are crying out for assistance from the Department of Social and Family Affairs in dealing with the serious pensions issues they are facing.  The Minister referred to two schemes, neither of which have been commenced.  In the case of Waterford Crystal, it appears no help is available at present.  When will she move to provide much needed assistance to the former workers of SR Technics and Waterford Crystal?</p>

            <p eId="para_415">The Department of Finance is responsible for drawing up regulations under the pension insolvency payment scheme.  Officials from that Department have been working on the scheme over the summer because technical issues have arisen.  However, they continue to make progress on it.  The fact that regulations are not in place has not impacted on the funds because it is not as if they have not been wound up.  The fund managers know the scheme is coming and the funds will be included in the scheme if they qualify.  That is the nub of the issue for one of the companies mentioned by the Deputy.  The double control provided for in the scheme requires that the company be insolvent and the pension scheme be in deficit.  My understanding is that Waterford Crystal meets these requirements but, unfortunately, the SR Technics company does not qualify because it is not insolvent.</p>

            <p eId="para_417">It was never stated that SR Technics would be included in this scheme.  I met representatives of the group and they made good arguments but according to the definition of insolvency in legislation introduced by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the company does not qualify.  I sympathise with the workers because, as far as they are concerned, the company no longer exists.  However, under legal terms and definitions it does not qualify for this scheme.</p>

         asked the

         if she is satisfied that social welfare payments are being processed within an acceptable timeframe; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_419">Processing times vary across schemes, having regard not only to the volume of applications but also to the requirements of each scheme.  For example, a means assessment must be carried out for all social assistance schemes, medical examinations are required for illness related schemes and customers must satisfy the habitual residence conditions.  In the case of the insurance based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.</p>
            <p eId="para_420">In general, average processing times for most schemes administered by the Department are within acceptable levels.  For example, in the case of illness benefit, approximately 50,000 medical certificates are received each week and the average processing time is one week; 95% of maternity benefit claims are processed prior to the commencement of maternity leave; the average processing time for domestic state pension contributory claims is seven weeks; and the average processing time for child benefit is four weeks where the entire family resides in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_421">The average processing times nationally for jobseekers payments in September were under four weeks for jobseeker's benefit and under eight weeks for jobseeker's allowance.  I appreciate that waiting times for the jobseekers payments are too long in some parts of the country and I assure the House that we are doing our best to address this with additional staff and improved procedures for processing claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_422">Other schemes where steps are being taken to reduce processing times include the disability allowance and the invalidity pension.  Receipt of the disability allowance is subject to a medical assessment, a means test and a habitual residency test.  It can take time for each of these criteria to be met.  The number of claims has also increased significantly from approximately 17,600 applications in 2006 to 21,000 in 2008.  Entitlement to invalidity pension is based on satisfying medical and insurable contribution conditions.  However, approximately 90% of applicants for invalidity pension are already in receipt of illness benefit from the Department while awaiting the result of their invalidity applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_423">Overall, I appreciate the need to ensure that people can receive financial support from the Department as early as possible and I assure the House that we are doing our best to bring processing times in all schemes down to an acceptable level.  In the meantime, it is important to remember that people who have urgent income support needs can apply for the means tested supplementary welfare allowance and greater than 95% of basic such applications are decided on and paid within the week.</p>

          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_233">
            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_424">I am not satisfied that applications are being processed within an acceptable timeframe.  The Minister provided examples of payments which are made on time but I will outline cases where delays have occurred.  The biggest issue with which we deal is the jobseekers allowance but I also wish to raise the back-to-education allowance.  I do not know Deputy Shortall's experience of this issue but I am aware of a significant number of people who have returned to college on the basis of loans from credit unions or family members because their back-to-education allowance claims have not been processed.  What are the timeframes for the back to education allowance and, importantly, what can the Minister do to ensure that people are not borrowing on the expectation that they will get something they may well not get?</p>
            <p eId="para_425">On the lone parent allowance application, I know of someone who is waiting for a lone parent allowance application to be approved; I actually received an e-mail about it at 2.38 p.m.  The person is waiting for the lone parent allowance application to be approved before the person's back-to-education allowance can even be considered.  It is necessary to verify that the person is entitled to the first one before ascertaining if the person is entitled to the second one.  That person has gone back to college with a very young child and does not know if the back to education allowance will be granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_426">The other question I want to ask relates to the jobseeker's allowance.  My party has raised this matter numerous times in this House, but I will give the Minister an example which happens to be in my constituency; in Edenderry the waiting time is 22 weeks.  The Minister seemed horrified when she learned that on 11 September last, but I raised the matter in this House at least three times this year.  In fact, the first time I raised it the waiting time was 16 weeks and the Minister was going to do something about it then.  Whatever was done added another six weeks to the waiting time for the people in Edenderry.  I wonder how the Minister will address such situations.</p>

            <p eId="para_432">Sorry, I do have it.  Yes, it is 13 weeks for the lone parent allowance application.  However, as the Deputy will be aware, there are issues in that regard.  It is not merely the case that one must have a child; a person must also be living alone and the income must be assessed.  It is the income that takes time to assess.</p>
            <p eId="para_433">Some 11,710 applications for back to education allowance have already been approved.  This is a valuable increase of 67% this year.  There are still approximately 4,000 cases awaiting a decision, a number of which may have come in only recently when people have made late decisions.  The Department is working its way through that.

One of them related to setting up an appointments system.

        <b>Deputy Róisín Shortall</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         if she will respond to the criticisms in the Comptroller and Auditor General’s annual report that significant amounts of money are likely to have been paid out by her Department in excess of entitlement in recent years. 
        [34914/09]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_262" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_459">The prevention of fraud and errors in payments is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Through initial means testing of applicants, reviews of existing claims and targeted control activity in high risk schemes, we aim to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time.</p>
            <p eId="para_460">Where people have been paid more than their entitlement, we seek to recover as much money as possible and have a policy of prosecuting those who have committed serious fraud.</p>
            <p eId="para_461">On the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, while the Department of course shares his concern about ensuring that people only get what they are entitled to, we disagree with the methodology underpinning some of the analysis in the report.  In particular, we believe that it is not appropriate to suggest that past overpayments should be in line with figures from the fraud and error surveys or that there would be such a similarity between figures for future savings and those for past overpayments.</p>
            <p eId="para_462">When fraud or error is found in an individual claim, future savings will arise from the person having his or her payment reduced or stopped.  However, it may not be possible for the Department to calculate or collect the value of any past overpayments to the individual concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_463">Often the effective date of a revised decision will be a current date, rather than a retrospective one, in which case no overpayment legally arises.  For example, all medical reviews resulting in termination are made from a current date.</p>
            <p eId="para_464">In other cases, the ability of the deciding officer to establish when exactly the claimant's entitlement ceased will depend on the circumstances of the individual claim.  For example, if a person who has been claiming a jobseeker's payment is found, on review, to have been working and the Department can ascertain the period of that employment, then it should be possible to calculate the value of the overpayment involved.  However, if a lone parent is caught cohabiting, the person's payment may be stopped, which would result in future savings, but it is difficult to ascertain when the cohabitation started and thereby compute the value of any past overpayment.  Similarly, when a payment is terminated because the claimant has moved address and therefore failed to respond to letters sent to him or her, the deciding officer will not have the evidence to make a retrospective decision resulting in a recorded overpayment.</p>
            <p eId="para_465">The Comptroller and Auditor General's analysis should be read with this caveat in mind.  None the less, I assure the Deputy that both preventing and recovering overpayments is a major priority for the Department and that we are determined to ensure that every euro of taxpayers' money is spent appropriately.  To that end, we are not only doing our best to prevent payment errors at the initial application stage, but also targeting high risk schemes for frequent control activity.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_263">
            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_466">The bottom line is that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is a most respected office, has found that significant amounts of money have been overpaid by the Department and a small proportion of that has been detected.  By any standards, that is a fairly poor performance by the Department.  For example, in one of the schemes that has the highest fraud and overpayment rate, the one parent family payment, surveys suggest that in 2007, €67 million was overpaid yet the Department detected only €5 million of that.  That cannot be a good performance.  There is a concern that the Minister is not targeting those schemes most prone to fraud.  Would the Minister agree, given the vast amounts of money involved and given the pressures on the Department's budget, that it makes sense to bring a much sharper focus to the area of overpayment and fraud, and for that reason to have far more frequent fraud and error surveys in which she would target those schemes most prone to fraud because she does not seem to be taking that approach?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_264" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_467">In fact, the Department is now working on the basis of not only fraud and error surveys but, as a result of those, of identifying the high-risk categories, and at the time of application even noting which are the ones that need to be constantly reviewed.  For example, the Department is aware that within child benefit there are certain sectors that must be followed up frequently.  In the case of the lone parent allowance, cohabitation is a problem but problems also arise where those lone parents are working — this is where they are more likely to exceed the qualification criteria for the particular scheme.  Equally, with some areas of disability there are some who will undoubtedly be permanently on the payment and there are others who need to be constantly reviewed.  The Department does do that, and has become expert at identifying high-risk groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_468">The Deputy mentioned in particular the example of the lone parent.  It is worth reiterating that if overpayments have been made to a cohabiting parent, and the parent says the cohabitation only started last week, there is no evidence that would show that it has in fact been going on for two or three years and allow the Department to claim overpayment for that period.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General has said that is where we should be able to make savings.  If a pensioner dies, in contrast, the Department can check exactly when that happened — we have a system of cross-references now anyway — and know when the overpayment started, so it can claim the money back.  Thus, there is variation among the different schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_469">If any amount of money is given incorrectly, every effort should be made to try to retrieve it for the State.  However, it was established that overpayments amounted to an equivalent of 0.32% of the total social welfare expenditure.  This must be viewed in the context of the number of payments being made every week, which is 1.25 million.  I accept it is important to identify high-risk groups, and that is what we do.  It is important to conduct regular reviews on as many recipients as possible and retrieve money that has been overpaid.</p>

            <p eId="para_470">We can all quote figures.  The Comptroller and Auditor General found that of the five schemes surveyed, overpayments were recorded in a quarter of cases.  That is a high number.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">The Minister diverted staff away from fraud and into processing, which was perhaps justified on a short-term basis.  Is there now a full complement of staff dealing with fraud?  Does the Minister accept the conclusion of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the Department was far overstating the amount of savings in terms of money actually retrieved?</p>

            <p eId="para_472">The Comptroller and Auditor General is using a fraud and error survey to determine that overpayments were made, although the survey was done to identify the high-risk groups in order to make savings in the future.  I am not saying no overpayments were made; of course they were, and we always try to get them back.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General was using a survey that was designed for a completely different purpose to extrapolate figures.  It is not true that he said overpayments were made in a quarter of cases.  That only referred to a particular table in the report, which does not show the proportion of overpayments in all welfare claims reviewed.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         the amount of money saved in her Department through fraud prevention measures to date in 2009; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [34865/09]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_269" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_476">The amount of money recorded as control savings by the Department by the end of August 2009 was €312 million, which represented an increase of €5.5 million on the same period last year.  It should be noted the Department only records as control savings moneys which are saved as a result of reviews of existing claims.  However, particular focus is currently being placed on prevention of fraud and error at the claim application stage.  This is the most cost-effective mechanism of reducing losses through fraud and error in social welfare schemes, but savings achieved in this way are not included in the published figures for control savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_477">The Department has introduced a number of new measures to target control activity at high risk categories of claimants.  For example, the special investigation unit is undertaking more regular interviews of high-risk recipients of jobseeker's payments, and those in the Border regions have put an increased emphasis on control of claims from applicants with a previous address in Northern Ireland.  In addition, the option to receive payments by electronic fund transfer has been removed for new claimants for jobseeker's payments, who must now attend in person at the post office each week, thus confirming their continued residency in the country.  Their claim is automatically suspended where two consecutive payments are not collected.</p>
            <p eId="para_478">One-parent family payment recipients with earnings are being targeted for ongoing review, as this scheme has been identified as high risk in the Department's fraud and error surveys.  We have also stepped up measures to prevent people fraudulently claiming child benefit while no longer living in Ireland.  To that end, the frequency of mail shots to validate continued entitlement to child benefit has been increased to three months for EU workers and resident non-Irish national customers.  New data matches with other public bodies have also been initiated to effectively target reviews and generate savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">Overall, the Department is moving to a risk-based system of claim review, which it is hoped will achieve better value for money by focusing scarce resources on the most appropriate cases.  A new control review policy for the disability allowance scheme was introduced in January 2009, which involves assigning and recording a risk rating at the award and review stage of all claims in the medical and means categories. A similar risk-based control review policy is being piloted for carer's allowance, with the same approach planned for invalidity pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_480">It is worth pointing out that the number of anonymous reports from members of the public has increased dramatically in the past year, with more than 4,600 reports made at the end of September 2009 compared to approximately 1,000 in 2008.  Each report is followed up.  I am determined to ensure that abuse of the social welfare system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.  In this regard, the control programme of the Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continually refined to ensure they remain effective.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_270">
            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_481">I am interested in the Minister's last point about anonymous reports because it was stated at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs — I do not know whether it was the Minister herself or an official who said it — that despite the large number of anonymous reports, when they are actually investigated the percentage that turn out to be correct is quite small.  I do not know why the Minister threw that in at the end of her reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_482">The Minister had a target of more than €600 million in savings in this area for this year.  Will she meet this by the end of the year, bearing in mind that savings were at €256 million up to the beginning of September?  How will she make up the difference?</p>
            <p eId="para_483">An example from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General was that of welfare officers in County Longford, where the number of checks on whether claimants were genuinely seeking work was reduced by three quarters in the middle of last year, and checks ceased altogether by December of last year.  That is an example of one office.</p>
            <p eId="para_484">I am amazed by stories of new claimants who have not previously been part of the social welfare system going into social welfare offices, in places where they are definitely not known, and not being asked for any form of identification.  Many people have said this to me.  They have a card but there is no photograph on the card.  What is the Minister's response to this?  There is a basic level at which every single member of staff who deals with the public can contribute to preventing fraud, rather than just the specialists.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_271" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_485">It was worth mentioning in my reply that people are making reports of possible fraud to the Department because it shows the value people are placing on money.  Even if many of those who are the subjects of such reports are not fraudulently claiming, the State saves money from the ones who are, so it is still valuable.  What people generally do not realise is that there can be quite a high disregard of earnings in some schemes; thus, a lone parent can earn up to €146 per week and still claim the full allowance, but the person complaining may not realise this.</p>
            <p eId="para_486">With regard to the target, we had achieved €312 million in savings through fraud prevention measures by the end of August.  It is difficult to say what our control savings will be by the end of the year, but the target is high, at €616.5 million.  To be honest, I cannot see us reaching that target.  The number of reviews has gone up, but the savings from those reviews have not been as great as expected.  We have saved more on child benefit, carer's allowance, family income supplement and illness benefit than we had expected, but we have not quite reached the target for unemployment benefits.  Perhaps people are not able to get work.  In addition, it has been indicated to me that people are now working from within their own homes.  One can be a professional person working on a computer while claiming benefits, but an inspector has no right to go into one's home and check, although he or she could go into a building site, for example.</p>
            <p eId="para_487">I am anxious to progress with the PPS card, about which I am currently in negotiation with the Department of Finance, because it would be a wise way to cut expenditure.  The new PPS card will have detail in it which is personal to the recipient.</p>

Many people are willing to pay them cash.  People resent that their incomes have been reduced, they have had to pay levies and so on and they want to obtain better value for money.  However, in paying cash to a tradesman or person providing a service, they are denying to the State the taxation in that regard, which money could be reinvested in the economy.</p>

        <b>Deputy Martin Ferris</b>
         asked the

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_499">Since May 2008, 357 extra staff have been assigned to local offices, new central support units and the Department's inspectorate.  Of these, some 200 have been assigned since January 2009 as follows: 16 social welfare inspectors were assigned in March 2009 to various locations around the country to undertake means testing and other work associated with processing claims for the jobseekers allowance — I gave a more up to date figure in this respect earlier; 68 posts have been assigned to date for local office central support units in six locations; some 116 posts have been assigned to local offices around the country, some of which have been filled by temporary staff pending the assignment of permanent staff.  The position will be kept under review and whatever additional resources are required will be allocated.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">A number of measures have also been taken to improve the processes used in processing claims.  These include the introduction of a streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years, an improved procedure for claimants moving from jobseeker's benefit to jobseeker's allowance, fast-tracking of certain categories of claims, on-line availability of application forms for the jobseeker schemes and new arrangements to include claims from casual employees to be processed in a more timely fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_501">One of the most significant initiatives introduced recently aimed at reducing queuing and waiting times involves the customer attending the office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided.  This system has already been introduced in 20 offices and the Department is finalising plans to extend the initiative to a further 20 offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_502">I assure the House that every effort is being made to ensure that claims are processed as quickly as possible.  However, anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on their claim for a jobseeker's payment can apply for supplementary welfare allowance.</p>

            <p eId="para_503">I wonder if the Minister knows how well the new system of appointment is working.  I have heard that some of the appointments are running over resulting in people having to wait a lot longer than expected.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">Of the 357 extra staff, how many took up contract positions which were not being renewed?  Has an additional 357 staff been appointed or were 357 permanent staff put into this area?  Also, how many vacancies exist in the Department that need to be filled to ensure social welfare offices are fully operational and able to cope with the enormous queues at social welfare offices every morning, of the type we experienced in the 1980s?</p>

            <p eId="para_505">If the current appointment system is not working local managers need only increase the time for appointments from 30 to 40 minutes.  It is a local matter.  It is far more preferable to tell a person who attends in respect of a claim to call back on a specific date at a specific time to a particular hatch rather than simply tell him or her to join the queue.  As I understand it, the system is working well.  Any regional difficulties that arise can be addressed at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_506">Temporary staff will be removed as soon as permanent staff are appointed.  The Deputy will be aware there is an embargo on recruitment to the Civil Service and as such the new staff are being redeployed from other offices.  The numbers I gave are significant in terms of the ones already in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">There are no vacancies within the Department.  It is simply a matter of staff redeployment.</p>

It is almost Christmas again and there is still no social welfare office in Balbriggan.  The Minister promised me this matter would be addressed.

            <p eId="para_516">Performance in respect of tackling the waiting lists has been unsatisfactory in recent months.  A particular problem appeared to have arisen during the month of August when waiting times increased by, on average, 16%.  In places like Roscommon and Tullow the waiting time increased by seven weeks during the month of August alone.  In Clondalkin the waiting time increased by four weeks.  The key problem appears to be the lack of adequate cover for staff during holiday time.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">It is completely unacceptable that people who applied for the jobseeker's allowance this month or even last month will not receive their payment before Christmas.  By any standard, that is completely unacceptable.  Performance in this area has been very poor.  What arrangements has the Minister made to ensure adequate cover when staff are on holiday or on sick leave, as can be expected given that winter is approaching?</p>

            <p eId="para_524">The reality of the situation is that files are left sitting on the desks when staff are absent from work due to illness, maternity leave or annual leave.  I am being told when I contact the social welfare office that particular matters are not being dealt with as the person dealing with them is out of the office.  The Minister needs to tackle this issue.  It is not in one or two places, it is across the board and that is the Minister's responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">The Minister said the new appointment system is in place in 20 offices and will be set up in 20 more.  If it is working so well, why not put in place everywhere?</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_526">The main reason is to ensure the management and staff of the particular office are in a position to be able to take it and that the accommodation in that office can facilitate the number of hatches for appointments.  It is a straightforward process and will be rolled out.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">Some claims, such as benefit claims, are very straightforward which is why they can be done in a week in some places.  The system can be checked and if the contributions have been made the person qualifies.  People must be trained, however, to make decisions on assistance because so many documents must be considered and so many interests must be taken into account.  It is not quite as easy as saying someone can have immediate cover.  I do not want to see delays but huge inroads have been made into the backlog.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_529">The special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes was established by the Minister for Finance to examine current expenditure programmes in each Department and to make recommendations for reducing public service numbers to facilitate a return to sustainable public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_530">At the special group's request, my Department submitted an evaluation report on the various schemes and services operated by the Department as well as expenditure trends, to facilitate the group's examination of my Department's expenditure.  The evaluation report described the Department's work, identified some key policy issues and provided a range of options for changes in schemes and services to assist the special group in its deliberations.</p>
            <p eId="para_531">Those options were not advanced as the proposals of the Department but as items which might be technically feasible within the parameters of given schemes or across schemes.  Some of the options identified are mutually exclusive.  Others interact with each other, often in a complex way.  The cumulative impact of proposals on various categories of social welfare recipients also have to be taken into account.  Finally, some options, as indicated by my Department, might need to be reconciled with wider Government policies, such as policies to promote employment, education or training.</p>
            <p eId="para_532">The document prepared by the Department has been made available to individuals who sought its release under the Freedom of Information Act, including the Fine Gael leader's office.  It has also been published on the website of the Department of Finance and can be accessed at <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_533">As per the FOI guidelines, certain material has been withheld from publication as it concerns matters relating to the deliberative process which were not put forward as proposals by the special group.  The deliberative process is ongoing for the upcoming budget and the Estimates process.  In this context, and giving due regard to the public interest, it was considered to be inappropriate to publish certain elements of the document prepared by the Department at this stage.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LucindaCreighton" eId="spk_301">
            <from>Deputy Lucinda Creighton</from>
            <p eId="para_534">I am stunned by the material that was released under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.  I accept that this is a series of options as opposed to recommendations but the people and those who represent them on the Opposition benches should be entitled to see the options.  Going through the report, there are pages and pages of blacked-out measures.  That is not transparent governance.</p>
            <p eId="para_535">People are entitled to some appreciation of the thinking of the Department.  We face one of the most crucial budgets in the history of the State and the Minister and her Department are withholding important information that ought to be put in the public domain so different elements of civil society and those affected can look at the options available.</p>
            <p eId="para_536">This has fed into the findings of the McCarthy report and the Government has been completely irresponsible in forcing Mr. McCarthy to defend his own report.  The only Cabinet Minister with the gumption to defend any of the recommendations in the report is the Minister for Finance.  Every other Minister has failed to stand up and be counted.  There is a proposal for savings of €1.8 billion in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and no one on the Opposition benches is any the wiser as to where those savings will come from.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_537">Decisions have not been made on several of these issues and will not be made until the budget so it is important we be allowed to take time in the deliberative process.  The Freedom of Information Act facilitates that, specifically allowing for exclusion of information where a decision has not yet been made.  Every decision related to social welfare is linked to the budget so those decisions have not been made yet.  There are other areas of the report that were excluded because they would disclose positions to be taken in Government negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_538">We are not trying to keep information from people, we are trying to allow a reasoned debate on the issues.  The public knows the issues, everyone knows the schemes and the numbers benefiting from them.  No decisions have been made on any issue and the documents provided to the McCarthy group are the very documents the Government will use to make its decisions in the next few weeks.</p>

            <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
            <p eId="para_539">The McCarthy report has been described as a red pen exercise.  It is easy to go through budgets and slash left, right and centre with no regard for the implications of the cuts.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">One proposal was the discontinuation of the €30 million funding for the Family Support Agency.  I am keen to know the Minister's thinking on this area given her background as Minister with responsibility for children.  Presumably the Minister accepts the need for early intervention in family difficulties and the need to provide family support services.  What is the Minister's thinking about such services now?  It is easy to say we could save €30 million but has there been any estimate of the likely savings in justice, social welfare, education and other areas through the provision of early intervention services from the Family Support Agency?  It is a "no-brainer" as far as I can see.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_541">It would be possible for me to ask but not to answer regarding all of the proposals in the McCarthy report because decisions have not been taken on any of them.  In all of our considerations I have made it clear that we examine how a scheme or payment impacts on other schemes and not just in my Department.  I want to ensure any decision made in social welfare that relates to children is examined in terms of its impact on the same family through changes in education or health.  It is only when the budget is being worked out and we make our recommendations that we will see the impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">The way the Family Support Agency was addressed in the McCarthy report was misleading.  It gave the impression that by abolishing an agency there would be a €30 million saving.  When the figures are broken down, much of the funding goes to the Family Support Agency while another large amount goes to counselling grants.  It is not quite the same as a €30 million saving from abolishing an agency.  It almost gives the impression it is entirely concerned with administration and that does a disservice to the work of the Family Support Agency.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_543">The Minister claims that blacking out passages allows for debate, something I do not understand.  One section in the report received by Deputy Kenny's office covers carer's allowance, carer's benefit and respite care grant.  Every single possible option is considered and 12 paragraphs are blacked out.  How does that enable debate?  How do we know what is being considered for carers?  There is a great deal of concern about these proposals among carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">Are the Minister's considerations for the budget solely based on the McCarthy report and the Commission on Taxation or is the Minister also considering other changes or reductions that are not in those reports?</p>

            <p eId="para_545">The only instruction that we have at the moment is to reduce the social welfare budget.  It has not been predetermined as to how that is going to be done.  When I say that it leads to a debate, I mean that it allows discussion at Government level and in here to take place, in the knowledge of what people are getting, how many of them are getting it, and so on.  The fact that a 5% or 3% cut is recommended in the McCarthy report has resulted in a panic being created throughout the country.  There are 600 groups that receive grants from the Family Support Agency, and they are all writing in to me in a panic.</p>

            <p eId="para_551">The mortgage interest supplement scheme provides support for people who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayments and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The scheme provides a short-term income safety net within the overall social welfare system, to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment.  A supplement in respect of mortgage interest only may be paid to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  There are currently over 14,100 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 75%, or 6,000, over the number in payment at the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_552">The assessment for the mortgage interest supplement scheme provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Those availing of part-time employment and-or training opportunities can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_553">The review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is progressing.  The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence.  The review group includes representatives from this Department, the community welfare service, the Department of Finance, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Office of the Financial Regulator.  The group is examining trends in programme and administrative costs, the impact of the Financial Regulator's statutory code of practice on mortgage arrears on the mortgage interest scheme, and legislative and operational issues that arise, including the cap on hours of employment.  The review is also considering whether alternative approaches to achieving the scheme's objectives are warranted in the light of recent changes in the economic climate and the mortgage market.  The full review should be complete in early 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_554">Following consultation with the community welfare service, guidelines on specific and immediate operational issues for the community welfare officers operating the scheme were updated recently.  The guidelines are available on the Department's website, <i>www.welfare.ie.</i>http://www.welfare.ie/</p>

            <p eId="para_555">Will the Minister change the eligibility criteria as part of the review?  If one person in a household is working more than 30 hours, he or she will not get mortgage interest supplement, regardless of how much money the household is bringing in.  Does the Minister intend to make any changes to that?  People are being penalised and being refused mortgage interest supplement on the basis that they should never have taken the loan out in the first place.  That is placing full liability on the household who took out the loan, regardless of the fact that the banks should not have given them the loan in the first place, if it is to be considered as reckless lending.  There is no responsibility being put on the banks for providing such a reckless loan, yet the person will suffer the repossession of their house because they are being refused mortgage interest supplement on that basis.  Does the Minister intend to consider this and ensure it is fair?</p>
            <p eId="para_556">There seems to be a difference in how the criteria have been interpreted around the country for mortgage interest supplement.  Will that be changed?</p>

            <p eId="para_557">One of the criteria is to look at the time the person took out the mortgage, and whether he or she had an ability to repay it.  That is reasonably valid, because the question could be asked as to whether he or she will be able to repay it.  It must be asked if the State should continue to pay the mortgage interest for somebody who this time next year might never be able to attain that level of repayment.</p>

            <p eId="para_559">It is difficult, but it is a legitimate question.  One of the other questions is to ask whether the person is in a house that is greater than his or her needs.  In other words, are there other ways in which he or she can get an income?  Can a room be let out or can the house be shared?  That is a valid question when supplementary welfare is being provided to somebody.</p>

One man with a large house ran into difficulty, and it was suggested to him that the house was bigger than his needs.

            <p eId="para_565">This situation is urgent.  There are hundreds of people in negative equity and facing the prospect of losing their homes.  The Minister promised reform by last Easter, but we have not yet seen it.  As well as the areas that have already been identified by Deputy Enright that urgently need reform, such as the 30 hour rule and the means test, does the Minister accept that the Government needs to look at putting in place a much more creative scheme to enable people to stay in their own homes when they have financial difficulties?  Is she prepared to look at a scheme where the State might take an equity share in people's homes if they can no longer afford to make the repayments?  Does she accept that the priority must be to enable people to stay in their own homes as far as possible?  If so, what steps is she taking to make that happen?</p>

            <p eId="para_566">It is a priority that people need to be supported to remain in their own homes.  Mortgage interest supplement is only one way of doing that.  The mortgage interest supplement will only apply to a relatively small number of people who find themselves in difficulty in repaying their mortgages.  People might find themselves in that difficulty by virtue of lower incomes or having lost their job, or whatever.  Therefore, it must be tackled in a number of different ways.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">The mortgage interest supplement is meeting the needs of over 14,000 people today.  There is evidence that perhaps 10% of those who apply do not qualify for it.  That is the information we are getting back from CWOs.  It is not as high as might have been indicated in different reports earlier this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_571">There is a number of people who are in negative equity, but that does not mean that they are not able to repay the mortgage.  They are still repaying a mortgage which relates to the loan that they took out but unfortunately, the value of the house has declined and that would impact on them if they sold it.  Where real support can be given to mortgage holders is with regard to the capitalisation of the banks, and with the agreements and protocols that have been made with them so that they will not move on people, but negotiate with them instead.  There has also been a new housing Bill, with a new incremental house purchase scheme for people, which allows them to find a new, innovative way of buying houses.  That has been initiated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_580">I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 155 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">The back to education allowance, BTEA, is designed to facilitate people of working age on welfare payments to return to education to gain qualifications which will help to enhance their employment prospects.  Jobseekers who avail of the scheme are exempt from the requirement to be available for work while participating in an approved course and, in addition, an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.  Participants may continue to receive any secondary benefits to which they have been entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">Improvements to the scheme were announced in the supplementary budget which came into effect on 1 May 2009.  To qualify for participation, an applicant must now be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for three months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  The qualifying period for access to third level courses is reduced to nine months for those participating in the national employment action plan process or engaging with the Department's facilitator programme.  People awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  In general, an applicant must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, lone parents and recipients of jobseekers' payments who are out of formal education for at least two years can qualify at 18 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_583">A total of 11,710 applications have already been approved in social welfare offices this year.  This is an increase of more than 2,420 on the number of applications processed this time last year.  I have made a table available of the number of applications processed at each local office.  Because these claims are not recorded as a separate scheme until the person transfers from their primary payment to the relevant second and third level options under the back to education scheme, statistics are not readily available as to the number of claims awaiting a decision.  However, indications are that there may be up to 4,000 applications still to be decided.  A significant number of these are awaiting additional documents or information from the applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_584">Due to the nature of the scheme the majority of applications are made in August and September in advance of the commencement of the new academic year.  Overtime is made available to the local offices to prioritise these claims and ensure that all applications are processed as quickly as possible and in time for the commencement of the academic year.  However, quite a number of people delay sending in their applications and in those cases it is not possible to guarantee that a decision will be given before commencement of the relevant course.  All possible steps are being taken to ensure that applications are dealt with as speedily as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_715">I appreciate the table was not circulated in the House.  What is the minimum, maximum or average time it takes to process these claims?  A figure of 4,000 outstanding still in October seems a significant number.  I appreciate that if people did not apply on time, they cannot be processed on time.  However, what about those who did?  From the people I know, I am sure a significant number of that 4,000 applied on time.  The situation is a bit like dealing with the third level grant and will be an annual problem.  Has the Minister any plans to front-load staff in the future to deal with the issue?  The facilitators I have dealt with have been excellent in helping people, but there is a problem in that people are borrowing to attend third level in the expectation of receiving the allowance.  If they do not get it now, we will see them drop out of the system.</p>

The table will be of assistance to Deputies in seeing the number of applicants from each different area.  There has been an increase in the numbers this year because we have promoted the initiative significantly, the facilitators have been very positive and there has been a significant increase in the number of places available.  There are some 146,700 extra places available in the further education sector, which demonstrates the level of activity.  If some people do not qualify for the back to education allowance for full-time courses, there are thousands of new part-time evening courses available for people in receipt of social welfare benefits.

          <p eId="para_725">I cannot support the Government's NAMA approach to resolving the banking crisis.  It is very unfair to taxpayers and the public, who should not have to take responsibility for the reckless behaviour of developers, banks and even the Government.  Unfortunately, for many reasons NAMA is not the solution to the banking crisis.  First, NAMA remains a secretive tax-funded politically directed work-out process for 1,500 of the most powerful, well-connected politically directed people in the country.  Also, NAMA will provide an unnecessary bailout of banks by capping their losses.  More importantly, it does not provide any mechanism to get credit flowing again.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">NAMA has not received any domestic endorsement.  The Small Firms Association says it does not believe the Government's NAMA plan will be enough to get credit flowing to small businesses around Ireland.  It also feels that unless we get credit flowing to businesses, jobs will be at risk.</p>

          <p eId="para_729">Where did this all start?  It started in the Galway tent where builders and developers were cheered on to create a bubble in which most people got caught up.  This bubble was encouraged and supported by the Government, property developers, bankers and speculators.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">Many young couples are in negative equity because they bought their houses at the height of the boom, but they have now been badly caught.  I come from a business background and a business that ten years ago employed up to 30 people.  Businesses had to diversify, but we did not survive.  I diversified into property and bought shares.  I bought shares in the two major banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland at the height of the market.  I also bought shares in Eircom and in many mining companies.  Sometimes I made a profit, but I did not make a profit on my bank shares.  I am like most people in this country who when they make a profit do not expect to hand it over to the Government, but just pay the capital gains tax.  However, I find it repulsive to think that the people who speculated and gambled now depend on the Government and banks owned by taxpayers to bail them out.  This is wrong.  People should be able to pay their way and should do so.  Those who have lost should not be able to cop out or be bailed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">Billions of taxpayers' money will now be paid into NAMA to bail out the banks. One of NAMA's chief goals is to get money flowing to businesses again.  However, I believe the terms of reference are being weighed in favour of the banks and the big builders, while neglecting the needs of the small and medium enterprises and the ordinary person on the street.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Given my background, I want to address one aspect of the legislation.  Small businesses are the lifeblood of this economy and employ hundreds of thousands of people.  However, hundreds of businesses are gone already with the loss of a great many jobs and hundreds more are on the verge of bankruptcy.  I tried to raise the NAMA terms of reference for two consecutive days in the Dáil and in the end I was put out of the Chamber for trying to highlight a situation which I believe to be very serious.  If we want the economy to get going again it starts with jobs and it ends with jobs.  The Government and the banks are in denial as regards what is happening to businesses in this country.  Clearly the Government is far more interested in bailing out the golden circle of bankers and big builders, instead of helping the thousands of hard working businesspeople and their employees who keep the economy going.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">The Government is deluding itself that banks have started to lend to businesses again.  It should wake up.  The banks have probably the most professional PR companies in the country.  The three banks have colluded to give the impression that they are open for business and lending again.  They are not open for business.  Just ask any of the businesses that are trying to employ people around this country, farmers, etc.  The banks are closed for business and lying through their teeth.  Any Administration that believes what the banks are saying should be put out of government, because I believe we have a crisis and this Government is in denial.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">We are fed up with the small empty promises from the banks.  People are also fed up with the Government because it is not listening to small businesses.  Once again I would urge businesses and their hard-pressed families to remind the banks of the guidelines that have been set down as regards the next time they ask for a loan, overdraft or extended credit facility.  The banks should be reminded that they are only open for business, courtesy of the support of the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">I needed €20,000 to keep five jobs going, but I was told to close my business.  Why should I close the business and put five people who were employed full time on the dole?  This is happening around the country and I am not afraid to speak about it.  However, some business employers are petrified and terrified lest they offend the banks.  Because I went public, nationally, on this very situation, I was threatened by the banks.  I was told by one bank that it was monitoring everything I said.  I will not be cowed by a faceless institution that we have bailed out.  I believe the Government, for once, instead of being led by the nose in accepting that the banks are open for business, should question whether this is the case.  It will find they are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The current climate limits the number of customers who will be able to fulfil the terms of sensible lending criteria.  In the past we had Foir Teoranta to lend to businesses, and that helped us out many years ago.  We need a bank now to help out small businesses.  Once again, there are no guarantees that money will be used to provide loans.  Unfortunately, the money to be put into banks will just repair their balance sheets.  In the boom period they became too dependent on wholesale funding, rather than relying on the deposits of Irish customers to fund lending.  The money that will appear in those balance sheets may well be used by the banks to wean themselves off a reliance on overseas funding.  Foreign liabilities could be repaid using the NAMA proceeds which would mean more stable and conservative balances at the banks, but no increase in lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The only significant lending by Anglo Irish Bank is to existing large developers and little change has been witnessed in the bank's management.  Anglo will, of course, be participating in NAMA.  It should be noted that among most of the staff in the major banks who caused these problems the champagne corks are being opened because they are delighted to have jobs for life.  They will be in no hurry to ensure that the banking crisis ends.  Finally, there should be an investigation into why cheques are being delayed.  It takes five full working days for a cheque to be cleared.  Back in the age of steam it took two working days.  Something has to be done to ensure that credit is available for businesses.  NAMA is not the way.  An open new bank would be the way to address the crisis.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_738">At the outset, I thank Deputy Feighan for sharing his time with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">When the Minister for Finance introduced the NAMA legislation in the House, he said the establishment of the agency showed the Government was prepared to take bold action to deal with the banking system, which needed radical surgery.  Deputy Brian Lenihan further claimed that brave and decisive steps had to be taken immediately.  If ever there was a false declaration of intent by any Minister, surely that is, because we have no bold steps and no surgery whatever.  In other countries, bankers with reckless lending records were immediately removed, but there is no indication whatsoever that the Minister for Finance or the Government have any bottle to remove some, any or all of the banks' directors that have caused so many of the problems in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">If the Minister is not able to convince the public that NAMA does not represent a bailout for the greedy developers and foolish bankers who have brought the country to its knees, then he will have failed dramatically.  I have a few questions for the Minister to answer as regards this whole debate.  The first concerns the question of transparency.  In the supplementary budget document, paragraph 1.3, the question is asked as to whether there will be transparency in relation to loan transfers and NAMA.  The answer given was, "Yes — NAMA will operate on a commercial and independent basis."  That could, perhaps, be misinterpreted.  In light of this information as regards its exposure and its size, according to the document, NAMA is commercially sensitive so it would not be appropriate to disclose details.  How can the Minister for Finance convince the public that he is determined and that he will be transparent about what is happening if he has made this declaration?</p>
          <p eId="para_741">For the sake of the public and for the success of NAMA — if it is to succeed — it is imperative that the Minister for Finance is transparent in his actions and that the details relating to the major offenders involved should be open to the public at large.  A few months ago the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food mandated that all details of farmers who had drawn down public resources from the EU support grants should be available to the public.  If it can be done in the public interest in that instance, why can it not now be done in the case of NAMA?  Deputy Feighan indicated that we were talking about a secretive organisation.  So it will be if the Minister denies the public the opportunity to see the details as regards those who will be involved in NAMA, the people who have caused the crisis as regards banking services and otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">In relation to transparency, will the Minister mandate all Oireachtas Members who support the legislation, in either House, to declare their interests as regards whatever involvement they might have with NAMA?  If they are below the €5 million threshold, they might be dealt with in another way but, if they have an involvement with NAMA above that threshold, surely they cannot come to the House, join the lobbies and vote to support that without declaring their interest.  It would be a conflict of interest, as mentioned earlier.  If there is to be any credibility for NAMA, it is essential this happens as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">The €5 million threshold is one issue.  However, it is also important that the Minister would indicate the position with regard to all of the others who have difficulties with the banks.  In the past few days, we have had a finalisation with regard to ACC and the major developer controlling the Zoe group of companies.  However, many people, such as small developers, owe banks a lot of money although below the €5 million threshold.  If the banks go to the courts to chase down the loans, as I am sure they will, there will be a downside.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The Minister's prognosis that 1% growth for each of the next ten years will give a 10% return at the end of the cycle for NAMA will never materialise if the loans relating to a series of residential and commercial premises are called in by the banks.  People will be thrown out of their houses, and developers and investors in commercial premises will also lose their property.  All of this property will come onto the market and will undoubtedly depress it further, despite the Minister believing there will be growth and an increase in prices of 1% per annum.  While that seems moderate, there is no indication as to what will happen below the €5 million threshold.  I want to know what plans the Minister has in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">All of the NAMA plan was to restructure the banking system so that the banks would work again.  Deputy Feighan referred to his own very credible experience.  I want to give two examples of a simple situation where not a penny is being made available by the commercial banks, even to their best customers.  One example concerns a small business person who had a viable and progressive business.  He had achieved a contract from an Italian company to develop its products here in Ireland and he needed an increase in his overdraft.  When he went to his traditional banking source, he was refused point-blank for a loan of €25,000 to develop his business, which would create employment in that industry.  He has tried every other source that might support him but the answer was always "no".  It seems that inter-bank conniving is taking place with regard to the details, and if a person gets a black spot from one bank, that person is doomed in regard to all the banks.  That is unfair and it must stop.  One of the major planks of this process, the Minister declared, was that the banks would work and provide loans to support small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">My second example is as follows.  At the start of the fine weather some four weeks ago, the autumn harvest began.  A farmer who had 400 acres of cereals to harvest went to the bank for a loan to replace a machine which had been involved in an accident.  Bank staff said openly to him that they would allow his harvest to rot in the fields rather than give him €25,000 with which to buy a new machine to harvest his crop.  Not only did the banks refuse this man but all of the other leasing agents — every one of them — had the black spot ready and just ran him out of their offices.  They told him he was wasting his time and that he should go elsewhere, but he did not get an answer elsewhere either.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">When the Government introduced NAMA, it said there was no other show in town.  If that is the case and if the Government cannot see there is an alternative, and if 40 economists made a statement that this would not work but the Minister accepted as the be all and end all the advice of his recently acquired economic adviser, who was new to the political stage, we are in for a further crisis in the banking system.  The Government is paralysed in every sense of the word with regard to what it intends to do.  There has been no surgery.  Banks are sitting ducks for surgery but the Government did nothing.  With regard to decisive action to get the money flowing, Government members have sat on their hands and done nothing, and they have allowed banks to railroad the people into further misery.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_345">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_748">I wish to share my time with Deputy Niall Collins.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The legislation to establish the National Asset Management Agency is one of the most important Bills that has ever been debated in the Dáil.  The decision to set up NAMA was taken last April and the draft proposals were published in July last.  Never in the history of the State has one subject been so extensively and passionately debated both in the House and outside.  The Government is acting decisively because we simply cannot have economic recovery without a fully functioning banking system.  We are determined to re-fashion the financial and banking system, and to address and correct all regulatory and governance shortcomings, which the problems we have experienced in the past year or so have graphically illustrated.  NAMA will facilitate the speedy removal of high risk property-related assets from the banks books and enable banks to start lending to families and businesses again.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Much of the criticism of the legislation has concerned the price the Government will pay for the bad debts.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said he expects NAMA will purchase loans with a book value of approximately €77 billion for a 30% discount at a price of approximately €54 billion.  Each loan will be individually valued, meaning that in some cases NAMA will only pay the agricultural value of the land, while in other, more viable projects, it will pay the long-term economic value.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">We must remember that we need to get the economy back on track as quickly as possible.  We cannot do that by forcing a fire sale of assets at below what would be rational prices for them.  Despite what the Opposition would have us believe, the success of NAMA is not dependent on property prices going back up to 2007 bubble prices.  In fact, NAMA will have to achieve less than a 10% uplift over current market values on its assets over ten years to break even.  Another allegation being made is that NAMA is a bailout or rescue for builders or developers.  The Minister has confirmed that developers who are insolvent will be liquidated and NAMA will have the full range of remedies already available to the banking system, including repossession, enforcement of mortgages, the appointment of a receiver and the liquidation of companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Members of the Opposition have tried to argue that NAMA poses too big a threat to the taxpayer.  The biggest risk of all would be to do nothing while the economy continues to stagnate.</p>

          <p eId="para_754">The legislation provides that the banks will share a portion of the risk associated with NAMA.  This means that the banks will have an incentive to work with NAMA to achieve a profit for the taxpayer and they do not get to share in any profits.  However, if there is a loss, they will be subject to a levy.  The State may end up owning larger stakes in the banking system.  That is another form of protection which reduces the risk of taxpayers overpaying bank shareholders for the assets since taxpayers themselves are significant shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The Fine Gael approach is to let the banks struggle on for another year before a National Asset Management Agency is set up in September 2010.  Small businesses and families around the country cannot wait for another year.  We desperately need to get credit flowing now.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The Labour Party has called for full nationalisation.  That will not solve the problems in the banking system.  It will not make any of the problems faced by the banks go away.  The troubled loans will be still on the balance sheets of the banks, severely hindering their ability to support economic recovery through increased lending to businesses and households.  The nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, while necessary to protect the banking system, has not solved that bank's problems.  The reality is that full nationalisation would involve large up-front costs for the taxpayer.  The State would have to compensate the current shareholders of banks.  At current market prices, that could involve an immediate payment by the State of more than €5 billion in cash for the two major banks.  The State would have to borrow this money on international markets at a time when we are already borrowing €400 million a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Pre-emptive nationalisation of the entire banking system would pose an intolerable risk to taxpayers and result in a huge loss of confidence.  As mentioned earlier, bond market spreads for Government paper have improved considerably in recent months, which reflects a more positive view of our ability to deal with the economic crisis we face.  The loss of confidence would exacerbate funding problems for the banks as uncertainty about the banks' future would almost certainly scare away international depositors and bondholders.  Funding conditions are already difficult enough without risking full nationalisation.  Governments around the world have avoided wholesale nationalisation during the global crisis for those very reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">Our NAMA proposal has received the backing of the IMF and the ECB as well as former Fine Gael Party leader, Alan Dukes, and former Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald.</p>

          <p eId="para_760">It is also clear that the proposal has credibility in the financial markets.  On 30 August last the <i>Financial Times</i> reported, “Evidence that Ireland is addressing the crisis has been well received in financial markets.  Irish bank shares have rallied and the risk premium on Ireland’s sovereign debt has reduced.”  Since its announcement, the cost of borrowing by the State has already fallen.  It is now time to implement our plan and to get banks up and running and lending to Irish businesses and households.</p>

        <speech by="#NiallCollins" eId="spk_350">
          <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_761">I am grateful for the opportunity to partake in the debate.  It was opportune that the draft legislation was published as early as possible during the summer to allow us to have a national debate in the House and around the country in the manner in which it is taking place.  The longer the debate goes on the better and the more informed we will all become.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">One of the issues of concern is the level of misunderstanding about the intent of the proposed legislation and the Fine Gael proposal.  I was gripped with interest listening to the accounts of Deputy Ulick Burke's constituent, Deputy Feighan's own circumstances and the deplorable treatment they have suffered at the hands of the banks.  We are all familiar with such cases from our clinics.  Ultimately, the purpose of NAMA is to address such issues.  The longer it takes to devise a method to sort out the situation, the worse it will get.  It would be a dereliction of the Government's responsibility if we did not get NAMA or some other such vehicle up and running in order to address the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">We know all about the lack of credit that is available to small businesses but we must not forget about everybody else.  We hold a brief for everybody.  I refer to the farming community and to young married couples trying to access mortgages.  Value is available currently in the property sector but young couples are not able to secure mortgages.  Every sector of society is discommoded.  The problem with the banks is that they have impaired loans on their books and that is restricting their ability to raise credit on the international markets.  In its crudest sense, a bank is a shop.  In this case the shop buys money at a cost and sells it to the market at a margin.  Unfortunately, currently the bank does not have the ability to raise loans and, therefore, it does not have stock to sell.  We must act to improve the availability of funds and to increase liquidity.  The way forward is not to sit back and do nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">I wish to refer briefly to the bank guarantee scheme that has passed its first anniversary.  That was an important first step in addressing the banking crisis.  Many positive effects are evident as a result of that scheme, for example, the appointment of the public interest directors to the banks.  The Minister for Finance made a cross-party spread of appointees, which was important.  The fact that the individuals concerned were from various political backgrounds instilled a degree of confidence in the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">I welcome the placing of a cap on salaries payable to chief executive officers and senior bank executives.  Prior to the banking crisis there were front page newspaper reports of millions being spent by banking executives taking their trophy clients to the Ryder Cup in the United States at a cost of millions.  That type of activity must stop.  Every crisis presents an opportunity to address the anomalies that have built up in the system.  The Minister deserves great credit for addressing such issues head on.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">It was believed in some quarters that if we set the cap on those salaries too low we would not attract the right kind of people.  We have a wealth of people both in the country and abroad who would be keen to fill those positions in spite of the cap.  I do not know any of the bank directors who were in place at the time the bank guarantee scheme was introduced but it is time they moved on.  I do not know who they are but I do not hold any brief for them.  A cap should be also imposed on the term of appointment of any of the directors appointed in their place.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Legislation is due to be introduced to the House on the new FÁS board of directors.  It is envisaged that a cap of two terms will be placed on the new directors.  Those recommendations have been made for other State bodies in draft legislation due to come before this House.  Accordingly, it would be opportune and correct to place time limits on the duration of service a director can sit on the board of a bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">I sometimes wonder whether the public has a full understanding of the bank guarantee scheme.  Fundamentally, it is an insurance policy for every member of the public who holds a bank account.  If a bank fails, whatever money he or she has in a bank would be honoured.  In other words, when a person puts an ATM card into an ATM the money one seeks would be available to him or her.  That is the purpose of the scheme.  It was not to bail out developers.  It was to ensure that if a bank was threatened with collapse that the State would honour its liabilities.  That is as it should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">Fixing our banking system is imperative for our international credit rating.  We must have a functioning banking system in this country.  It was not an option to sit back, do nothing and allow our banks to collapse.  The notion being proffered by some people was that we should let Anglo Irish Bank go to the wall.  However, we must keep our international credit rating in mind.  Why is that important?  When our international credit rating was downgraded, the subject was brought up in this House.  People are very concerned about it.  We cannot let our banking system collapse and affect our international credit rating.  Consider the cost of funds.  With our current spending we are borrowing €400 million per week.  The cost of international funds will increase if our credit rating is downgraded.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">There are many upsides to the NAMA legislation, but there is a risk.  It is not a risk free operation.  We must address the issue and there is a downside.  However, there are many upsides, one of which is the opportunity to secure a social dividend.  All Members know areas in their constituencies and throughout the country where there is a deficit of infrastructure in terms of schools, hospitals or community health facilities and so forth.  Much of that is due to bad zoning.  Local authorities made wrong decisions by zoning areas for residential use when they should probably never have been zoned for such use.  If one looks at a map of the country, one can see the surplus of zoned land.  It could take up to 50 years to build on the zoned land in some parts of the country.  However, there are opportunities for the State to provide for the deficit of infrastructure in those areas.  NAMA can play an important role in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill has been published.  There is a proposal in that legislation to permit the extension of planning permission from five to ten years.  It is imperative that this legislation comes before this House as soon as possible.  It should be discussed in conjunction with the NAMA legislation because NAMA, in taking over these asset-backed loans, many of which will have planning permission attached to them which could be approaching the five year expiry date, will need that permission to be extended for a further five-year period.  It is important that the legislation is brought through the House as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">With regard to the Minister's role in dispute resolution with people who are in dispute with NAMA, my colleague, Deputy Seán Fleming, proposed an amendment when the legislation was published.  It is a common sense approach.  I agree with Deputy Fleming that the Minister should not have a function or role in dispute resolution.  There is much merit in providing that any dispute that exists between NAMA and a loan-holder should go before the Commercial Court.  The handling of the Zoe Group proceedings recently has shown the Commercial Court has the ability and personnel to deal with these complex commercial disputes.  Removing the Minister of the day from that role is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">I turn now to the issue of phoenix directorships.  This subject has been discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts in both private and public session.  There has been a trend in this country of people winding down and liquidating businesses and leaving debts unpaid.  In the case of NAMA, there must be provision for these phoenix-type creatures who think they can walk away from a commitment they have to NAMA and subsequently engage in a transaction with NAMA by buying, for example, a performing loan from the agency further down the road.  There must be a clear statement that NAMA will not tolerate any phoenix-type transactions, where people who have defaulted on a loan or transaction can later engage in a different transaction with the agency and conclude it successfully.  That is most important.  That is the course we must take.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">During this debate on the principle of NAMA there was a reference to the 40 economists who had put their names to a document which stated that NAMA was not the way forward.  NAMA is one proposal and there were many other proposals, including a proposal from the Labour Party and one from Fine Gael.  In the interests of balance, it should be pointed out that more than 250 economists were contacted and asked to put their names to the document.  Certainly, that is the information circulating in the public domain.  If 250 were contacted and 40 put their names to the document, 210 did not.  People will have different opinions as to how we should proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">There is a risk with NAMA.  It is not a bailout for developers.  The Minister has stated categorically that NAMA will pursue each developer to comply with the requirements of their loan obligations.  Each loan as it is being taken over requires 300 separate pieces of information.  This is a thorough approach, which is important.  NAMA is a bailout for the banks, as has been said by other speakers.  We are helping the banking system by bailing it out, but we are not bailing out developers.  They will be pursued rigorously.  However, we must have a banking system.  There has always been a functioning banking system in this country.  We rely on it for every aspect of life.  Whether one is a child or old age pensioner, one needs a functioning banking system, and to sit back and allow it to collapse would be a dereliction of responsibility.  It is a necessity.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">We must proceed by addressing the issues, such as the concerns and examples raised by Deputies Feighan and Burke.  To sit back and do nothing would only make the situation worse.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_779">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the NAMA legislation.  This legislation has been called the most important since independence, but I contend that the blanket guarantee extended to the banks on 30 September last year was equally seismic.  The decision to offer a blanket guarantee to all the major financial institutions closed off many of the options open to the Government and has led us to this position and this momentous legislation.  Then, as now, the Labour Party opposed the blanket guarantee.  It is fair to point out that we were right then and I suspect we will be proved right again.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The Labour Party has consistently and calmly argued that the temporary nationalisation of the two major financial institutions in Ireland, AIB and Bank of Ireland, is the least worst option for the Irish people.  Temporary nationalisation would allow the Government to control both ends of the deal, eliminating any potential for overvaluing or undervaluing assets which are to be transferred.  Instead, the Minister has categorically stated that we are to pay well above market value to the banks for their delinquent assets, using an inflated long-term economic valuation method.  This is purely to shore up the banks' balance sheets and prevent the otherwise inevitable nationalisation of the banks which can no longer survive in the capitalist market, from which they were happy to profit for decades.  As the economist Karl Whelan recently noted: "The idea that the only possible way to deal with banks in difficulty is to overpay them for their assets is, frankly, ridiculous."</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The major flaw in the Government's NAMA scheme is the deliberate, delusional decision to overpay for assets when the market has not yet bottomed out.  This decision was described yesterday by the Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz as "criminal".  Many assets have fallen by substantially more than 47%.  Indeed, the "Prime Time" television programme recently showed a view of a field in the Taoiseach's bailiwick of Edenderry which was previously valued at over €12 million but is now valued at under €2 million.  There is simply no credible, non-partisan information to support the Minister's contention that we have reached the bottom of the market.  A number of commentators across the economic and political spectrum have written that the Minister's figures simply are not correct and that values have fallen further than this and have further yet to fall.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">That the share prices of AIB and Bank of Ireland rose 25% on the day after the full details of NAMA were announced is proof that the markets believe the State is significantly overpaying for these assets.  There are hundreds of other land banks dotted around towns and villages in the country with a similar story of grossly inflated prices and no prospect of development, particularly if planning laws of any substance are introduced.  All these land banks will be transferred to the National Asset Management Agency and taxpayers will be left shouldering the burden for decades to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">Dublin, which has the greatest potential for a property bounce, has a commercial vacancy rate that is projected to rise to 27% in 2010, the highest in 18 years.  Nationally, almost 80,000 houses, apartments and sites are for sale on the <i>Daft.ie </i>website.  On a drive from Dublin to Sligo or Kerry one will pass through towns which have a glut of unsold commercial developments or housing estates on which construction has ground to a halt.  It is unlikely that there will be a need for these houses and commercial spaces for years to come and certain they will not be worth what NAMA paid for them.  Instead, they will be owned by us, the taxpayers, a monument to incompetent regulation, avaricious bankers and greedy developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">The Minister has stated that the principal concept behind NAMA is to get the real economy moving again by allowing banks to lend.  However, €36 billion will go to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society which loaned almost exclusively to big developers and whose reputations are beyond recoverable.  Irish Nationwide will transfer 76% of its loan book, almost €8 billion, to NAMA, while Anglo Irish Bank will transfer almost €28 billion to the agency.  There is no value in paying these sums to the two institutions in question as they will never again lend in the real economy.  It is dead money.  We have already paid €4 billion into Anglo Irish Bank, which has to be supported from direct Exchequer borrowing this year and on which we have no prospect of ever seeing a return.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The €36 billion from NAMA which will go into these two zombie institutions is more than the entire tax take for this year.  This sum would pay for metro north six times, cervical cancer vaccine for 12 year old girls for 3,000 years and cover the school book grant for 4,000 years.  It could provide for a substantial, sustained early child care intervention scheme tackling educational, health and social issues at the level where most can be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Why should taxpayers bail out Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, the homes of golden circles, loans to inflate balance sheets, executive loans and million dollar bonuses for people who run their companies into the ground?  Bernie Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in jail just six months after being arrested.  Unlike the United States, the authorities here do not appear capable of forcing those guilty to be held to account, to do the "perp" walk.  How can we jail 167 people between 2003 and 2007 for not paying their television licence fee, while allowing those guilty of impoverishing the future prospects of the country to continue to play golf?</p>
          <p eId="para_787">We need real regulation that will completely clear out those responsible for the catastrophe the banking sector has caused the real economy.  This must be done without any more golden handshakes, particularly as they are now being funded by taxpayers' money.  It seems, however, that Fianna Fáil is not capable of introducing legislation that would end the cosy relationships they have enjoyed for more than a decade.  The party has shown this in FÁS and other semi-State boards and it will be the same old story in NAMA, under which the plain people of Ireland will be forced to shoulder the pain of the elites who creamed it during the boom.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">The Minister has stated the National Asset Management Agency will pursue developers for everything they owe.  The banks have admitted they have rolled up more than €9 billion in unpaid interest on developers' loans.  This hardly paints a picture of a determination to pursue developers.  The only bank which went after Liam Carroll and the Zoe Group is not Irish and not involved in NAMA.  The NAMA banks were happy to nurse Mr. Carroll's loans until they could be transferred to the National Asset Management Agency when they would become the problem of the State, that is, the taxpayer.  It is individuals such as Mr. Carroll that NAMA will reward, not those struggling with negative equity on whose homes banks are waiting to foreclose or small and medium size enterprises which will have to close because they cannot obtain credit.  Thanks to the Supreme Court, we may get a solitary scalp but the majority of the developers and bankers will continue to be treated with the hospitality their years of donations to the Fianna Fáil Party have built up.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">I, like every speaker in this debate, am aware that a large number of people are in negative equity.  Worse still, mortgage lenders, namely, the banks, are waiting to pounce and foreclose on such people.  People in negative equity do not have a national asset management agency available to them.  The other evening I was visited by a constituent whose son and daughter-in-law face the prospect of having their home repossessed because they cannot meet the repayments on a 100% mortgage.  No one shouted "Stop" when these types of loans were being provided by the financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">Businesses are going to the wall because they are paying unrealistic rents.  According to a survey supplied by Retail Excellence Ireland, 86% of businesses have requested a rent reduction.  Of these, 52% need a rent reduction of between 16% and 40% to break even.  Despite these figures, the Minister has put the kibosh on legislation to allow for downward rent reviews.  As a result, small businesses will face even greater difficulties.  It appears this has been done to protect the banks and speculators which own the shopping centres and prime retail streets.  The result has been to keep rent yields artificially high.  If the Minister was true to his pious assertion that the protection of the real economy was paramount, we would have had late night sittings to pass legislation to allow for downward rent reviews.  Such reviews would take pressure off the real businesses providing employment and paying taxes, rather than the speculators who are probably tax fugitives and the bankers whose august organisations continue to exist only because of the intervention of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">The Government should give practical consideration to alternatives to NAMA which would primarily look after the interests of taxpayers, small businesses and those who are about to lose their homes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_354">
          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_792">While this debate is being overshadowed by other events, the division on the National Asset Management Agency Bill will be the biggest decision most of us in this House will make.  This is all the more reason for Committee Stage to be taken in this Chamber and not condemned to the basement.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The stakes are enormous.  In particular, there has been much criticism of the price to be paid by the State for impaired loans.  As Deputy Upton noted, last night, the Nobel prize winner, Joseph Stiglitz, went so far as to describe as criminal overpaying the banks for loans.  Professor Stiglitz argues that temporary nationalisation of the banks, if required, is a better way to go, a view shared by the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">When the Minister for Finance published this Bill it was described as the "only show in town" and alternative propositions were rejected out of hand.  No basis was provided for this extraordinary claim.  Where is the empirical evidence?  If a panel of objective experts from outside this country had given an assessment of the various options, we may have had a very different Bill to debate.  Instead, we have spurious claims from the Government and the repeated "only show in town" mantra.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The Minister for Finance referred to reform of the banks.  While there must be no return to the recklessness and greed of the past, it is not clear how the Government will ensure restructuring of the banks will lead to better banking.  Many of the same people who were part of the problem are still <i>in situ</i>.  More important, will credit flow to where it is needed?  The Minister for Finance stated, “The Government has made SME lending a major priority.”  It is clear, however, that while NAMA is designed to protect the banks from collapse, it does nothing to create the conditions for facilitating credit for business.  When it comes to securing credit from the banks at present, while it may be technically available, it is available only in the way that the Ritz Hotel is open to anyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Business overdrafts are being slashed and incredibly onerous conditions are being attached to securing mortgages.  The legislation makes no mention of lending by the banks, let alone requiring banks to lend for viable business purposes in return for the bailout.  The Labour Party does not advocate reckless lending to the business sector by the banks.  We have seen enough of this practice for a lifetime.  The banks have been lending hand over fist to the wrong people.  It is this that has us in such trouble.  We must now ensure they lend to the right people, namely, small and medium enterprises which form the backbone of our economy.  We cannot depend on empty words of reassurance from the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">International experience over the past year has shown that where a bank bailout has occurred, the focus has been on shoring up the capital base of the bank to satisfy shareholders and to pay bonuses rather than lending to businesses. The banks' purpose is to get back into profitability.  That means achieving a balanced ratio between credit and deposits.  In the current climate it means that businesses lose out.  Dermot Desmond wrote a newspaper article recently which warned that NAMA would result in economic paralysis for decades to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">What are the Government plans to deal with the issue of credit?  How will the Minister use his influence on the banks to resolve it?  It is a central issue, regrettably not just for the business sector.  Already houses are being repossessed and families are losing their homes.  When interest rates rise — as they invariably will — the trickle could become a flood and the Government has no strategy to prevent the consequences.  That is insupportable at a time when so many people are at risk of losing their homes.  An ESRI study predicts that 35,000 people may be unable to pay their mortgages next year.  I urge the Minister to accept the Labour Party proposal for a home protection commission to address that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">Many speakers have raised their concern about the lack of credit being made available to SMEs and I have no doubt the Minister will refer to this matter in his closing speech, but there is a further aspect to this issue which may prove to be even more damaging in the longer term.  We all look to signs of the future recovery whenever it happens.  We need to be prepared to exploit its potential, whether by upskilling our workforce or improving our broadband infrastructure now, but when that time comes the priority for the banks will still be profitability not the provision of credit to businesses which want to expand in the upturn and take on staff.  The prospect of ongoing stagnation referred to by Dermot Desmond could prove crippling for our economic growth and development and is why Mr. Stiglitz worries about what will happen not in 2010 but beyond it.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">NAMA is a big gamble and the Government is intent on taking it, whatever we on this side of the House think, but I ask that the Bill at least be amended to provide safeguards for the public.  For example, provision should be made for a whistleblowers' charter to cover staff in NAMA, covered institutions, debtors, advisers and service providers to ensure the highest ethical standards.  Accountability needs to be stitched into the Bill so that robust checks and balances ensure Ministers cannot use NAMA for their own purposes.  Under the Bill its chairman and chief executive are precluded from discussing policy matters with any committee of the Oireachtas; that restriction should be lifted in the interests of public accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">Concerns have also been expressed about the capacity of NAMA to address its brief.  Managing a highly complex portfolio worth €77 billion, covering some 20,500 loans linked to almost 2,000 developers' business plans is an absolutely staggering challenge.  NAMA could be managing one of the largest property portfolios in the world and it is hard to believe that the expertise and resources will be equal to the task.  It is important that the Minister consider that point and address it in his speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I want to make some simple points.  One concerns the situation which local authorities, mine in particular, have found themselves.  As a result of the compulsory purchase legislation land was to be acquired and the local authority now finds itself, at the end of a fairly lengthy process, having to pay an enormously inflated price for land which is worth only a fraction of what it was because of the economic collapse.  We should be carefully examining ways of ensuring that local authorises are not left in such a position, particularly at a time when they are being starved of funds, and that there is also a social dividend.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">I noted on Monday the Labour Party Senator Dominic Hannigan published research he carried out into the recreation and social needs of young people in the commuter belt around Dublin.  He made the point that there should be a social dividend.  When one considers the amount of empty space that exists now and will become the responsibility of NAMA at some point, there needs to be a social dividend in terms of how NAMA operates, if it is, regrettably, passed by the House.  At this point we still have the opportunity to find a better route and the alternative route which has been recommended by so many eminent economists.  Unfortunately the Government is deaf to a clear analysis of what can and should be done, particularly taking into account the international experience and the needs of our country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Beverley Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_804">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  As previous speakers have mentioned, the NAMA Bill is arguably the most important piece of legislation to come before Dáil Éireann in the lifetime of this State.  It is the Dáil's considered response to solving the problems of the parlous state of our economy, restoring our finances, underscoring the importance of a functioning banking system and ensuring that we return to the growth we experienced over the past decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">The NAMA Bill is a multifaceted instrument which attempts to find a middle path through sometimes conflicting interests and competing priorities.   However, although we here as legislators may debate NAMA or how, in our wisdom, we finally agree on what direction it should take, there is a far larger audience which must be convinced not only of the need for what we are doing but that we are doing the right thing.  I am referring to the people of Ireland, that is, the taxpaying public whose faith in the institutions of State has been badly shattered over the past 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Sometimes I wonder whether we in this House fully realise the depth of anger, bitterness and resentment of ordinary people at the litany of greed, incompetence and mismanagement which has brought us to where we are today.  People have grown cynical and it is this cynicism which has bred a deep distrust of the banking system, and NAMA is all about the banking system.  This public mistrust has in turn created a climate where a couple of glaring untruths about NAMA have been allowed to take hold and because they have been repeated without challenge often enough are now regarded as accepted fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The first is that we are mortgaging our future, our children's future and our grandchildren's future because of NAMA.  This is the big lie which has gone uncorrected for so long as to be an article of truth in the minds of the public.  If one talks to people on the street, listens to any talk show on local or national radio or reads the letter pages of any newspaper the message is the same.  People believe we are saddling ourselves with a millstone of debt to meet the cost of NAMA and they will not be convinced otherwise.  It is all very well for us here to realise that not one penny of taxpayers' money will go to pay for the day to day running of NAMA or that not one cent of the tax take to balance our finances is going to shore up the banks or their owners.  That is not the perception among the public and if NAMA is to succeed we need to win the hearts and minds of the ordinary people who have taken such a buffeting from the establishment that they simply refuse to believe a word they are told any more.  It is vital that we get across the message that the whole concept of NAMA is that it becomes a self-financing operation with any profit accruing to the taxpayer and any losses to be absorbed by way of levy on the banking institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The second major lie which has equally come to be accepted as fact is that NAMA is somehow a ploy to bail out the builders and developers who have come unstuck as the bubble burst and are now sinking in the quicksand of debt.  We need to emphasise that for big borrowers nothing has changed.  The developer who owed €20 million before his loan was transferred to NAMA will still owe €20 million; not only that, he will be vigorously pursued until every last cent of the principal and interest has been recovered.  We cannot allow this belief to go unchallenged, just as we must ensure NAMA is seen to be driven and robust enough to recover its debts without fear or favour to any business or developer.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">I want to move to something to which the Taoiseach referred in his speech a number of weeks ago.  It is something which is causing grave distress to thousands of mortgage holders who find themselves in hock to the banks and who find the same bank quite inflexible when they seek to deal with them.  The Taoiseach referred to a statutory code of conduct under which banks will refrain from acting on repossession until there are arrears of six months.  However, that is not the case on the ground.  Mortgage holders are being hounded by banks under all sorts of threats.  Those in mortgage arrears should be allowed a period of grace until such time as things pick up, which they will in time, and those in default now can start making full repayments again. There is a marked contrast between the leniency that has been shown to the banks and the attitude of the banks to those who find themselves in arrears and are unable to meet their repayments.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">We are all familiar with the biblical parable of the servant who owed his master 10,000 talents but was unable to pay.  The master ordered that the servant should be sold into slavery, along with his wife and children, and that all his possessions should be seized to pay the debt.  When the servant threw himself at his master's feet and begged clemency, the master felt so sorry for him that he cancelled the debt and let him go.  I hope this analogy is not lost on anybody in the House.  At a later time, the servant met a fellow servant who owed him a hundred denarii.  He seized him by the throat and demanded his money, at which point the other servant fell to the ground and asked for mercy.  The servant would not agree to this and instead threw the other servant into prison.  When the master heard this story, he became so angry that he sent for the servant, berated him for his lack of charity and turned him over to some torturers.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">I am not sure whether the Minister's remit extends to turning this country's bankers over to torturers.  Many people would prefer if it did.  I suggest that he should exert the full powers of his ministerial office by calling on them to show leniency to those who are unable to meet their full repayments through no fault of their own.  I refer to people who do not wish to default on their debts, but whom circumstances have left unable to pay their mortgage dues in full in the short term.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">A few days ago, I received an e-mail from a constituent that made the exact same point as the parable I have outlined.  The man who sent me the e-mail will not be covered by NAMA because he owes a bank less than €5 million.  The treatment that will be given to those covered by NAMA involves working through their problems in a way that will secure the best possible return for the State.  By contrast, people like the man who sent me the e-mail are not getting the same treatment because they owe less than €5 million.  He owes €1.5 million to a bank because he was unable to sell some houses he had built due to the nature of the housing market when they were completed in 2008.  For a while, he negotiated rolled-up interest with his bank.  He has decided to rent the houses because there is no sales market.  The rent is enabling him to pay the interest on his loan.  His loan is performing at present, as he is paying the interest on it.  In recent weeks, his bank contacted him to say he must sell the houses even though the market for them is in a depressed state.  The man has given his family's home and all his family's assets as security to the bank, in addition to this investment.  The total value of his family's home and assets is €1.6 million.  The debt he owes to the bank is €1.5 million.  The bank is showing the man no leniency, even though he is paying the interest on his loan at present.  It wants to get the capital back.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">It is interesting to compare that approach with the lenient manner in which the State is dealing with the banks.  We are giving them an opportunity to work out their problems over a period of time, which contrasts with how the large bank in this case is treating one of its customers.  It knows it will not get a pay day in this instance because the man owes less than €5 million and therefore will not be covered by NAMA.  I intend to highlight the manner in which this man is being thrown to the wolves at another forum.  It illustrates the point I am making, which applies to business people just as it does to mortgage holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">When people contact me to speak about their mortgages, they tell me it is possible to negotiate a six-month interest-only period on one's mortgage if one's back is completely to the wall, one has absolutely nothing and there is nowhere for the bank to go.  That period might even be extended to 12 months if one's circumstances are particularly difficult.  If one has any liquidity whatsoever — if one has 1 cent in one's savings account — the bank will show one no flexibility.  They will bleed one for every small bit of cash one has.  As far as I am concerned, it is an irresponsible approach for the banks to be taking at this time.  The public interest directors that will be on the boards of the banks to act on behalf of the Minister for Finance will have to do something about the way the banks conduct their business.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">The manner in which the banks calculate their interest payments has been a bone of contention with me for some time.  I welcome the commitment by AIB and Bank of Ireland to increase their lending capacity to small and medium enterprises by 10%, compared with 2008, as part of the overall NAMA package.  While this is welcome, with the best will in the world it brings us back to the innate conflict between what the Minister would like to happen and what the real practicalities of business will dictate.  Bankers will gladly lend to any borrower whose credentials are good, whose business plan looks secure and who seems to have a safe prospect of repaying his or her loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">We cannot ask the banks to extend credit to those who are unlikely to pay, as that is why we are in our present mess.  One cannot legislate for commercial decisions, even if one might wish to.  That is one of the reasons I disagree with the idea of nationalising the banks on a temporary basis.  There is a conflict between the commercial realities banks have to face every day and the political realities we have to face in this House.  That is why I do not think temporary nationalisation is a good idea.  The manner in which the Minister is proceeding at this time represents the right approach.  While it might not be perfect, it is the best option available to us.  One of the strongest arguments against temporary nationalisation is that political decisions and commercial decisions are oil and water.  They simply do not mix.  We would be pulled between urging the banks to free up their lending and provide more credit to small enterprise and having equal regard for the realities of commerce.  What powers can we exercise to ensure the base rates of interest being charged by the banks are fair and reasonable?  How can we be sure that customers will not be fleeced once again as rates are pushed upwards, little by little, by opportunist lenders?  We must find a way of policing interest rates.  I suggest that one of the main duties of the public interest bank directors should be to insist that banks do not start to crucify the borrower with unjustified rates of interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I have already mentioned one of my constituents, who owes €1.5 million to a bank.  I should have mentioned that in the middle of his crisis, while he was renting his houses and making his interest repayments, the bank increased his loan rate by a further 1%, at a time when the European Central Bank rate was the lowest it has been for many decades.  The bank added a further 1% to the repayments of a man who was making his interest repayments.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">I would like to speak about the related issues of funding and how the banks calculate their base rates at present.  The banks' base rates were based on the one-month Euribor rate until 2007, but they were changed to the three-month Euribor rate when it was decided it was safer to base lending rates on longer deposit terms, which seemed reasonable.  However, rather than looking at the three-month Euribor rate as it currently stands, some of the banks have decided to look at the average three-month rate over a three-month period.  The rate stands at 0.73% today, but the average over three months is 0.876%.  It is immediately evident that the banks are getting the benefit of a premium by averaging it over three months.  In addition, the banks are charging a significant funding premium at present.  When one goes into the bank to negotiate one's rate, one is told it will be the base rate plus a margin.  There is now a significant funding premium within the margin.  It is 0.75% for amounts up to €1 million and it is even more for amounts above €1 million and for extended terms.  If one includes the minimum 0.75% rate and considers the averaging that is done over three months, one is almost looking at an additional 1% on top of one's rate of interest.  Given that the present European Central Bank rate is 1%, the addition of three months' money at 0.73% and the additional 1% means that there is a 100% loading on the premium.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">I ask the public interest directors who will sit on the boards of the banks whether such additions are acceptable at a time when customers, particularly mortgage holders, are finding it difficult to survive and small businesses are being crucified.  Most of the banks will tell one that the funding premium will remain in place in the medium term.  How long will it last?  I accept that it has been difficult for the banks to access moneys on the inter-bank markets over the last six months, as the credit rating of the banks has disimproved, but that situation is improving all the time.  At what stage will we be informed that the funding premium is to be removed from people's margins?  I understand that it is itemised separately in their loan agreements.  At a time when the banks are being shown leniency by the Government, it is important that the customer is seen, at least, to get a fair deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">What happens to those with loans of less than €5 million?  Where is NAMA for them?  Perhaps we should be examining bankruptcy legislation, which is particularly onerous in this country and which debars a person from business for a period of 12 years.  Could a mechanism be found whereby a long previous history of exemplary credit compliance can be taken into account when a person hits the wall of short-term insolvency?  I refer to the short term because this type of person is industrious and motivated enough to get back on his or her feet at the first opportunity.  As someone who knows a fair amount about bankruptcy legislation, I suggest that 12 years is a life sentence for bankruptcy.  In the current economic climate, a lot of people who have built up good credit ratings now find themselves in a difficult position.  It is important that they are given an opportunity because at the end of the day we have to kick-start the economy.  In some countries people can get out of bankruptcy in as short a period as 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">It is important to emphasise that NAMA will have a significant income stream from the outset.  Many of the loans being taken over are good enough to ensure that what comes in will exceed what goes out.  In addition, one third of NAMA's holdings will be linked to overseas property in places where the slump has not been so severe and where assets can be liquidated more quickly and advantageously.  In any event, NAMA must look to the long term so as to ensure an orderly disposal of its assets over time rather than do anything which smacks of a sell quickly approach to its holdings.  It must ensure that the disposal of its massive portfolio of lands and buildings is conducted in a balanced way and that supply must not exceed demand, sluggish though demand might be in the near future.  A situation cannot be allowed arise whereby the sequence of property disposal is flagged to the extent that developers will hold back for what is in the pipeline.  Our demands of NAMA in terms of asset enhancement are not particularly high and a 1% growth rate per year should not be too much to ask.  This, of course, assumes that the starting point has been correctly set by the Minister for Finance and those who advise him.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">There is, however, one caveat in regard to what we expect of NAMA and how it deals with the disposal of its assets.  There is in some quarters a view that NAMA should look to its social obligations and that a social dividend should come from the sudden acquisition of lands and buildings across the state.  While we might agree with the notion of NAMA becoming the benefactor of houses, schools sites, hospitals, community buildings and other desirable social needs, we must prioritise its commercial remit.  The role of NAMA is to maximise to the utmost its revenue on behalf of the State to ensure that the taxpayer is the ultimate beneficiary.  If assets lend themselves to be used for school buildings, social housing or community projects, they should be acquired from NAMA at market prices by the agencies charged with catering for the various social needs.  NAMA must operate as a commercial agency.  If it is to have credibility, it must be just as hard nosed and implacable in dealing with its debtors as the banks should have been.  It must also be allowed to work out its brief even if it takes up to ten or 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">In supporting NAMA we are embarking on a strategy which will bring order to our finances and restore us to the path of national growth.  I totally reject the falsehoods that we are condemning future generations to a millstone of debt or that we are colluding in a plot to save the financial skins of bankers and developers.  The Minister is to be commended on the detailed planning and thorough research which has gone into bringing NAMA to this stage.  He has minimised the risk to the public purse while at the same time providing a vehicle which will enable the economy to start working again.  The decision on NAMA has now been taken and the framework is in place.  That is the easy part but we will only know if the correct decision was made if NAMA is made to work.  NAMA will speed our recovery and restore our finances to the stability we enjoyed for so long and I am pleased to voice my support for the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</from>
          <p eId="para_827">It is difficult to follow Deputy Flynn given her vast experience of banking systems and finances.  I will preface my remarks by noting that NAMA is manna from heaven for the banks.  This is the most expensive Bill that the taxpayer may ever have to face.  There is a crisis and we are being forced to bail out the banking institutions once again but what about the people who are sunk up to their necks in debt by borrowing from these very same banks?  Such people were offered loans of up to 110% from banks to purchase their homes at exorbitant prices.  The banks have been the architects of their own misfortune and we should not be bailing them out unless they give a guarantee that they will bail out the common people of Ireland who are up to their necks in debt by promising not to acquire their homes or put them out on the roadside.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">We are here today because the proper controls and safeguards were not in place.  I blame the Governments that have been in power since 1997 for following the market like sheep instead of providing leadership and good governance.  At times they even added fuel to the fire of greed.  In 1997, the economy was sound and strong.  The volume of exports, which in 1997 was growing at 17% has collapsed to nearly zero.  Under the Fine Gael-Labour Government productivity was growing at 8% per annum but it has now collapsed to negative figures.  Our market share increased by 25% in four years but this Government has cut it back by over 20% in a similar period.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">It is said that money is the root of all evil.  All the recent scandals involved other people's moneys.  It is well known that finance has been the cause of trouble since Adam was a boy.  Did our Lord not put the money lenders out of the temple because they were extracting money from the poor people of that age?  In nearly all the recent controversies it has been the handling of other people's money that has caused problems whether they be among taxpayers, bankers, developers, Ministers, officeholders, stockbrokers, shareholders, bondholders, savers or solicitors.  Should I not state that the mishandling of this money put us where we are today?</p>
          <p eId="para_830">The Minister for Finance may claim to have the misfortune to take up office at the wrong time but he also has the misfortune that the person partly responsible for this mess is now his boss.  The nub of the problem is that the Minister can never be too hard on the banks.  They remind me of smokers.  Regardless of how much they are taxed or curtailed, they continue their habits.  I understand the number of smokers has increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">We do not have the Mafia in Ireland but the banks are one of the largest of the groups involved in criminal behaviour.  They have run rings around every measure the Government has introduced since it came to power in 1997.  Do I have to remind Deputies of the DIRT inquiry involving every strand of banking in Ireland, the Faldor scandal involving tax evasion by senior executives in AIB, the ever recurring overcharging by all the banks on every type of transaction, the Cayman Islands accounts, the bank directors loans, the resignations of numerous senior executives and the scandal in National Irish Bank?  While researching this subject, I was not surprised to come across an example not from the last century but from the one before that.  In 1885 the Munster Bank failed due to mismanagement and fraud and was liquidated.  Out of the ashes, however, the Munster and Leinster Bank commenced operations.  Eventually, it became the largest of the three banks.  I have never understood the difference between the person in a suit who robs one's money and the person who robs one's money in the street or from one's home or business.  The public does not understand either, but they are asking why there is no one in jail for all of these offences.  With this in mind, I note that at a meeting of the Dublin Bar solicitors last week a question was raised as to whether solicitors should continue to hold client moneys, and it was stated that accountants do not and there have been very few irregularities in the accountancy sector.  We need to introduce legislation in this area as soon as possible.  We then need to introduce new comprehensive legislation governing the use of other people's money, whether by bankers, stockbrokers, Ministers or whoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">This legislation must provide stiff penalties for those who break the rules.  They must be tried like ordinary criminals and there should not be a delay because of other inquires, commissions or regulatory authorities.  The bank robber does not get these get-out-of-jail cards and the person on the other side of the counter should not either.  The main deterrent to committing crime is the prospect of getting caught and if we increase the chances of, and penalties for, getting caught, we will reduce the possibility of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">I also note the complete absence of involvement in these scandals by one segment of Irish society, amounting to more than half the population, namely, women.  In noting that women must pay the price being extracted from the taxpayers for these crimes, I encourage the Minister to ensure that there are many more women involved at the very top of all of our financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">This Government has a long way to go to make amends for its bad government over the past 12 years and the taxpayer still must take his or her piece of flesh for its incompetence.  The sooner the Government is gone the better it will be for all the citizens of this country who must pay a massive penalty for its bad government.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I want to put on record that the IFA is concerned that the proposed 80% rate of capital gains tax on the disposal of rezoned land will have major negative consequences for farmers and for the rural economy for the following reasons.  It is an attack on the right to free sale of private property and may drive sales of farm land into the black economy.  It is an inequitable imposition on farmers who intend to stay farming but have land rezoned by State or local authorities.  It will strongly discourage disposal of land and thus will stifle development in rural Ireland.  It is viewed by farmers as a political over-reaction to national economic and financial problems not caused by farmers, but farmers will be the main victims of this decision. Because windfall gains are much more a feature of the recent past than the immediate future, and because a tax rate of 80% is likely to discourage disposals, such a tax will yield very little to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">While recognising that there is a precedent from the 1980s for a somewhat higher rate of capital gains tax on disposal of development land, the differential in the rate was 20%.  The Minister's proposal involves a differential of 55% over the normal rate of capital gains tax. Tax rates as high as 80% are generally viewed as extremely regressive and distortionary.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">Before we give <i>carte blanche</i>  to the banks on NAMA we must get a guarantee from them that they will not impose the repossession of homes on ordinary men and women who have excessive loans.  Give the ordinary people of this country a chance and do not bolster up the vast empires of banking institutions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_838">Like everybody else, I am delighted to have an opportunity to say a few words on this matter, the most important legislation to come through the House in my time.  No doubt, as many more experienced than I would say, it is the most important legislation since the foundation of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">One should consider why this happened; our banking institutions collapsed.  People say the bankers should be fired, and they ask why this happened and why those in charge of the banks were given golden handshakes.  I would question first those who were looking after the banks.  It was a crying shame to allow the banking institutions do what they did in this country giving, not millions, but billions of euro of loans to different companies controlled by the same people, and nobody knew what was happening.  Three or four years ago, the banking institutions were reluctant to give mortgages or personal loans to small account holders with overdrafts or to give loans to people who wanted to set up in small businesses while at the same time another section of the banking institutions were throwing billions after billions of euro to the very same people to build new houses and to push up prices.  It ended up that the same people abused the system and now the entire banking institution has collapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The one institution we all — householders, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and companies — need is a bank.  One cannot operate without banks.  It is banks which lend money, no matter who the employer or how successful the person.  That is the job of banks and that is the reason they are in place.  They are a vital part of any economy — whether it be the household, small business, big business, builders or whoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">We need banking and I am all in favour of helping banks.  That is why my party supported the Government on the night, some months ago, when we were asked to secure the deposits in the banks.  I was proud that night that my party in opposition could stand up and state this is good for the country.  However, I was extremely concerned when NAMA and the rescue of the banks was proposed.  I was disappointed that the Government did not talk or listen to those on this side of the House who had much to say on the setting up of NAMA.  I have had dealings with banks for many years and have had my own differences with them from time to time, but I understand we all must deal with them from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">When the Minister spoke of €54 billion in loans, based on valuations of which nobody could state the origin, I was extremely concerned.  I received inquiries from auctioneers and valuers from outside Dublin who do not understand how they will get on the list of valuers.  I am perturbed that some of the bigger firms in Dublin might be appointed as valuers.  They do not know the price of land in Goleen in County Cork or in Golden in County Tipperary.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_845">It is important that the Minister opens up this to people who know the current valuation of property and land in a given area because such valuations can vary from parish to parish.  The valuers will have a difficult job.  I have nothing against Dublin valuers but it is the local valuers who should value the land.  Land that was valued some months or years ago as development land is now returning to agricultural land, and what is the price of agricultural land?  There is a major difference between the price of agricultural land in County Meath and in County Cork.  This issue is vital in determining the success or failure of the project.  I hope NAMA is successful because if not, it will be disastrous not just for our generation but for generations to come.  Ordinary people are worried.  There are people who are trying to set up small businesses and are under desperate pressure; speaker after speaker has mentioned them.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">I have an important query about the legislation.  Will the money given to the banks when the loans are taken over — which represents substantial funding for them — be lent to borrowers?  Will Bank of Ireland and AIB look after the people who are suffering?  Will they look after those who are on the live register today and the 400,000-odd who have ideas for small businesses?  Will something like this be written into the legislation?  That is imperative if the country is to improve its position.  There are people on those dole queues who do not want to be there and who have brilliant ideas.  I have met them in my constituency.  I see Deputy Mattie McGrath is up there ready to talk.  He can vouch for what I am saying because he has spoken against NAMA.  He has said locally that NAMA is not good for us and that he will vote against it.  I will hold him to that.  It is important that those people in our constituency who have ideas be helped out by the banking institutions.  We cannot turn our backs on them.  This should be written into the legislation.  There are so many more issues to talk about.  That is the problem with NAMA — it is so vast.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">There is one more issue I would like to discuss in my final few minutes — that is, the threat of an 80% windfall tax which will apply to the sale of land.  It is absolute madness.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">I will say it again: absolute madness.  It is something the Green Party would come up with — a proposal to take €80 out of every €100 earned when a person sells a site in rural Ireland for €50,000 or €100,000, even though most of these people are selling land because they want to prop up their businesses or farms.  If we want to keep rural Ireland alive, and if we have any interest in making Ireland greener, as the Green Party is supposed to, the first thing we need to ensure is that people have finance.  We must not crucify people with an 80% tax.  Most of them are trying to educate their children or care for their elderly relatives.  Deputy Curran has rural roots.  I ask him not to allow the Government to implement this.  He is closer to the Cabinet because he is a junior Minister.  He must not allow this to happen, for everyone's sake.</p>

          <p eId="para_853">I thank Deputy Hayes for prompting me on what he would like me to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I welcome the publication of the National Asset Management Agency Bill and I take the opportunity to congratulate our Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on his excellent work on the matter.  He has shown great leadership in recent months and, while the job he has been given is extremely difficult, he is doing a good job of getting the country back on track.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">There is fear that we are not moving quickly enough to tackle our problems and begin recovery, but I appreciate that the legislation took time to put together.  It is possibly one of the most important decisions we will take in our lifetimes so, while the delay is regrettable, it is vital that we get the Bill right so we can be sure it is the best option.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">I will correct Deputy Hayes in case he got carried away and thought I said I might vote against the Bill.  I expressed the concerns I have, like many other citizens, about NAMA.  I have received reassurances and I assure the Deputy there is no danger of my making a mistake in the lobbies when we come to vote on this.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_371">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_858">I was concerned about the major risk that we as a Government are taking on, and shared the concerns of every citizen in Ireland.  Many of us did not and still do not understand how NAMA will work and are worried about whether it will work out.  I was obliged to raise these concerns on behalf of my constituents recently.  I am pleased the Minister took steps to make his proposed legislation available to all concerned so it could be considered during the summer period.  This gave everyone the opportunity to suggest amendments.  I am even more pleased he has taken into consideration many of the amendments and ideas that have been put to him.  I remind my colleagues across the House that two of Fine Gael's former leaders who have major respect in economic circles — former Taoiseach Dr. Garret FitzGerald and former party leader Mr. Alan Dukes — have been honest about the situation, and I compliment them on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">One thing is certain: we must all pull together for the sake of future generations.  We must ensure we are taking the best possible steps to help our economic recovery and that we do not burden our children with high levels of debt that could have been avoided.  There has been much talk about NAMA over the past nine or ten months and, regrettably, when people hear the name they think of a bailout of bankers and developers.  Unfortunately, they are asking where the bailouts were when they got into difficulties.  They are asking where the Government was to help them keep their businesses open or repay their mortgages so they could stay in their homes.  We cannot blame families and businesses for asking these questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">I am not an economist but I welcome the fact that NAMA has been endorsed by the ECB and the IMF.  If NAMA is the best option, there are a few more steps we must take.  I welcome many of the new provisions in the Bill, of which many are vital.  I welcome the fact that the banks will share a large portion of the risk associated with NAMA.  One of the major fears expressed by many of my constituents is that the banks will be given the bonds but money will not be passed on to individuals or businesses.  Many people fear the banks will use these bonds to increase their profits again and that there will be no credit flow for small businesses or young couples who want to set up their own homes.  Such young couples are in many instances unable to get mortgages to build their houses even though they have secure employment.  We must ensure that no family home is repossessed.  As I said on other legislation recently, one's home is one's castle.  The family home must be protected and no family should be put out of their primary place of residence.  It is a different story if they own two, ten or 20 houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">People cannot be blamed for having such opinions of the banks given the disgraceful behaviour of our banking institutions in recent years.  Saying they were disgraceful is a mild way of putting it.  The banks must work with NAMA but they must also ensure credit flows to the economy, especially to small businesses, as credit is not currently flowing to businesses and there are no mortgages for young couples.  Many small businesses have already shut their doors and others are struggling to hold on.  I mentioned the delay in getting our economy moving again.  If NAMA is to work, cash must start to flow as a matter of urgency.  There is no point in codding ourselves.  We know on all sides of the House that the money is not being released by the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">When I speak of getting money flowing I do not mean reigniting the credit bubble and re-entering the madness.  I am talking about legitimate lending to the business people who have worked so hard over the years to ensure good credit ratings and who are now being starved of cash.  I know many such businesses as I am a small businessman.  They have built up modest overdrafts over many years of good working relations with the banks, and it is shameful that many banking institutions have now removed those overdrafts, which were never defaulted on or seldom used.  I know of business people who when they received large cheques for which they had waited a long time had those cheques used by the banks to pay off their overdraft when they lodged them to the bank to meet commitments they had made, which is outrageous.  I also know of small businesses that have had their overdrafts withdrawn even though they have never failed to pay a debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Are we guaranteed that the banks will start to lend to small businesses again?  While I welcome the risk equalisation which gives banks the incentive to work with NAMA, does it address this issue?  We must earmark a particular percentage of funding for small and medium sized businesses.  We must guarantee that possibly 20% of the funding made available to the banks will be returned to small businesses.  We must set the banks a limit otherwise this will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Many small businesses supplied materials, products or services to developers to complete their developments.  Many of these developments are now unfinished and are not saleable and the developers concerned are experiencing difficulties.  If they are taken under the control of NAMA what will happen to the sub-contractors, many of whom had to pay for materials and to pay their employees?  They are now left holding bad debts and cannot obtain funding from anywhere, resulting in their going into liquidation.  If these developments are taken under the control of NAMA, who will be responsible for the payment of these debts?  Will it be NAMA or the developer? If they remain with the developer, how will the debt be met if NAMA owns the development?  There is a great deal of clarification required in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">We must explore the option of having NAMA pay the small businesses the money they are owed in respect of the developments it is taking over?  Rather than NAMA paying the bank the full sum it should pay the small businesses a portion of what they are owed?  This would ensure that the cash starved businesses can continue to get by and will act as their source of sustenance going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">Confidence must be restored in our economy and small businesses must be supported.  They need to be allowed to continue trading.  Many of these small businesses which are the backbone of Irish society have not asked for bailouts or hand-outs and have never received any.  All they want is to be able to carry on trading and to be paid for their services so they in turn can pay their employees, support their families and pay their rates and taxes as before.  This would help to keep the economy moving in every county.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I was pleased to hear the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, stress during the summer that we will not bail out the developers, those who profited in the good times and those who could afford to take risks and that many of the developments concerned will end up as social housing.  I am a risk-taker.  It is said that to be in politics one must be a risk-taker.  Nevertheless, I am also a businessman and I understand what is involved when one takes risks.  I am not suggesting we should stifle everybody who took risks.  However, we should go after the greedy people who went too far and stretched themselves beyond what any reasonable person could justify.  I would like to see some social capital being invested in communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">While I acknowledge that many of the developers are now struggling like the rest of us, it is important to stress that with risk comes responsibilities and consequences.  Many developers and many of the bankers lost the run of themselves.  They wanted to make as much as they could and must have left their consciences at home when they made many of their decisions.  Many of them were, unfortunately, driven by greed.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">What went on in the banking system in recent years is nothing short of deplorable.  People are angry because they are being made to pay for the mistakes of others and, more important, for the "greed" of others.  They are angry that their vital services are being cut on a daily basis, that their future is uncertain and at the way we as a Government allowed this to happen and are tackling this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The bankers and developers involved in actions that were less than fully and morally right must pay for them and must repay their loans.  I am pleased to hear that all borrowers will be pursued by NAMA for their debts.  I am pleased, too, that the offices of the Garda Síochána and the Fraud Squad have been beefed up to investigate where wrongdoing took place.  While I acknowledge that one is innocent until proven guilty and is entitled to due process, the heavy hand of the law must come down on those people who flagrantly violated the rules and regulations, that they must be brought before the courts, given due process and must pay the price if they are proved guilty.  It is imperative that this point be stressed.  Also, we need to set the public straight about NAMA and what it will do.  It is not a bailout for developers and banks will not profit from it.  Steps need to be taken to ensure that remaining businesses are kept alive.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">We need to remove the thinking that NAMA is a bailout and must fully inform the public about what NAMA will do and how it will work.  The media has a moral responsibility to state the facts about NAMA and to help instil some confidence in our economy again.  As we all know — I am delighted to note Deputy P. J. Sheehan is nodding in agreement — confidence is at an all time low.  There is still money in the country; we did not become paupers overnight.  However, nobody has the confidence to invest in business here, businesses which would help to create much needed jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Another issue of importance is NAMA's use of the development land which it will take under its control.  NAMA will cost us a great deal of money and thus our services will suffer due to financial constraints.  The Government may never again get access to land at low prices.  Many communities have suffered from over-zoning and over development and any social capital gained should be invested in these communities.  I compliment those planners, including those in my own county, who resisted the temptation to allow crazy rezoning of land.  I, as a board member of the Irish Council of Social Housing, want that agency to be involved in taking over many of these unfinished or partly finished developments which could be used as social capital for the construction of community halls, resource centres or badly needed schools.  Given so many builders and developers are now idle we could get value for money in respect of the work required.  These lands and partly finished properties must be taken in charge and used for the greater good of our communities and all people who will be paying a price for NAMA but will never get anything from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">We should earmark some of this development land for future infrastructural developments, which are badly needed.  If NAMA is taking on some partially finished houses, will consideration be given to these houses being used for social housing?  We must use this opportunity to obtain the best return for the taxpayer and our future.  It is shocking that despite the Celtic tiger years more people are awaiting access to social housing and many more people are homeless.  This is a sad indictment of all of us.  We must put two and two together.  We cannot forget about the little person who, even when NAMA succeeds, will not benefit.  In taking this risk, we must ensure a valuable return for our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">With regard to job creation, we need to do much more.  Even with NAMA, new jobs are not guaranteed.  Banks may start lending again but that does not guarantee new investment or job creation as businesses need time to recover.  Earlier I congratulated the Minister, Deputy Lenihan.  I now plead with him and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan and their respective Departments to take every step they can to create new jobs and to support existing jobs.  While I do not wish to revisit old stories, there are in this country, organisations like NAMA which are penalising businesses.  While I accept that people must pay their taxes and rates, business people are crying out for some breathing space.  They have never before failed to pay their taxes or rates and will not do so now.  They need moratoriums and support.  It is vital that we reshape our Departments to meet people's needs.  We need more dynamic visionary Departments of State led by Ministers and top officials.  We also need to obtain fresh thinking from outside the Departments to reinvigorate and drive our economic recovery.  Irish business people will do this but they need some support.  They must be allowed to do it in an environment where they are not shackled by the constraints laid down by bureaucratic quangos that are literally driving them out of business.  While this economic downturn is difficult and uncomfortable, it is important for us as a nation to take a good look at ourselves and at how we do our business.  We must restore confidence in ourselves, in our banking system and in how we appear to the outside world.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">I pay tribute to the ordinary decent bank officials and public servants in these organisations who are on the receiving end of much of the public's agitation.  They had no hand, act or part in the way things went sour.  They were doing their jobs professionally.  They were not at the higher echelons and should not be blamed for this.  Sadly, greed was rife throughout the country in recent years and has made us suffer hugely.  As individuals, as business people and as a Government we must bring some integrity back into how we carry out our transactions.  We must ensure that our banking system is better regulated to ensure that actions like those of the golden circle will not happen again.  We cannot allow such a situation to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">There must always be due process but there must be tougher action against crime.  We see people who for small amounts of money are brought before the courts and imprisoned.  They should be asked to make recompense in some other way, instead of sending them to jail where there is no room for those who should be there.  The fraud squad and the Criminal Assets Bureau must be reinvigorated to deal with what has happened.  John Citizen knows that if he cannot feed his family or pay college fees and he takes something out of necessity, he will pay the price and be prosecuted.  The law of the land must be observed but it is unfair that only ordinary people are punished.  The perception that only ordinary people are punished must be fully explored and dealt with otherwise it will continue.  That perception is bad; it is unnerving and disquieting and must be eliminated.  We should have a fair playing field where every family will be dealt with equally.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">I will speak about other aspects of the golden circle later this evening in the debate on FÁS but this has been damaging to the body politic and to ordinary people who want to reinvest and get his country moving again.  The people are willing to put their shoulder to the wheel but they must see fair play and leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">If there is one lesson to come from this recession, it must be that we return some honesty, integrity and trust into two of our most important institutions: our Government and our banks.  Unless we instil some integrity, we will find ourselves in the same position in a few years' time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_372">
          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_879">I oppose the Bill before the House and support the Fine Gael position on NAMA.  The proposals are wasteful and represent a reckless use of taxpayers' money, with €7 billion being paid to banks over and above the value of the assets.  That is not a proper use of taxpayers' money at a time when people are bled dry due to economic circumstances and services are being cut in areas that are sensitive.  It is inappropriate when there are alternatives to these proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The Minister is buying unfinished developments and development land that has now reverted to its agricultural value.  Huge prices were paid in Dublin for development land.  Those of us in rural areas could not believe the prices that were paid for development land in the city.  I was a member of the constitutional committee that looked at this some years ago and we proposed that development land would be bought at agricultural values plus 25%.  The Government never entertained that idea even though it was strongly supported by the committee.  It would have controlled the situation and limited the growth of toxic assets that happened over a period of intense greed.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The situation was manipulated by the people who are now being bought out by the Government.  Lands were withheld from the system creating a market that ensured massive profits from development land for developers because of the limited amount of land that would be released to the market.  If an alternative approach based on our recommendations, including a consideration of a progressive tax on development land if it was not released for development, had been taken, we would not be in the position we are in now.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The Minister is giving the banks €12,273 for each person in the country.  That is what every man, woman and child will allocate from their resources over their lives.  A family of four will pay more than €50,000 in future taxation even though taxpayers are not responsible for the actions of some bankers.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">There is generalisation that the bankers are at fault but only some bankers are at fault.  The bank officials on the desks doing their daily work are not responsible for what has happened.  They do a good job and many of them have been destroyed by the actions of a few powerful people in the bank.  Their morale and job satisfaction has been destroyed by a powerful elite who became very greedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">The Government nationalised Anglo Irish Bank, the bank that did most damage.  It led the other banks, where the traditional approach had been to avoid these high risk ventures.  AIB Bank and Bank of Ireland had a conservative, reasonable approach but because Anglo Irish Bank was seen to be successful they followed suit.  That was one of the major problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The Minister must now recover massive loans from these developers.  They are the friends of the Government, of Fianna Fáil; they are the people who were entertained in the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway races.  The Minister should go after them but he has given them a lifeline in this proposal and that is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned small businesses.  What guarantees have the banks given that if they participate in NAMA they will then lend to small and medium enterprises?  This is crucial.  This Bill will be passed if the Green Party decides to remain in Government this weekend.  This Bill will go through if the Green Party stays in Government over the next weekend.  The Government should ensure that money will be allocated to small and medium sized businesses to ensure the retention of employment and the future creation of employment.  We would see the green shoots of economic recovery if that were to happen.  In bailing out the banks, an agreement must be made that they begin the bail out of the economy and of the people of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">I question the approach, the actions and the monitoring of the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator in this whole saga.  They stand accountable to the people and to the Oireachtas to explain why they did not monitor properly the actions of our banks, and why we see ourselves in this position today.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">Deputy Bruton drew attention to the former chief economist of the World Bank and a veteran of banking crises all over the world, Professor Stiglitz, who described as "criminal" the Government's proposed NAMA policy to deliberately overpay the banks by €7 billion for their toxic loans.  Professor Stiglitz said that to overpay for these loans is criminal, and he warned that the process will rob the taxpayer.  Together with George Soros, the professor is one of the prominent advocates of the Fine Gael good bank solution to fixing banks.  He joins financier Dermot Desmond, commentator David McWilliams and Mr. Michael O'Sullivan of Credit Suisse, among others.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_890">As Deputy Bruton stated, the approach outlined by the professor leaves the risk and responsibility for working out toxic developer loans with the bankers who made them, and with the investors who funded them, while also ensuring that a clear and healthy banking system is ready to restart lending.  The professor has rubbished the scaremongering by the Government and its banking friends that Fine Gael's tough policy on the banks will scare off private investors in Ireland and make it difficult for the Government to borrow money.  On the contrary, the professor has confirmed the Fine Gael view that protecting the taxpayer from banking losses is the best route to restoring Ireland's economic reputation and creditworthiness.  Nobody wants to lend or to invest in a country that caves in so easily to powerful financial interests.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_375">
          <from>Deputy Bernard Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_891">It is with great regret that I come here today to speak on this buyout Bill.  Our once mighty export economy has been brought to its knees by the current and immediate past administrations.  No two men have contributed more to the destruction of wealth in this State than the construction industry's chief cheerleader, former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the "asleep at the wheel" former Minister for Finance, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.  Builders and developers deserve blame for this catastrophe as well as the bankers who threw prudence out the window in pursuit of a quick buck.  However, they were facilitated at every turn by the organs of the State controlled by Fianna Fáil.  Where was the regulation?  It was dumbed down so that questions would not be asked and bankers could do what they liked.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">For the past five years, the economy has been run primarily for the benefit of the construction industry.  We knew the colour of the former Taoiseach's money when he asked why people urging caution on the economy had not committed suicide.  The current Taoiseach took up that cause to attack people for warning of what was ahead.  He said that the fundamentals were fine.  The country then slammed into the middle of an international credit crisis as badly prepared as any other, with the possible exception of Iceland.  Our property bubble was bursting and Brian Cowen was ignoring it until it was too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">It took the worst kind of Minister for Finance to allow what was a culture of complacency to creep into the Financial Regulator's office and into the Central Bank.  Even as the tide was going out there was no sense that either the then Minister for Finance or his successor were taking regulation seriously, until the directors of the banks themselves showed up one evening asking for their liquidity to be shored up on the back of the taxpayer.  Banks were giving each other dig-outs to fool any observers on directors' loans or the strength of their balance sheets.  It shamed this nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">The current Minister for Finance told us six months ago that this legislation was urgent.  He then realised he should be a lot more thorough in his thinking about the legislation, when Dr. Michael Somers came before the Committee of Public Accounts and warned us all about the legal pitfalls that were coming.  The Minister had to be shaken out of his complacency.  He then changed tack and the imperative to be urgent became the imperative to be thorough, even though the economic need was still urgent.  It has taken a long time for the Minister to do what has been urgently required and yet he will not do what is transparent and let the country see that the individual valuations are fair for all, including the taxpayer.  Having minimal scope for immediate scrutiny of a massive transfer of assets is a dangerous road for the Minister to take.  If the Green Party is serious about transparency, I trust it will do right by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">I have a series of questions for the Minister, and I will ask them now as time is short.  Is there any reason not to believe that every cent the banks receive on the strength of the money from the Government will go straight to pay off their debts?  In other words, has the Government anything at all in its plan to get credit back to small businesses?  So far, the answer has been a resounding "No".  Is the Government considering setting up a wholesale bank to get credit flowing again, as proposed by Fine Gael?  How much extra capital will Anglo Irish Bank need?  Will Irish Nationwide Building Society be wound up?  If so, at what cost?  How much extra capital will AIB and Bank of Ireland need?</p>
          <p eId="para_896">When will the third banking force come into being?  What is the book value of the property on loans under €5 million in the five banks?  What is the total book value of the five banks' non-performing loans outside of the NAMA-bound loans?  What is the total rolled up interest on these banks' books?  If credit is to flow, we must know if what is left with the banks is sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">Will all board members and top executives that drove the banks aground in 2008 and up to then be asked to leave within six months?  If the Carroll companies are spending tens of thousands of euro in the courts to get to NAMA, how insolvent will a company have to be to be wound up by NAMA?  Will NAMA be accepting the fanciful projections that were provided to the High Court by Carroll's companies and others?  Why is the Minister for Finance relying on rents as an indicator of the market bottoming out, when he knows about businesses being stuck with upward-only rent agreements and when we have had some of the highest rents in the world?  Will developers know the discount given for their loans?  What feedback on NAMA did the Government receive at the Irish diaspora economic forum?  Will NAMA be able to give developers discounts on their loans?  Will there be a change in the Government bank guarantee scheme introduced in September 2008?</p>
          <p eId="para_898">What will NAMA do with the hotels that may come into its control?  Will NAMA be able to liquidate a delinquent developer and transfer all the assets to another NAMA developer?  Has the Green Party accepted the principle of overpaying for these development loans?  Has the Green Party abandoned the whole principle of transparency?</p>
          <p eId="para_899">We are living in momentous times and the decisions we are confronted with in the next few months will reverberate in Irish life for decades.  Therefore, we must be brave and smart or we will lose much of what we still have after the Celtic tiger.  We must cut our cloth to fit our measure and move to shelter the vulnerable from the worst of the changes taking place.  We cannot ask the people of Ireland to pay billions more for assets than they are worth and also remain ignorant of the price they are paying for each one.  Our Government, which is the least trusted in the history of the State, is dealing with the industry that dominated its economic thinking over the last decade.  We cannot afford to let this pass and the questions must be answered before the vote is taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_905">It strikes me that the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will do anything to avoid publicising what price an individual property is transferred at, because he knows that once transparency becomes an element of NAMA,  his over valuation of loans will be made plain to the people.  It is a politics of secrecy at its most dangerous in order to pull the wool over people's eyes.  Now, the Minister wants to pay a phantom price for these assets and we will never know who or which individual benefited and how much from being in NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">Let this be a warning.  We have had the tribunals, seen the human frailties and the catastrophic banking failures and now the Minister wants us to roll the dice again without transparency.  Let the people know and be reassured that this is no sweetheart deal where cronies get a handout and builders continue to live their rock star lifestyle on borrowed money.  The common good must override the privacy of big developers and builders.  If the market eventually begins to function again, it will not matter significantly what valuation is published today.  It should not be a hard sell for the Green Party to stand firm on transparency in its traditional role of scrutinising development in this country.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasByrne" eId="spk_380">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_907">Deputy Allen's contribution was helpful and he asked useful questions.  However, it is interesting that his and other Opposition Members' contributions demonstrate that Fine Gael seems to have completely moved away from its original policy.  It also seems to have moved away from the allegation made at the start by the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance about  the selection of 1,500 developers.  It was irresponsible, wrong and reckless to allege that 1,500 developers were being hand-picked to go into NAMA.  That is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">When we examine legislation we are bringing through the House we must ask ourselves what the problem is that needs to be fixed.  In the case of NAMA, the problem that must be fixed relates to the number of development loans sitting on banks' books where in many cases no interest is being charged.  The Government had to do something about this.  My only criticism is that we should probably have introduced NAMA earlier.  However, other things were happening with the banking system.  What is at the heart of the Government's proposal is to ensure borrowers are repaying their loans where they can and if not to repossess the properties.  It is as simple as that.  The banks were not able or willing to do that.  Therefore, in the interest of the wider economy the Government must step in to make sure that is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">That is the reason I am astounded by the proposals made by Mr. Desmond and by Fine Gael.  The main advantage Fine Gael suggests its proposal has over NAMA is that the banks that made the loans may have better incentives, skills, information and estate agency experience to recover loans made to developers.  This is what Fine Gael has said in its policy paper.  It suggests the banks can do this and go after the developers.  However, the banks have not being doing this.  Where did Fine Gael make up this proposal?  The problem is the banks have not being doing it and Fine Gael cannot see the problem.  The banks have failed in that regard.  Mr. Desmond also has great faith in the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Faith in the banks is at the heart of the Fine Gael proposal.  What banks has Fine Gael given as examples of where its policy works?  It has given as examples Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley.  Is Fine Gael serious?  We are trying to get people back to work.  Hundreds of people in my constituency are about to lose their jobs in Aer Lingus, but Fine Gael tells us that if we do it like Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock, the economy will be back on track.  That is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">A letter sent to me from a Fine Gael Deputy, which looked like it was written in the Fine Gael press office, asked me why I have decided to support the bailing out of the 1,500 people NAMA intends to bail out.  I cannot understand how any Minister for Finance could hand pick 1,500 people.  NAMA is not about 1,500 people.  It is about 4 million people on this island to whom we need to return hope and confidence, not about the nonsense the Opposition has been raising about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">NAMA is the worst nightmare of builders and developers who have not being paying their loans.  We must get that fact across and that is the basis of my support for NAMA.  Fianna Fáil is very clear that people who borrowed money must pay it back.  Why should people who have not been repaying their loans be treated differently by the banks than the ordinary people we represent, who are not being treated in the same fashion?  The banks have not been doing their job and Fine Gael's and Dermot Desmond's faith in them is astounding.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">I support NAMA.  There have been many rumours about it.  Last night on television we heard one such rumour, namely that builders have not been selling apartments for the past nine months because they are waiting for NAMA.  The NAMA proposal was only made in April, so how can such rumours be true?  However, rumours are constantly being propagated by the Opposition against the interest of the people.  We can have reasonable discussion and questions like those of Deputy Allen, but they are few and far between.  We have had some sensible proposals from the Labour Party, but they just do not work or might be more expensive.  At least they went some way to help.  However, even the Labour Party was prone, on occasion, to accuse us of bailing out builders and developers.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">Let us bail out the economy.  Let us look after the ordinary people and get off that record.  Let us have more developers, like Zoe Developments, in court.  If they cannot pay their bills, that is where they should end up.  That is a good template for NAMA, rather than what was suggested by <i>The Irish Times</i> and other political entities.  The suggestion was that somehow this court case was designed to help NAMA and that the refusal of examinership was a disaster for NAMA.  Refusal of examinership in a case like that is exactly what NAMA should be about.  If there is no hope for the company, the Government must step in where the banks have failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">Let us look at the money that will come from NAMA.  We can have all the guarantees or rules we like about banks lending out money, but if they have not got the cash there is not much we can do about it.  NAMA will give banks the cash and the Minister can put in stricter requirements with regard to lending the money to the wider economy — to people who can repay their loans.  We must not forget when talking about lending money that the problem we have is as a result of lending too much money.  Therefore, we want to lend money in the proper circumstances.  I heard Deputy Kenny remark one day that needy families required credit.  Needy families do not require credit.  They require jobs and hope, but not credit.  There is too much credit in the economy for families.  Businesses require credit.  I have full faith and support in NAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">I am also astounded by the latest Fine Gael press release on NAMA, which criticises the 80% rezoning tax.  While the IFA must represent its members' interests, it has more to be doing than criticising this 80% tax.  This 80% tax is designed to get around the problem we have had whereby the small number of landowners gained at the expense of the many.  Fine Gael issued a press release on this today saying it supports people who have had land rezoned against having to pay an 80% tax.  Why, asks Fine Gael, should they have to pay an 80% tax?  They are the people Fine Gael has been complaining about who over the past ten years have gained the millions that were borrowed and are now the cause of our problems.  However, Fine Gael is now again supporting every interest group.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">How many farmers will be able to benefit from rezoned land?  In its latest statement on its website, Fine Gael shows this is what it is concerned about.  Very few farmers will be in a position to be worried about paying capital gains tax on the sale of rezoned land.  Let us worry about the real issues in the economy.  The 80% tax is not an issue.  I fully support it as do most of my colleagues.  It should not affect any one-off housing because such houses are rarely built on zoned land.  They are usually built on agricultural land.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Let us have a proper debate and let us talk about the approach to take.  Let us worry about the valuations.  We are all worried about the valuations.  It is a massive amount of money for anyone to spend on these loans.  We must get that message across.  It makes me angry every time I hear we are buying property or that NAMA will become the biggest property company in the world.  We are buying loans and many of them are good and will help pay for the running of NAMA.  Those good developers who are paying back their loans should be encouraged to promote further development, and employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">We are constantly saying we do not have enough construction employment and that is true.  There are too many people unemployed.  Any good developers who are paying back, contributing to society and looking at investment need to be encouraged, and that message has to go out, too.  However, the speculators or the "flippers" as they are often referred to, who unfortunately are hopeless cases, must be moved out of the system because they are blocking the construction industry and the wider economy.  That is the simple reality of the NAMA approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">I fully support it, but we are worried.  However, I should be more worried if we did nothing, because the situation at the moment is so dire.  While the international economy is moving on — and we are benefiting from that — the domestic economy is not.  NAMA needs to get the money into the economy.  Whatever mechanisms the Minister needs to put into the legislation to get that money into the economy, let him do that.  Get the money into the economy and the banks off our necks.  Close down Anglo Irish Bank as soon as possible, but let us not tell the wider world that we are going to default on our obligations.  That is the layman's banking solution and it is not one that can be recommended to a small country totally dependent on international trade.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_381">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_921">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to what is probably the most important debate ever to be heard in this House since the establishment of the State.  We in the Labour Party have proposed an alternative solution.  We then made the difficult decision to propose the temporary nationalisation of the banks.  However, the Government has chosen to nationalise the losses but privatise profits.  That is the clearest and most enduring difference between the proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">The banking crisis which had led to the proposals for NAMA that we are now considering has produced several debased phrases to disguise or excuse those who are to blame for the crisis. We are told that "we are where we are", which implies that we should not ask how we got here.  Every statement by the Minister for Finance ends with the phrase "going forward" which suggests that we should not look backward.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">We are where we are because of the irresponsibility of bankers and developers, the incompetence of the Financial Regulator and the unwillingness of the Government to heed the warnings of distinguished economists in time to avert the disaster we must now deal with.  In 2005 Professor Morgan Kelly wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> pointing out that the total lending of the Irish banks to property developers was greater than the value of the deposits in the banks, and that a collapse of the property bubble and possibly of the banks was almost inevitable.  He was immediately shouted down by Government spokesmen and by the Financial Regulator who assured us that the banks were well capitalised.  In view of the hopeless inadequacy of the “light touch regulation” implemented by the Regulator it is possible that he actually believed what he was saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance only very reluctantly and belatedly removed the plethora of tax incentives which fuelled the property bubble, although it had been clear from the mid 1990s that they were no longer needed.  The Minister seemed to believe that when the construction sector reached 13% of GDP, while the average for the rest of the EU was about 5%, that this was a cause for celebration rather than alarm.  When the global financial crisis broke in 2008 the irresponsibility of the Irish banks was brutally exposed.  As Warren Buffet has said we only discover when the tide goes out who is not wearing swimming togs and the global banking crisis of 2008 combined with the collapse of the property bubble has led to taxpayers having to bear the cost of rescuing the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">NAMA is the brainchild of Dr. Peter Bacon, former economic adviser to Mr. Bertie Ahern, former stockbroker and property developer and favourite economist of Fianna Fáil.  He was the author of the famous report on house prices ten years ago.  When implementing the recommendations of his first report displeased the property developers Dr. Bacon readily came up with alternative recommendations that were more to their liking.  He proposed that the State, or more accurately the taxpayer, take on the euphemistically entitled "impaired" loans and that with the cash provided by the State — or rather the bonds issued which the ECB will discount for cash — the banks will be able to get on with the business of lending money to business and so help to revive the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">There are several potential pitfalls in this plan which the proponents of NAMA seem to be ignoring.  Even at the height of the boom the banks were, as they always have been, reluctant to lend to start up businesses or even the expansion of existing businesses and there is no reason to assume that this will change post-NAMA.  Less than 60% of the lending by Irish banks was financed by deposits from the Irish public.  The rest was borrowed from overseas banks and investors and when this source dried up after the collapse of Lehmann Brothers, the Government was forced to guarantee the banks' liabilities and they had to turn to the ECB for funding.  Despite the Government guarantee, the banks are finding it difficult to raise money on international markets and are very likely to use the funds supplied by NAMA to reduce their foreign liabilities.  When loans are transferred to NAMA, the banks' assets will shrink and they are very likely to use the agency's funds to pay off some of their foreign liabilities.  This will result in healthier banks which will be good for bank shareholders, but may not lead to much expansion of credit for small business which is the backbone of the economy, as we very well know.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">I assume that the Minister for Finance is aware that the massive quantitative easing in the UK and the USA, which will have the same effect as NAMA will have on banks funding, and has not led to an expansion of credit.  I see no proposals in the Bill before us that will ensure that when NAMA is set up the banks will be induced or compelled to increase their lending to the productive sectors of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">In the past, Labour Party proposals for a third banking force were strongly resisted and even sneered at, by the main banks in particular, and even the State development banks, ACC and ICC were privatised — a very bad decision in my view.  The Government therefore has very little capacity to ensure that any bank lends to the productive sector of the economy.  I should like to see concrete measures incorporated in this legislation to ensure an adequate supply of credit to small and medium businesses.  There are 250,000 small and medium-sized businesses across the country employing some 750,000.  That is an important statistic, one that is real and impacts on the lives or real people.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The valuation of the NAMA loans has been the subject of much scepticism by economic commentators and has been referred to on numerous occasions in this Chamber today.  The Government considers the discount which it has secured is sufficient to recover the full value of the loans on the basis of only a 10% increase in property prices.  This may seem a very cautious provision, but there is a possibility that some of the development land acquired by NAMA may in fact be worth only its agricultural value, which itself has fallen significantly in the past year.  In some counties there is land zoned for housing to meet housing needs for the next 50 years.  NAMA will also acquire half-built housing estates in many areas where there is no demand for housing .and some of these houses may eventually have to be demolished.  If zoned land and unfinished housing constitute a substantial part of the assets that NAMA will acquire, the valuations may be wildly optimistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">NAMA also proposes to acquire performing loans which are meeting interest payments.  I cannot see how NAMA can pay less than the value of performing loans to the banks without facing legal challenges.  The management of the banks may be willing to accede to the acquisition of performing loans because of the scale of the Government's shareholding, but the bondholders are likely to resist as they stand to lose if NAMA buys bank assets at too low a price.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">As I understand it, the Government is prepared to accept a proposal which emanated from the new Governor of the Central Bank that NAMA pay a reduced value for the loans, but give the banks a share in any increase in their value which the agency can achieve.  The Government should give serious consideration to that proposal, in my view.  It is suggested that part of the payment to NAMA will be in the form of a bond whose value will depend on the rate of recovery achieved by the agency.  This provision would provide some return to the taxpayer, but the question arises as to how much the bonds will be worth.  If the market considers that significant amounts of NAMA assets are worthless, the bonds may be worth very little and the banks will not be able to regard them as assets which will not improve their funding position.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The Minister argues that NAMA will make a profit because when the loans are repaid or the security underlying them is realised, the proceeds will be greater than the original cost.  This prediction assumes that the long term economic value of the assets acquired by NAMA will be realised.  However, NAMA can only make a profit by paying less than the long term economic value — and so any profit it makes will be at the expense of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The setting up of NAMA involves the largest expenditure of public money on one project since the establishment of the State.  It also involves an enormous increase in Government debt at a time when people are being forced to accept higher taxes, lower public spending and cuts here, there and everywhere.  Let us not forget that the borrowing to fund NAMA will ultimately be repaid by the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">I was astonished to hear some Fianna Fáil Deputes state recently that NAMA will be funded by the European Central Bank.  The ECB will discount the bonds given to the banks by NAMA, but bonds are a form of borrowing that will ultimately have to be repaid — like all Government borrowing — from tax revenue.  Ministers have not actually misrepresented the reality of the bond issue, but are trying to give an impression that somehow we are getting a great deal from the ECB; or that the ECB has set the interest rate for the NAMA bonds; or that NAMA is somehow backed or approved by the ECB.  These assertions are wishful thinking.  The ECB will discount the bonds at the appropriate market rate and that rate is likely to rise, as many other countries are increasing their borrowing.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">Let us break down the figures for the cost of NAMA into numbers that are intelligible to everybody outside in the street, but do not seem to make sense to  the Minister for Finance and his advisers.  NAMA will impose a tax of €1,500 for every person in the State for the next 20 years.  Borrowing the money to fund NAMA will bring our national debt to €1.75 trillion which represents €1 million for every two workers in the country.  A small fraction of this borrowing would fund all of the capital needs of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">Let us be clear that rescuing the banks will mean that many children will continue to be taught in freezing prefabs with leaking roofs, we will continue to have a public transport system that is less effective than that of some third world countries, we will continue to have the highest pupil-teacher ratios in the world and every day people will languish on trolleys in our hospitals.  This is the impact it will have.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">NAMA represents an enormous transfer of public money into private hands, the hands of bank shareholders.  It is a grim example of what the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has called "socialism for the rich, markets for the poor".  We used to be constantly told that markets were all about risk-taking and that in a dynamic market economy, losses and business failures are inevitable.  I recall the chief economist of the Bank of Ireland, Dr. Dan McLaughlin, expressing a view in regard to the workers who were made redundant by Irish Continental Lines to be replaced by cheaper labour from poor countries.  Dr. McLaughlin's view was that free markets inevitably lead to such results but that markets are always right.  I am surprised that Dr. McLaughlin has not applied the same logic to Bank of Ireland shareholders, who, in his view, are clearly more worthy of State support than the ferry workers or many other workers throughout the country who are fighting their corner to try to secure a decent standard of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">We are repeatedly told that NAMA is the only game in town.  However, we have put forward an alternative and articulated the reasoning behind it, and it has received the support of some very eminent people.  Nonetheless, it is a game in which the dice are heavily loaded against the taxpayer.  In the USA, the troubled assets relief programme was originally based on the idea of overpaying for assets but Congress refused to sanction this approach and the programme is now based on equity investment in the banks, which will yield a return for the taxpayer.  While asset management agencies have been used in other countries to enable banks to offload bad loans and get on with lending for productive purposes, these agencies have paid realistic market values for the impaired loans, which minimises possible exposure and losses for the taxpayer.  The ECB, which will ultimately provide cash for the NAMA bonds, has recently stated that where assets are purchased, the price paid should be "mostly risk-based and determined by market conditions", in contrast to the Government's approach of deliberately paying more than market values.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">The experience of previous asset management agencies shows that when the assets transferred to the agencies have been a large fraction of total bank assets, the agencies have struggled to succeed.  While the assets likely to be transferred from Bank of Ireland are not large in total, those transferred from AIB represent a significant sum.  In the case of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, they would have collapsed a year ago had the Government not introduced the guarantee.  It was argued at the time that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide were of "systemic importance" and that winding them up would have had negative effects on the whole banking system.  I am not convinced this was the case.  While the depositors in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide were protected, the bondholders who lent to these very risky institutions should have been made bear at least some of the consequences of their irresponsible lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">As the Minister for Finance would reply, however, we are where we are.  What must now be done is to ensure that NAMA operates at the least cost to the taxpayer and, if possible, provides some return to the taxpayer for the enormous sums of public money that must be provided.  I understand the Green Party is seeking a social dividend from NAMA and I note that the Construction Industry Federation appear to be opposed to this.  The opposition was expressed most vehemently by the head of the CIF, Mr. Tom Parlon, former Minister of State for the Progressive Democrats, who were such cheerleaders for the unregulated free market that has greatly contributed to the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">If any good is to come out of this crisis, one element must be that the provision of vital social amenities should not result in huge profits for speculators, as it has done over the past decade.  We have seen the Minister for Education and Science having to pay huge sums of money for primary school sites to developers when the planning permission made no provision for social amenities.  We have seen housing estates built without even adequate footpaths, much less any amenities that would make them tolerable places to live.  All of this is the result of Fianna Fáil policy which has always put the interests of property speculators over the interests of the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">The provisions of the Kenny report on building land prices of nearly 30 years ago are being dusted down and reconsidered.  Every time the Labour Party sought the implementation of the Kenny report, we were told that it would violate the Constitution, although leading experts on the Constitution were convinced it would not.  Had the report been implemented, not only would we not have had the current crisis but we might not have had the problems revealed by the Flood and Mahon tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">NAMA must end definitively the notion that housing is a speculative asset rather than a basic social need.  The debased approach to housing has left us with 50,000 people on local authority waiting lists while in every town and many villages we have thousands of unsold houses, the weeds growing through their windows, whose builders await rescue by NAMA.  If NAMA is to have the support of the taxpayers who fund it, it must ensure a social dividend for the wider community commensurate with the enormous sum of taxpayers' money necessary to fund it.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">What has been of great concern to me and many people we encounter on the streets or at our clinics revolves around the significant and increasing cohort of people, especially young people, who paid exorbitant and unsustainable prices for their houses, and who now find themselves unable to meet their huge loan commitments and, increasingly, find themselves in the zone of negative equity.  People retort that no form of NAMA has been put in place to deal with the dilemma that these people now find themselves in.  It would be a significant dereliction of the duty of this House if the banks were not required as part of the conditions for them receiving this unprecedented injection of taxpayers' cash to recognise the difficulties these young people are now in, and to devise appropriate measures and schemes of arrangement tailored so as to ensure that these people's homes will not be subject to repossession orders, and that the banks have a recognisable, defined obligation in this regard.  It would be some kick in the teeth to the taxpayers and the public to find that as soon as the President signs this Bill into law, we are treated to an orgy or frenzy of court applications for possessions because unfortunate people have defaulted upon their loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">The proposal of my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, for the establishment of a homes protection commission is an excellent one, which should be taken on board by the Minister.  During the course of my recent attendance at the national ploughing championships, I took the opportunity of speaking to many farmers and their representative organisations, which left me in no doubt as to their bewilderment and anger at the proposed 80% rate of capital gains tax on the gains arising from the disposal of rezoned land which the Government has indicated it intends to introduce on Committee Stage of this Bill.  Notwithstanding the draconian nature and rate of this tax, surely it is a case of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted.  It should have been introduced much earlier because the level or frequency of windfall gains are unlikely to figure much on the landscape in the future, and the level of any such contemplated disposals are likely to be postponed or discouraged completely.  Therefore, the level of income the Government will derive from such a source will be negligible.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">Section 155 of the Bill is also causing considerable angst among the farming public.  One can appreciate that their concerns are well-founded in so far as it empowers NAMA to acquire land by CPO in order to maximise the value of properties which it would already have on its books.  Such lands must be acquired by agreement and, of course, the acquisition must be deemed necessary, but the key question is what acquisitions will be defined as "necessary".  The Minister should consider these aspects of the legislation carefully before proceeding to embed these concepts in statute law as they constitute gross unfairness and are based upon the anvil of discrimination.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_947">Both inside and outside the House, this is viewed as complex legislation.  The major representation being made to me in this regard is that nothing in the Bill provides for the tsunami that is coming down the track in regard to the repossession of people's homes — their kingdoms.  It is this concern I wish to highlight.  After reviewing the views of Deputies from across the House, the Minister must include in the legislation a mechanism to protect the family home.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">At present, the HSE through the community welfare system is paying mortgage interest relief to 16,000 families, the number having risen from 4,000 or by four times in the past 12 to 14 months.  This is only an interim payment so it is plain that the family home is under threat in all of these cases.  The ESRI in a recent working paper by David Duffy stated that the price of houses was continuing to drop and that almost 150,000 homeowners would be in negative equity by the end of 2010.  With the continued rise in unemployment and related problems, it is clear that many families are using HSE payments and the generosity of parents and friends as well as borrowing beyond their needs from moneylenders and the like to try to ensure their homes are protected.  Yet, there is nothing in the Bill to ensure, nor have I heard it from the institutions, that the banks will provide a mechanism which will ensure the family home is protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">Many believe that when this legislation is completed, the banks will be waiting like wolves on the hill for the scent to move in the right direction and when that happens we will see countless repossessions.  Last Friday was probably the worst ever day I experienced as a public representative since I came to these Houses in 1992.  Five people who came to my clinic had received eviction orders.  I had to face them, try to console them and give them some hope as to how we could help them.  Not one line in the legislation offers any hope or solace for such families.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has continuously stated that a mortgage management agency structure must be either incorporated into the legislation or introduced as separate legislation.  Reference has been made to approximately 150,000 people who will be in negative equity.  According to David Duffy the most likely people to default among them are those who are ill, unemployed or in poor financial circumstances and they will risk losing their homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, has similar constituents in his area.  Rural Deputies are aware of many people who have come from cities to rural areas to purchase properties at a cheaper price but due to the rise in unemployment their financial circumstances have deteriorated.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to bring the need for such a provision to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  The Bill must be modified to incorporate such a change or alternative legislation must be drawn up in tandem with the NAMA Bill to ensure there is protection for the family and society.  If not, the future of this country will be dark, as most of the houses in communities will be repossessed because the unfortunate families do not have the money to pay their mortgage.  I hope that change will be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">I look to the good side of the Government, such as the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, and others I know who are honourable and who know in their heart and soul what are the problems.  I hope that provision will be introduced by the Minister for Finance before the conclusion of Second Stage to ensure that families can rest in their beds at night and not fear a knock on the door the following morning from someone saying the keys to their house will be taken from them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan</from>
          <p eId="para_953">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on the NAMA Bill.  It is one of the most important pieces of legislation to go before the House for a generation and perhaps even since the foundation of the State.  Over the years I have heard one particular man recount the experiences of his family and others around the world after the 1929 Wall Street crash.  The economic and financial crisis we are facing is similar to that.  The decisions we take as Members of the Oireachtas in the coming weeks and months will be crucial to the type of society we create and regulate in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">In the past 12 months since the bank guarantee scheme was put in place to stabilise the banking system and prevent a withdrawal in funding we have heard discussions in this House and on the airwaves about the decisions taken by the regulatory system that was in place for the financial institutions and how that system did not work.  The amount of money that was pumped into the economy has left us with a huge crisis to face.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">We can learn two lessons from what happened.  The first is that the principles-based regulation system did not work and it will not work in the future.  The regulatory framework we must put in place has to ensure that the credit bubble that developed will never occur again.  Much economic activity was built on credit and many people are now experiencing a lack of credit availability.  We went from having a large amount of credit to zero credit.  Successful and profitable businesses are starved of financial resources due to the dysfunctional banking system.  The National Asset Management Agency legislation we are dealing with is an attempt to address the issue.  The Minister is working on further drafts to the legislation.  It is crucially important that we get the bad loans out of the system and get credit flowing again to restart the economy.  First, we must ensure that once NAMA is in place and the bank balances are cleaned up that the credit made available is reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">We must also examine the type of society we were creating in recent years.  Policy decisions that were taken in the Anglo-Saxon world, especially in the United States and Great Britain, in recent years have had disastrous results.  It is time for us to reconsider the type of society we wish to create, not alone in terms of the Bill before us but in the context of all the other issues we must face.  Following the Great Depression in the 1930s some commentators considered that American industry did not recover until the onset of the Second World War.  That recession spread to the southern hemisphere also.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">Decisions were taken at that time by those in power on protectionism in our case and other policies to be pursued.  We must take a fundamental look at how we go forward.  In recent years we devised a spatial strategy with hub towns in the regions.  The policy was to drive the majority of the population into the major urban centres and to create a critical mass, whatever that means.  It can stand for a vast amount of things.  We have taken our eye off the ball.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">Let us consider the issues that face NAMA.  The loans that will be of predominant interest to it are in the main based in the major centres of population where greenfield and brownfield sites were sold for vast amounts of money.  Nobody in this House would have even contemplated the ridiculous amounts of money that were paid for such sites.  Some people in rural areas say the Celtic tiger never reached them in terms of the frenzy of land and property purchase.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">We must examine every aspect of our policies for the future.  Much policy has been driven by interest groups outside of this House, some of which are statutory groups or for one reason or another are funded by the Government or Government agencies.  I do not just refer to the fabric of society we wish to create but to whether we want society to be predominantly based in urban or rural areas.  We have many decisions to make on NAMA, the banking system and its flaws.  The loans it will buy will predominantly relate to property in the major urban centres.  There must be a more balanced regional approach to development and we must seriously examine the type of society we want and the type of country we wish to leave after us.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">We must examine our planning policy.  We have seen what happened in parts of the United States and the United Kingdom after the development of huge urban centres in the 1960s and 1970s.  We did it in this country too in some of our cities by creating huge housing estates without any amenities.  Forty years later our society is paying an enormous price through social breakdown, policing and the violence in west Dublin and other parts of the country.  The policy was to continue building.  We must examine that.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">On the legislation, we must learn things from the last 12 months.  People and particularly public representatives have often heard young people talking about seeking loans or credit from financial institutions.  They might hear that a particular bank manager was very strict and would not give the loan unless the person had made proper calculations of the principal earner's salary, half the second earner's salary and so forth.  However, other banks were giving money out much faster.  There followed a race to the bottom.  The critical issue was the way the banks loaned the money.  Bonuses were paid by the banks on the amount of money being loaned.  Every week it was totted up and the banks showed a profit on paper.  There was never an issue about a person on a small salary who was being loaned ten or 20 times his salary and how he would pay it back, even if the mortgage or loan was over 25, 35 or 45 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">People are coming to our clinics about their homes being repossessed and mortgages they took out for 40 or 45 years from some of the sub-prime lenders and the operators who were giving cheaper and more easily available credit than the main banks and institutions.  We must learn the deep and expensive lesson from this financial crisis.  A generation of people learned from the financial crisis of 1929 and the 1930s.  Regulation was put in place to ensure it could never happen again but, 70 years later, the greed of the human being and the eye for accumulating more and more profit was everywhere.  We must be true to ourselves and in ordering society for the future we must ensure the financial regulatory system we put in place will be draconian.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">The difficulty was that when we joined the eurozone we experienced a low interest rate economy for the first time.  Our interest rates were no longer tied to sterling.  We were tied to the European Central Bank and would have a low interest rate economy.  If there had not been the mindless borrowing and lending that was permitted by the banks and financial institutions, we would have been better off.  We must ensure the draconian legislation that is necessary is put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">All Members who have contributed to this debate on NAMA have spoken about the need to get more credit into the economy and to small and medium sized businesses.  Small and medium sized businesses are suffering due to the lack of credit, as are farmers.  Cattle prices are suffering because credit is not available for the stocking loans that are usually available in the autumn over a six or nine month period.  There is a crisis in that sector and throughout the economy due to the lack of available credit.  However, we must ensure when we are dealing with this issue and the amount of credit we can put into the system that it is credible credit and that the fundamental rules of allowing credit into any economy or society are followed.  They may seem draconian towards what they were formerly but they will have to be steady and solid.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">One feels that many of the contributions made in this House over the years are being ignored because powers outside the House do not give due recognition to us as legislators and people.  The Members of this Parliament are probably closer to their constituents than the Members of most other European parliaments because of the proportional representation system and the ethos of serving the people through the system we have.  It is a great system because we bring into it the knowledge and experience we encounter in our clinics and constituency offices, as well as the huge difficulties people are experiencing on a daily basis.  In return, we must ensure good legislation is put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Many people have worries about NAMA but the fundamental basis of any economy is a sound banking system.  In September 2008 the bank guarantee scheme was put in place by the Government because there was unease throughout the western and particularly the Anglo-Saxon world about the banking system, after the collapse of the major American bank Lehman Brothers.  Banks were affected throughout the world.  We had to put that scheme in place.  People might ask why we did not allow the banks to go to the wall.  If they went to the wall, they would bring far more with them, such as the insurance industry and other, smaller financial institutions that depend on it.  It is important to convey that it is for the underlying benefit of the Irish economy that we get this legislation working, the banking system back in order and force through solid and genuine regulation that is checked on an ongoing basis by the Members of the Oireachtas, who are answerable to the people.  As has been seen with other agencies and bodies throughout the public sector, there must be accountability to this House and therefore to the public and the people who elect us.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">There have been comments about the European Central Bank.  The European Central Bank resulted from the various treaties and the common currency negotiations many years ago.  Without the European Central Bank and the facilities it has made available to us over the last year, we would be in a far more difficult position.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">There is one issue regarding NAMA of which the Minister and Government are very conscious, the correct price to pay for these loans.  Some of the loans will not have deteriorated too much in value, while some of them are worthless.  There are loans based on land prices in areas where the land will never be anything but agricultural land.  In some places the land is beyond being agricultural land.  We must be very conscious that the price being paid for these loans is recognition of what they will be worth into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">The legislation is complex and detailed.  It has been given huge consideration by the Government, and the Minister for Finance and the Government are working very hard on other aspects of the legislation.  I believe it is the right thing to do at this time.  It is an important step in trying to get our economy back on track and to ensure that there is a credible credit system in this country.  However, in tandem with this and other legislation we must decide on the type of society we will have.  We must examine the fundamental elements of society. Over the past 30 to 40 years, the focus of society has gravitated towards large urban centres, sometimes with disastrous consequences.  For example, many towns and cities have experienced a problem with ghettoisation, an issue that must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">The national spatial strategy, with its focus on hub towns, has not been properly implemented to ensure the benefits are spread across the country, including the most rural of areas.  Some rural schools are under pressure for numbers owing to building.  We should work to ensure facilities are provided in smaller towns and villages, around which society must be built.  Rural areas do not experience the difficulties associated with larger towns because their populations are spread more widely.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">This complex and detailed legislation has been examined by the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, both of which regard it as the way forward, as have other experts.  We must ensure amendments to the Bill reflect the ideas of Members of the Houses.  We are ultimately responsible to the people who send us here and must do our best to represent their views.  I commend the legislation to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_384">
          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_972">This is an important debate given that the legislation provides a basis for making a wrong decision and failing to kick-start the economy.  The backdrop to the legislation is the decision made one year ago to provide a State guarantee to the banks.  The guarantee provides protection for all three types of bank creditor, namely, normal depositors, interbank lending and high-risk bond holders.  It was provided initially as a stop-gap measure to ensure the banking system did not collapse and based on an expectation that money would begin to flow into the economy again.  Regrettably, the banks have failed to honour their commitments over the past 12 months.  Recovery has been slow, the level of credit provided in the economy has been minimal and company closures, job losses and trading difficulties have increased.  Cash flow, the life blood of any business, has completely dried up.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">The establishment of the National Asset Management Agency is intended to ensure an orderly economic recovery.  Under the NAMA process, the books of five banks and the State-owned Anglo Irish Bank have been opened to reveal a frightening picture of development loans.  The loans of 2,000 customers, 25,000 loans in total, will potentially be transferred to the new agency.  The loan book to be transferred is valued at €77 billion, including €9 billion of unpaid interest.  Unpaid interest of this scale suggests there was a problem even when property values were high and loans could have been sold at high prices.  The problem has clearly been around for a long time, although the Taoiseach, a former Minister for Finance, insists he was not aware of a crisis until one year ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">Only 40% of the property loans to be transferred to NAMA are performing.  While it is not clear to what level they are performing, they are described as "toxic" loans for a reason.  This also means that 60% of the loans are not performing.  The asset valuation of these loans is €88 billion.  While developers are required to put up some of their own money when taking out loans, I doubt this was the case.  A 47% reduction in values has been assumed, giving the loans a valuation of €47 billion.  The Government has decided to pay €54 billion for these loans or approximately €13,500 for every man, woman and child in the country.  If a problem arises, it will be extremely costly.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The valuation process is problematic.  If, for example, the companies owned by Liam Carroll are even remotely representative, the reduction in values is more likely to be 80%, rather than the Government's estimate of less than 50%.  In addition, land values are subject to variation and are not based solely on supply and demand but also on zoning.  A further problem arises if the developers did not put up cash as collateral.  I doubt very much this was the case.  Another concern regarding NAMA is that it is premised on future values.  The Minister failed to take into account the likelihood of future interest rate and inflation rate increases.  Those who lend money expect more than to break even after ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">While I accept the necessity to save the banking system, must we save the five Irish institutions as private banks?  Should we have provided guarantees to all bank creditors?  The Fine Gael Party policy is to establish a State bank which would provide seed capital, which would ensure many businesses with the potential to develop succeed.  Anglo Irish Bank, which will receive State support of €28 billion, will not lend one euro to any business.  Having received €3.5 billion from the State, the bank is seeking further moneys to underpin its accounts and wants to have its toxic debts removed.  We should instead make billions available to a stand-alone bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">A State-owned bank sold to the Bank of Scotland in the 1990s was highly effective in previous recessions when it invested in stand-alone projects in every town and village.  It is regrettable that the Government has not decided to establish a new bank with a clear mandate to invest in job creation.  Small companies across the country are finding it impossible to secure working capital.  Today, my party leader, Deputy Kenny, asked what assurances the banks had given that they will re-invest in small companies.  Banks will give one ten reasons not to give money and not a single reason to provide it.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">The Bill is specific on the establishment and operation of the National Asset Management Agency and about the arrangements for transferring vast amounts of money into the accounts of participating banks.  However, it is weak on issues such as transparency and it is silent on the issue of restructuring.  The word "ethics" makes a brief walk-on, walk-off appearance in the legislation.  A significant element of the NAMA project reminds me of a phrase used in a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale — "Meanwhile, in another part of the forest...."</p>
          <p eId="para_979">To find out about Government intentions under many other related headings, we are referred to ministerial statements.  This is not good enough.  Let us take the issue of ethics as a case in point.  Section 30 refers to disclosure of interests by members of the board of the National Asset Management Agency and provides that the board shall issue guidelines as to what constitutes an interest for the purpose of the section, having regard to the definitions of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995.  This is the only reference to ethics in the entire Bill.  Let us contrast the ethical arrangements and standards built into the legislation with those built into the Local Government Act 2001.  Part 15 of the 2001 Act provides for a comprehensive ethical framework for local government services.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_385">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_980">I thank Deputy Shortall and the Labour Party for proposing the motion, which the Fine Gael Party is pleased to support without equivocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">This is a relevant time to discuss FÁS.  We have 12.6% unemployment, the third highest in the euro zone behind Belgium and Spain, and there are currently 440,000 people on the live register.  While all of us have had a lot to think about this week, in terms of how this House works and the way we run our own operations, we have a great deal to do to change things before people will take us seriously or accept the kind of measures that will be necessary to save this country from the abyss.  We should not forget that the overriding issue now facing our country is unemployment and the many more who will continue to lose their jobs as the country remains uncompetitive and fails to take the measures, painful though they may be, which are necessary to restore the country's economy to health.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">I should note that FÁS does good work across the country.  It is important to acknowledge that.  I say it in every interview I do on FÁS — it rarely gets picked up by the media but I would like to again put that on the record.  The majority of ordinary FÁS staff do a very good job.  During the Lisbon treaty campaign I had the opportunity to meet many of them and while some of them, and Deputies Shortall, Allen and others, were angry with me for highlighting this issue, the majority were glad that the FÁS scandal had been aired and they now rely on us to ensure it is restructured and that its corporate culture changes, whether it is the executive at the top or the bullying and intimidation throughout the organisation by people largely associated with the Government parties seeking preferment for their constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">The FÁS scandal has been ongoing for more than a year.  It started with anonymous letters, which were initially sent to the Minister, Deputy Harney and were subsequently sent to us, and audit reports which we were able to release to the media.  It is important to note that we had great difficulty initially getting that information into the media.  I will keep the details for my memoirs, but needless to say one major news company refused to carry the story.  I was not surprised when I learned that many journalists were wined and dined, flown first class by FÁS around the world and accommodated.  We found out how much money FÁS spent, totally inappropriately, on advertising in a large number of media organisations.  The people who spent that money were not just wasting taxpayers' money, they knew exactly what they were doing.  They were buying the silence of the Fourth Estate, that is, the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">In many ways Ministers have not behaved very differently in the preferential treatment they have given to journalists on their ministerial travel over the years.  I am glad that silence has now ended and that we can see a real clean-out of this country, starting in the Dáil, moving on to our media and other establishments and all the way down the line to the hundreds of thousands of people in this country who receive tax-funded unvouched expenses, allowances, tax exemptions and other benefits.  We now have a great opportunity to clean up this country and turn it into a much better place.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">I raised this issue in the Dáil in May 2008 and the Tánaiste's response was that FÁS had clarified its procedures and strengthened its controls and she wanted to know no more about it.  Deputy Kenny raised the matter in July 2008.  The Taoiseach told us he had the highest regard for Rody Molloy, that he could depend on him at all times and that he would defend him at all times.  Subsequently there were revelations in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>  by Nick Webb and Senator Shane Ross.  The matter was then investigated by the Committee of Public Accounts.  We then had a Dáil debate on it and had a series of reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">The Tánaiste's attitude to this matter was the same throughout.  I do not blame her for FÁS.  I do not think she was responsible for the things that went on there.  I blame her less than I do her two predecessors, the Minister, Deputy Harney and the Minister, Deputy Martin, but her approach to FÁS was always very clear.  This was a bad news story she just wanted to go away and she was prepared to pay any money to make it go away, whether it was pension top-ups, bonuses or a free car.  She wanted the story to go away so she could spend her time doing what she wants to do, which is travelling around the country, opening offices and so on.  That has been her approach to this issue throughout.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">Her approach to the board was similar.  First she backed it, then she said she would accept resignations and in between there was some suggestion of a press release supporting its members.  We also had the issue of FÁS executives, the people who are most responsible for this and who have largely escaped unscathed.  They include people like Greg Craig, a former Fianna Fáil candidate and employee of former Fianna Fáil members of the parliamentary party and someone who received the support of the trade union movement in retaining his job.  The extent of the complicity of what has gone on in FÁS is shocking and shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">We now have a new board and CEO, but what is missing is political direction and real policy on the sort of training agency we want to have in the future.  That must be the most important thing because we need to move on from this scandal and all the other scandals in this country and start to reshape our democracy, public sector and State bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">The regional directorate of FÁS corporate on Baggot Street and all that is associated with it costs €150 million a year to fund and most of that does not need to continue.  The employment programmes and community employment schemes cost €430 million a year, and they should continue.  They are not effective labour market measures.  They have an important social role and are now more important than ever, but the appropriate role for such programmes is local government and not a State bureaucracy.  The apprenticeships and training integration cost €108 million a year.  In many ways our apprenticeship system is the model for apprenticeships in the world and should remain in place, either in a new FÁS or as part of the broader education sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">Training for people in employment costs €122 million a year and I have serious concerns about the way that money is spent and is farmed out to organisations which had representatives on the boards.  We need to examine this issue from scratch, probably using the skillnets model as the more effective way of training people in employment.  That is not to say everything in skillnets is perfect but the model is a good one.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">Some €248 million is spent on training for employment.  There are courses of various quality but the key issue is to provide people with the kind of training they need and not the kind we think they need or that FÁS happens to make available.  Perhaps the best way of using that €248 million, which is a lot of money in any one year, is to give people who have been made redundant that money as a voucher which they could then use to get the kind of training they need.  If graduates, that may mean going to a higher level institution and doing a masters degree or a PhD.  It may mean going to a VEC or to an institution of further education and acquiring the training they need there.  We need a model for the delivery of training, with the money going to the person who requires the training or is being made redundant.  We should not expect people who have been made redundant to fit into the systems we create for them, what FÁS happens to make available for them or for what they happen to qualify or be eligible.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">We also need to have a one stop shop for the unemployed.  I do not understand why a person must go to the Department of Social and Family Affairs to get their welfare payments and is then sent to the LES, FÁS or a different partnership, depending on the case.  We need to have a simple, straightforward one stop shop for people who are unemployed so they can claim their benefits and enter training straight away.  We also need to integrate FÁS with our social welfare system.  We need to examine models such as those in Denmark, Holland and other countries which have flexible social welfare systems, where welfare payments are more generous than they are here but are also highly conditional on people agreeing to participate in training and community service.  There is a major opportunity to integrate FÁS and the entire welfare system.  We should start, in terms of remodelling the system, with those under 25 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">I again thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion.  I support it.  I thank the members of the Committee of Public Accounts for their role in this.  I express my disgust at the Government, Fianna Fáil, the executives in FÁS, who shamelessly continue to hold their jobs, and those in the media who received hospitality from FÁS and continued to write well of it and ill of members of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This scandal will go on and on.  There is much more to come, and if I could verify and prove it I could put it in the public domain.  We must move on from it, rebuild FÁS and remodel the way training and employment works in this country.</p>

          <from>Deputy Margaret Conlon</from>
          <p eId="para_996">I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this evening's debate.  The shocking absence of financial control within FÁS, as set out in a recent report, is disgraceful and utterly unacceptable to the Irish people.  It is necessary for the Tánaiste to get to the root of the problem and to ensure this type of activity will not be repeated.  She is working and will continue to work hard to that end.  Many processes and systems are being put in place.  Certain officials within FÁS blew part of that organisation's huge budget.  It beggars belief that a car can go missing.  How can a company spend hundreds of thousands of euro on an advertisement without bothering to run it?  In any business, all moneys that are spent have to be fully accounted for.  In this case, however, there was a totally immoral process of waste.  I was happy to learn this week that the Garda investigation into this matter is bearing fruit.  I expect that to continue.  I hold no brief for anyone who is involved in wrongdoing.  I will never condone it.  The actions of Mr. Rody Molloy were wrong, abhorrent and immoral.  He should do the right and honourable thing by repaying the moneys to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">I concur with many elements of the Private Members' motion that has been tabled.  I would like some of them to be introduced.  There is a need for revised guidelines and severance packages for people who leave the public service.  I am confident that the Minister for Finance will introduce these necessary amendments.  As we have said on many occasions, December's budget will be one of the toughest of all time.  I agree with Deputy Varadkar that the Members of the Oireachtas have to be seen to do our bit and to lead by example.  The forthcoming budget gives the Minister an ideal opportunity to radically and thoroughly assess all expenses, packages and forms of remuneration.  The real victims of this waste are this country's many unemployed people who hope to avail of the upskilling and reskilling services provided by FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">I commend the many thousands of excellent FÁS staff whose morale has been affected by this affair.  I empathise with them as they see their organisation dragged through the media on a daily basis and as each of them are tarred with the same brush.  It is sordid that the unregulated media can attack people from every angle in the hope that their sales figures will increase for one day.  One's belief in why one is doing something can diminish in such circumstances.  It is unfair and unwarranted that FÁS's good and decent workers have become demoralised.  Greater accountability and transparency are needed in FÁS, just as they are in the Oireachtas.  I urge the Minister for Finance to put in place a system in which all expenses are vouched.  While it might not lead to huge savings, it will give every citizen of this country facts about what taxpayers' money is being spent on  That is the least we should be providing.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">In addition to providing for greater accountability within FÁS, we need to improve the governance provided by its board and strengthen the organisation's answerability to this House.  The decision to reduce the size of the board from 17 to 11 and to change its composition represents a huge step in restoring public confidence.  If FÁS is to focus on its training and employment mandate, it needs to enjoy total respect.  The Government is committed to continuing to offer those who have lost their jobs the assistance they need.  Training and education have never been more important for everyone in the workforce than they are in the current tough employment climate.  We must assist individuals by providing education and training opportunities.  The Tánaiste has been working to double the number of activation, training and work experience places.  The superb staff of FÁS are working hard on behalf of those who have lost their jobs.  As morale is low, we must build it back up.  Those who provide the front-line service can make or break the opportunities that are offered to unemployed people.  The reform of FÁS is necessary if we are to restore the confidence of the public in the organisation.  As politicians, we have a duty to reform our systems so that the confidence of citizens in the Oireachtas is restored in advance of the many difficult decisions that will be taken in the near future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnCreganFF" eId="spk_389">
          <from>Deputy John Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_1000">Like my colleagues, I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this important debate.  I welcome and support the amendment that has been submitted by the Tánaiste.  Deputy Varadkar said that when he raised this issue in the Dáil in May 2008, the Tánaiste did not want to know about it.  That is not true.  I am being kind when I use the word "untrue".  I will refer to the various actions that have been taken by the Tánaiste since May 2008, when it became evident, following the publication of an internal report by FÁS and a special report by the Comptroller and Auditor General, that difficulties were emerging within the organisation.  Following the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Tánaiste took immediate steps to deal with the problems that had been identified.  She met the chairman and director general of FÁS in June 2008 to seek assurances that the issues raised in the special report were being addressed.  She emphasised the importance of FÁS securing value for money in its expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, like all members of Fianna Fáil and the Government as a whole, want taxpayers' money to be properly, wisely and prudently spent.  It is wrong for Opposition Deputies to claim the higher moral ground, as if they want certain standards but we do not.  That is not the case.  It is important to nail that lie.  The Tánaiste asked the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to write to the then director general of FÁS to request a comprehensive report setting out the measures the organisation had taken to tighten its internal controls and prevent a recurrence of the practices raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The then director general responded in writing on 1 July 2008, setting out in detail the remedial actions taken in addressing the concerns of the Tánaiste and her Department.  When further issues came to light in September 2008, the Tánaiste once more asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to consider them.  She demanded an examination and an investigation of the irregularities and wrongdoing that were becoming evident and called for a further report to be prepared.  I am glad this was done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">The Tánaiste acted quickly and in the best interests of the taxpayers of this country at all times.  I commend her on that and acknowledge the effort she made during a very difficult period for FÁS.  We have to acknowledge the fantastic work that is being done at all levels, with the exception of corporate governance, within FÁS.  As we make representations on behalf of our constituents each day, we see the fantastic benefits FÁS can bring, predominantly in its retraining and upskilling role.  It does all of that work in an absolutely brilliant fashion.  I accept that mistakes were made.  When the Tánaiste puts in place new practices in FÁS, and other Ministers draw up similar regulations and practices, with the best will in the world they still have to depend on people who are in a position of trust.  I refer to people who are being paid by the country's taxpayers to show personal responsibility.  I regret to say that in the absence of such responsibility, neither the Tánaiste nor anyone else can stop wrongdoing like that associated with FÁS.  There will always be wrongdoing.  We have seen it before and I am sure we will see it again.  Certain people do not live up to their personal responsibilities when they are placed in a position of trust.  The blame for many of this country's scandals has been laid at the door of Ministers.  I accept that the buck stops with the Government.  The majority of such scandals were caused by people who lacked a sense of personal responsibility.  They were put in positions of trust, but they showed scant regard for it and squandered taxpayers' money.  That should never happen, but it has happened and it will happen again.  All the Tánaiste or anyone else can do is ensure that we examine what went on, put it right and implement improved practices.  We hope those who will be entrusted with positions of great responsibility in this country in the future will live up to those responsibilities.  We should get value for taxpayers' money, which should be spent wisely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">I am pleased to have had an opportunity to speak on this important amendment.  I commend the Tánaiste and wish her well.  I am sure she will see this out and we will see the right result for FÁS.  I wish FÁS well in the future.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
          <p eId="para_1004">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I was Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs when the difficulties we are discussing first came to our attention.  The Tánaiste at all times acted with the utmost probity and was conscious of the need to address the problems as they unfolded.  Factually incorrect assertions have been made that she did not act on time or in good faith.  On foot of receiving a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General in June 2008, she acted immediately to ask the then director general of FÁS to put in place appropriate procedures.  That was the first indication difficulties had arisen in FÁS.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report pointed out deficiencies in the area of corporate affairs and auditing.  Further revelations subsequently came to light regarding travel expenses and the science challenge programme and, again, the Tánaiste responded quickly and effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">People seem to have forgotten that the Committee of Public Accounts had already started an investigation when the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is an independent official with a statutory responsibility for ensuring public funds are not misappropriated, agreed to a request by the Tánaiste for further investigation of the issues that had arisen.  The Comptroller and Auditor General agreed to investigate after the Committee of Public Accounts reached its conclusions in October and November 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">It is accepted that an abuse of public funds took place and that money was spent in an unacceptable and wasteful manner but it is incorrect to suggest that the Tánaiste was unaware of the gravity of the matter.  From the moment these issues came to light, she acted at all times in the best interests of the taxpayer and FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">The Committee of Public Accounts has held further investigations and the Comptroller and Auditor General has made his report.  The Tánaiste has gone beyond several of the recommendations they made on establishing a new board and introducing amending legislation.  Allegations of cronyism have been shouted across the floor of the House.  If the Deputies making these allegations had the wit to study the Labour Services Act 1987, they would understand how the board is appointed.  It is for nominating bodies and not the Minister of the day to propose the members of the board.</p>

          <p eId="para_1011">The Deputy should read the legislation because it clearly sets out how to the board is to be appointed.  It is incorrect to suggest that nominating bodies are putting forward cronies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">A serious allegation was made last night to the effect that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance were acting outside the law but I subsequently clarified the issues surrounding the legality of the severance payment for the former director general of FÁS, Mr. Rody Molloy.  The statutory basis for the payment arrangement is section 6(3) of the Labour Services Act 1987.  I draw attention to the fact that sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act 1963 pertain solely to civil servants.  We accept that breaches of fundamental trust and abuses of taxpayer money took place but it is wrong to suggest that FÁS was an organisation of cronies or that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance acted outside the law in the context of removing the director general of FÁS.  The Tánaiste acted as quickly as possible to address the difficulties but the people concerned also have rights and entitlements.</p>

          <p eId="para_1013">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Tánaiste has been diligent in resolving the difficulties that have arisen in FÁS in the past 18 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">FÁS has been doing Trojan work through its community employment schemes, particularly in rural and disadvantaged communities, but it is being tarnished by what has happened in its upper echelons.  If run properly, it could be one of the best organisations in the country.  I note that the Tánaiste has introduced legislation to reform FÁS but every organisation which spends a cent of taxpayers' money must be made accountable to this House.  We are answerable to the public through elections and in turn we have to ensure taxpayers receive value for their money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">Even while questions were being asked about the use of funds by the upper echelons of FÁS, its staff were encountering difficulties in maintaining community employment schemes.  Deputies from all sides have sought additional places on these schemes over the years.  It is sickening that the funding we thought was being invested in training schemes was actually being spent on activities which had little or nothing to do with getting people back to employment.  Excellent work was being done on the ground by decent and genuine staff to help people with employment difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">We have to ensure we introduce legislation which provides accountability.  The Labour Services Act 1987 attempted to ensure that a variety of interests was represented on the board of FÁS but further accountability is required.  Politicians are blamed when anything goes wrong in the public sector but the difficulties which have arisen are not the result of misappropriation by any Member of these Houses.  If we have to take responsibility, we must also have accountability.  The legislation proposed by the Tánaiste will clean up the situation.  Excellent work is being done by FÁS but a few people have messed up the corporate sector for everybody else.  I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1017">I welcome the opportunity to address this Private Members' motion on the floor of the House tonight and also to commend the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, on her steps taken to deal with the unsatisfactory procedures of a small number of individuals involved in the training support agency, FÁS.  From a relatively early stage in her role as Minister, she set about investigating irregularities in the agency.  The Labour Party motion has highlighted all of the points that came out of investigations set in place by the Tánaiste.  We all know about the matters raised in the Private Members' motion tonight because the Tánaiste initiated investigations by the Comptroller and Auditor General which have resulted in two separate Garda investigations and one file with the DPP.  As the House will be aware, there has been a case before the courts during the week, and I believe we will see more.  Let us be clear about from where all of the investigations are emanating.  It is disingenuous of the Labour Party to give the impression that the Tánaiste sat on her hands and did nothing, which could not be further from the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">On the manner in which the director general was ousted from his position, it took courage to act the way the Tánaiste did.  This myth that she should have sacked him with no pension rights after 35 years of service goes against the Labour Party's own agendas on workers' rights.  The reality is that the only way of removing the director general of FÁS and saving the reputation of what is a relatively good agency was exactly how the Tánaiste did it, and the Opposition is cutting itself by saying otherwise.</p>

          <p eId="para_1020">If the Tánaiste acted in the manner suggested by the Opposition, the agency of FÁS would be on its knees currently.  Thanks to the brave decision making by the Tánaiste, this is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">There are three items on the wish list at the end of the Labour Party motion, namely to restructure the board of FÁS along the lines proposed in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, to refocus FÁS on its core work as the State training agency, capable of meeting the needs of those seeking employment, by providing relevant and high-quality training, and to ensure stringent accountability and oversight in respect of the spending of public moneys within both FÁS and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We all hold those aspirations and the reality is that the Tánaiste held them before any of us.  The gist of them, if they have not already taken place, are in the process of coming into being.  It is only fair that we deal with facts and truths in here rather than with myths.  It is not fair that we have knee-jerk reactions to much of what is going on in the media and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">In the current climate, the role of FÁS has never been more important.  I am particularly proud that the Tánaiste has protected the agency of FÁS.  It could have been lost as an agency if she had not acted as she did.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">There are many good people across this country working in FÁS where much good work takes place.  While there have been some irregularities, it is important to point out the good elements in FÁS over many years and in the organisation which preceded it, AnCO.  The agency has played an important role in our country's development over a long number of years and it is very much required now, in particular, to play a strong role in our road to recovery.  I, for one, am thankful that the agency will be there to take up the cudgel to provide training places for those who have lost their jobs in recent times and get them into a position where they can get employment in the near future.</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_399">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1024">It is with a heavy heart that I stand here this evening to speak on this Private Members' motion on what happened at FÁS.  I can remember a good many years ago when we started off with AnCO and then moved on to FÁS.  I mention the organisation's many schemes, such as the community employment schemes, the social economy schemes and community service programmes, its proud history and the valuable work that has been done in transforming our country's graveyards, playing fields, community services programmes, day care centres, community alert, visiting of the elderly and social services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">As a cathaoirleach of a community employment scheme employing five and an excellent supervisor in my parish, I must pay tribute to the many sponsor groups which had the initiative to seek these schemes out for a number of purposes to get their parishes and communities up and running and to take their proud place.  With regard to tidy towns and tidy villages, I would mention Emily in my county which won the tidy towns competition this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I also must praise the supervisors, who do an excellent job under all kinds of pressures from everybody, and of course the schemes' participants who otherwise would be on the dole queues and generate a significant tab which would have to be paid for by social welfare.  They have given of their time for little more than what they would earn on the dole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">I have taken issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, and with Deputy Quinn when he was the Minister visiting Tipperary years ago, on the question of enhancing these schemes.  The Minister of State and others were shocked by the number of participants we had in south Tipperary.  This was because we had committees — some of which were limited companies by guarantee to safeguard themselves but most of which were voluntary groups — set up which were willing to enable these schemes to take place and which helped all of the participants to take part, and undertook the onerous duties of employment legislation, workers rights and health and safety.  The voluntary boards did so much work, as did the participants and the supervisors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">A special thanks must go to the FÁS local officers.  I will mention a few here with whom I deal — Mr. Liam O'Brien in Tipperary, and Ms Catherine Corbett, Ms Mary O'Keeffe and Mr. Tom Murphy in Waterford — who are top-class officials in FÁS with impeccable records.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">We have annual audits carried out by accountants and every ha'penny is accounted for.  I remember a scheme where socks were provided with the safety boots and there was a considerable issue over why we provided those at a cost of a couple of euro.  Then one sees what happened at the top involving a small number where greed came into it and gave a bad name to everyone in FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">I wish the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the best of luck in trying to sort out the mess and in the restructuring of the board.  It is a pity this happened.  We have a long way to go and many corrections to make.  It is a scandal and such a shame for FÁS workers on the ground who are providing such valuable services.  The controversy is destroying the morale of the committees, the supervisors and the many hundreds, if not thousands, of good officials in FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">It is my strong belief that CE schemes and the other schemes must be broadened as they provide excellent services to communities.  FÁS must be refocused to concentrate on the services on the ground, cut out the waste at the top and pump the money into the local schemes, the jobs clubs and local training.  It needs to return to its roots and the purpose for which it was set up in the first place.  That is why I am calling for the re-establishment of FÁS from the top down to rebuild it and set it back to where it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, will be aware that a few months ago I raised an issue here which was a significant problem in my constituency, namely the closure of a jobs club in Carrick-on-Suir, which, as most Members will be aware, is an unemployment black spot.  The Carrick-on-Suir jobs club dealt with 850 clients per year in the past three years and placed approximately 100 persons in jobs or further training each year, and it was summarily dismissed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">Two members of staff who were employed with Carrick-on-Suir jobs club were made redundant when the jobs club closed down.  It so happened that this occurred the same week the famous Mr. Molloy resigned over controversy, and look what a pay-out he got.  These two staff members were not involved in any expenses controversy whatsoever.  Unlike Mr. Molloy, they did not receive a golden handshake.  In fact, up until today they have not received their statutory redundancy payments.  It is an outrage and a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">That is a clear example of what is going on in FÁS.  The top people made decisions to cut everything at bottom level while they were living it up.  This must be addressed.  FÁS must be re-established on a creditable basis.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_400">
          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_1035">I wish to share time with Deputies Mary Upton, Ruairí Quinn, Kathleen Lynch and Jan O'Sullivan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">The recent scandals at FÁS have taken the organisation to such new lows that its name alone evokes any number of negative connotations.  Its unfortunate association with the Fianna Fáil Party has cast a further shadow over its reputation.  Whether one argues that this patronage is real or perceived, it is now time to end the era of the nod and the wink and sever the long association with the Fianna Fáil movement.  It is time to break this unofficial link and rebuild the organisation so that FÁS can re-ignite a sense of trust in those who avail of its services.  Let us be sure that people will from now on be 100% confident that FÁS is apolitical in its approach to everything it does.  We must strive to bring FÁS back from the brink and excise from its employment anyone who is being carried unnecessarily.  Its upper echelons have tarnished the authority's standing in the public eye.  The reasons for this are well documented and have been covered extensively by my colleague, Deputy Shortall.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">However, we must be mindful of the fact that there is much to praise in FÁS.  The Labour Party is determined to assist in the restoration of its reputation.  It is important to acknowledge the good work that currently goes on in FÁS, which has a network of 66 regional offices and 20 training centres across the country.  The majority of its work is carried out at a grass-roots level through the hard work of its training and education supervisors, employment scheme participants, business advisers and recruitment specialists.  It has specifically catered for the marginalised in our society.  Through initiatives aimed at people with disabilities and members of the Traveller community, FÁS has always sought to empower and include all citizens of our country at a grass-roots level.  Its wider horizons initiative aims at increasing understanding among young people north and south of the Border, reconciling the two traditions while increasing work skills for every participant.  At ground level, the work carried out by FÁS helps people from all walks of life to find jobs and obtain training, and promotes work throughout our communities.  We must not ignore this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">My experience of FÁS at a local level has been positive, and it would be unfair to associate the local workers with the shenanigans of those within the hierarchy.  What these people on the ground represent is far removed from what the hierarchy has come to embody.  Where it represented neglect, the work of those on the ground is characterised by a sense of duty and obligation to the people they were supervising through the community employment schemes and in the various offices throughout the 66 centres.  Where waste is widespread among a minority at the upper level, the majority have come to represent a significant investment in our communities.  This cannot be overlooked in our efforts to reform the organisation.  FÁS has given hope to many in terms of their own personal circumstances and those of their neighbourhoods.  I am representative of a largely rural constituency and I have seen first hand the benefits yielded by the community schemes, spearheaded by FÁS and managed by local people working within those communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">As with all State-funded bodies, cutbacks have affected the services offered to people in both rural and urban communities.  The idea that the waste at the top level of FÁS ran parallel with the reduction of valuable services to communities has angered the public and the body politic alike.  We have every right to be angry but we must differentiate between the person in the board room and the worker on the street.  Our anger must be channelled appropriately.  This anger laments the fact that this fine institution should have become a vessel for such waste when it has been a force for good.  I believe it can be a force for good again, but we must bring about the necessary changes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_401">
          <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_1040">Since its inception in 1987, FÁS has undoubtedly provided vital training, support and education to workers throughout the country.  Through its various training courses, employment fairs and recruitment services, FÁS offers people a chance for educational betterment and future employment.  Now, more than ever — as Deputy Sherlock has just said — such activities are of paramount importance to many sectors and workers within our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">I have no doubt the overwhelming majority of FÁS's staff of more than 2,000, in its 66 offices and 20 training centres throughout the country, are hard-working and diligent employees who endeavour to develop FÁS into the vibrant organisation it was originally intended to be.  Undoubtedly, the 40,000 who completed FÁS training programmes and the further 25,288 who completed employment programmes in 2008 would speak positively of the merits and values of the organisation.  Unfortunately, however, that is not what we are discussing this evening.  It is not what people are talking to me about when I go out canvassing or what they are discussing around their kitchen tables at home.  Instead, we are talking about another case of greed and incompetence.  We are discussing golden handshakes and senses of entitlement when we should be talking about the 424,000 people on the live register and the effect that unemployment is having on them and their families.  We should be considering how we can best meet their training or retraining requirements through FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">It is clear there has been serious breakdown and decay within the upper echelons of FÁS, leading to the astoundingly profligate spending and numerous wasteful acts which are tarnishing the reputation and legacy of the organisation.  This culture of entitlement that seems to exist in the rarefied air of some semi-State bodies needs to change.  How can the Government tell people on social welfare or hard-pressed public servants that they must take the pain when they see that €600,000 was spent on a television advertisement that was never aired?  How can the Government call for pay restraint when the public has seen a golden handshake of more than €1 million for Rody Molloy?</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">The wasteful spending within the organisation has dogged the constructive work carried out by FÁS for the best part of the last year.  The recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General disclosed further examples of wasteful spending that was almost systemic.  A total of €622,000 in expenditure cannot be accounted for during a six-year period.  The revelations in the report would be scandalous enough if taken in isolation; however, when combined with the findings of the FÁS internal audit report which came to light late last year, they call into question the oversight and financial control within FÁS.  The internal audit report mentioned, among other things, that FÁS spent at least €1 million more than should have been the case on the establishment of the Jobs Ireland website at a cost of €1.7 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">Operating under the supervision of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the aim of FÁS, as detailed in its 2006 to 2009 strategy, is to conduct business</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1045">. . . in a prudent manner and in accordance with best practice compliance, governance and risk management.  Protecting FÁS resources and seeking out value for money in the work we do by achieving the greatest efficiency and effectiveness for the minimal cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The strategy goes on to point out that value for money is one of the central tenets and aims of the organisation.  I ask the Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment how the wanton spending which has taken place could be in line with such lofty and, indeed, laudable ideals.  How does spending €9,200 on a car for a raffle which never took place qualify as value for money?  We need to ask similar questions, as mentioned earlier in the debate, of the Ministers, Deputies Micheál Martin and Mary Harney who, in their roles as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, presided over such inefficient use of taxpayers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">Who is accountable for such waste of taxpayers' money, money which could be better utilised in further training and development of the 424,000 people currently on the live register?  Certainly, not the former director general, Mr. Rody Molloy, who without sufficient legal advice and in breach of the Department of Finance guidelines on severance pay received a golden handshake of more than €1 million at the end of his so-called successful tenure in charge of the organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">Why did the former director general, following his resignation from that post, receive a top-up of the equivalent of five years' service, which is at the upper limits of Department of Finance guidelines?  Why was legal advice not sought on this serious issue, a matter raised by my colleagues a number of times?</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">I believe the board should, sooner rather than later, be restructured along the lines proposed in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The members of that board failed in their remit and should be removed from their post as opposed to meekly resigning in the coming weeks or months.  Once again the actions of a few have coloured the positive work of an entire organisation.  People who rely on FÁS for support and education now view its activities with scorn as wasteful spending follows wasteful spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">What we have is a small circle who believe they are worth every penny and every expense.  If it was only FÁS that was guilty of this type of practice, people might not be furious.  However, this culture exists in so many areas.  It is indicative of a Government and its cronies who are out of touch with the real people of Ireland.  How could the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when on radio call the golden handshake "a few pounds"?  How can a body which receives very substantial State funding shell out more than €20,000 for a Minister to visit race meetings?  How could a former Minister of State become the head of one of the most powerful lobby groups in the country before his desk is barely cleared?</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">What we need is a change in Government and a change in the way government does its business.  I wholeheartedly support this motion to get FÁS back working for the people on the live register, not the elite who would use it as a slush fund.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_402">
          <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_1052">In the limited time available to me I wish to address my comments to the Minister of State present in the House, Deputy Billy Kelleher.  I suggest to him, as the Minister of State with responsibility in this area, that he has a particular responsibility to bring the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to account and to ask him what he was doing about the four departmental representatives on the board, namely, representatives from the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance, Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs.  He must ask whether they met as a collective group and whether they conferred.  This was a body that was receiving €1 billion in funding.  We are not speaking of a small semi-State agency but of a massive organisation, as already outlined by Deputy Sherlock.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">What type of co-ordination existed on the part of the Secretary General?  It is easy, politically, for us to lambaste the Minister of the day and for us to perhaps refer to some members of the board.  However, if a board is in the position whereby the truth is being withheld from it, it has limited capacity to act. I recall that when I was Minister for Enterprise and Employment, previously Minister for Labour, there was a much tighter and closer understanding between the Department of Labour, civil servants and some sections of what was then AnCO, which was as Deputy Mattie McGrath stated FÁS's previous incarnation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">I understand that talks and hearings on this issue will be ongoing between the Committee of Public Accounts, other relevant committees and the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.  It behoves the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, as the Minister with political responsibility in this area to find out where was the management breakdown in his Department that allowed these things to happen.  What is the point of ministerial appointments to boards of an organisation if such people do not act as a watchdog for the primary Department and other Departments?  This is a failure of public service.  The relevant sections in the senior echelons of public service in this country who have served us well need to start looking into their dark souls and to ask themselves hard questions.  How is it even acceptable that someone who has so manifestly failed in public management, Mr. Rody Molloy, was so outrageously rewarded?</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I listened to the Minister of State's contribution and read carefully the opening statement made by my colleague, Deputy Shortall and the inadequate response from the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, in regard to the terms and legalities of the settlement on which we will not finish our deliberations tonight.  There are other institutions within this House where this will be pursued.  I am of the view that the law was not complied with.  Contradictory statements have been given on a number of occasions, not by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, but by others with political responsibility.  This is an issue that will not go away.  We will, when the Bill to appoint the new board of FÁS comes before the House, have an opportunity to ask questions about its formation, nomination, role and accountability to the primary Department.  The Minister of State may not hold his current portfolio for much longer or may, perhaps, hold it for another two years.  He has a responsibility not to look at the departed board members but to ask why it was that a Department like his with such a large budget and an extraordinary amount of money going to FÁS, systematically failed to detect that something wrong was happening at management level.  The Minister of State has a responsibility to ask the Secretary General of his Department what was going on.  I suggest, for example, that he ask him where was the monthly report from the civil servant from his Department on the board of FÁS and whether the representatives of the other three Departments forward a monthly report to his Department.  Were they co-ordinated?  What was the State getting from the participation of those people on the board?</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">I am focusing in deference to time on this narrow point.  There are many other comments I could make on many other areas but time does not permit me to do so.  I want to deliberately return the spotlight to the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, as the political person with responsibility in this area for which he is accountable to this House and to the Secretary General of the Department and officials from that Department and the other three Departments who sat side by side with the external social partner appointees.  I ask the Minister of State to come back into this House and give us a report in that regard at some stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1057">Deputy Quinn spoke about the restructuring of the board of FÁS.  I have received queries from people concerned about the worker-director element of that board.  They believe that the reduction in the number of appointees will result in worker-directors no longer having a place on the board.  I believe that would be a retrograde step.  At the end of the day, public accountability should ensure the greatest possible level of scrutiny on the part of any board.  This will only happen if worker-directors are appointed to boards.  That is not to suggest that other appointees will not do a good job.  I believe the new board, when in place, will be a good one but only because the previous one was so negligent in its responsibilities.  Regardless of who we knew on that board, who was a member of it or what reputation they had, the board was negligent and disgraceful.  To say information was withheld is only half an argument.  It must be stressed that while the board could have asked what was going on it did not do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">The 400,000 plus people on the live register are the ones suffering in this scandal.  They are seeking to upskill to ensure they will have a place in the new market and they are not being facilitated.  I agree with Deputies Upton and Sherlock that the people working at the coalface of the FÁS organisation are the people we turned to in the 1980s and early 1990s when times were bad.  They were the people who gave workers hope and who had the contacts to ensure people could get back into work.  They are still the people we should look to.  A type of paralysis has come over the FÁS organisation, a paralysis brought about by the appalling conduct of a few at the top, all of whom were, in one guise or another, appointed by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">I acknowledge we are concentrating tonight on the Dublin-based organisation. The Minister already knows about senior managers from FÁS in Cork standing shoulder to shoulder with Ministers outside churches giving out Fianna Fáil election literature.  That does nothing for public confidence in the organisation.  On the other hand, we hear of minor officials in local authorities, grade 3 entry level staff, being told they are not to canvass.  There is something seriously wrong, and it is a worrying development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">There is a direct connection that must be broken and the only way to do that is to get this Government out of office and keep it out for at least three terms so we can ensure that the golden circle is broken up.  We should be here tonight to discuss how we will get 400,000 back to work and how best to serve them.  The State training agency, FÁS, is the agency we should look to for that.  Instead, the cloud that now hangs over it does not allow it to develop to its full potential as an organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">The history of politics is littered with the gravestones of Governments who have tripped over hurdles they have made for themselves, Governments whose tenures become crystalised in a single symbol.  For Margaret Thatcher the hated poll tax became a symbol of distrust for the common man, a lightning rod for discontent in England.  Charlie Haughey will be forever known as the man with the Charvet shirts.  For this Government, incompetence and waste has exaggerated all that was wrong with a society based on greed.  The perception of a golden circle will be how this Government will be remembered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The Government has rightly been saddled with that perception.  It has allowed too many people to dip their snouts in the public trough.  Now, as we move closer to an election, the Government's rear end moves ever closer to the bacon slicer and Fianna Fáil and the Green Party know it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">As Deputy Quinn explained, the Government, even at this late stage, must take drastic action to accept its share of responsibility for the errors that were made and show some sign that it has learned from past mistakes.  To do that, we must ensure that those who desperately need the support of the Government get it.</p>

I want to go back to the issues surrounding the severance package given to Rody Molloy and the €1.1 million golden handshake he received.  I refer to the contribution of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, and the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, tonight.  Serious issues remain to be addressed and there is a great deal of wooliness surrounding the questions of why the money was paid and why no legal advice was sought.  The Minister's contribution last night cast more doubt over the issue rather than clarifying the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">Deputy Shortall asked last night if he resigned or not.  If he did resign, why was he given the €1.1 million golden handshake?  Why was he entitled to a severance package if he resigned?  If he was sacked, why would he have had a right to the severance package?  How was he entitled to this package and why did the Tánaiste not seek legal advice?</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The Minister of State said the Tánaiste acted under section 6(3) of the Labour Severance Act.  That Act relates to severance.</p>

          <p eId="para_1069">My understanding was that it was the Labour Severance Act.  One way or another, regardless of the title of the Act, there is still a huge degree of confusion surrounding the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">Last night, the Tánaiste said: "I can assure the House that the decision taken to agree to the addition of years to his pension entitlement was not taken lightly.  Securing his departure in a non-litigious manner was considered to be in line with the best interests of both the FÁS organisation and the taxpayer."  She continued that if the board of FÁS had dismissed Mr. Molloy, court action might have resulted.  The Tánaiste then mentioned legal advice, stating: "I want to make it clear to the House that in relation to the issue of legal advice in respect of the veracity [I do not know why "veracity" is the word used there] of any possible legal action by Mr. Molloy, this did not arise as, although present, concern over legal action was not the deciding factor."  Previously, however, the Tánaiste referred specifically to legal action twice.  She spoke about securing the departure in a non-litigious manner and then said it might have ended up in court action being taken.  Despite the concern about those two central issues, she did not seek legal advice.  In the interests of clarity and public probity, we must know why legal advice was not sought in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">Deputy Shortall has called for the publication of the text of the agreement reached with Mr. Molloy and I concur fully in that regard.  We are talking about €1.1 million of taxpayers' money, with all of the other waste that went before it, including €622,000 that was unaccounted for, €9,000 spent on a car that was never delivered, €600,000 on a television advertisement that was never screened and more than €1 million spent on a website.  The Dell workers in my constituency who are turning to FÁS now to address their interests see such waste going on at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">The Government's contribution to the debate tonight raises more questions than it answers.  There is a much bigger issue than the best interests of FÁS, the only thing that appeared to drive the Tánaiste's actions.  We are not just talking about a sizeable amount of taxpayers' money, but the whole issue of public morality and credibility.  People are watching the dishing out of €1.1 million to someone who failed entirely in the job he was given and they are seeing the same happening to those at the top level of banking.  Very significant amounts are handed out at the upper levels without even legal advice while, at the same time, at the lower levels people are losing their houses and jobs and the smallest amounts of money are being chased.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">I sat on a steering group for a scheme for people with brain injuries.  A local representative of FÁS also sat on that steering group and that person was exemplary in his work on that group.  He had to account for every penny FÁS put into the scheme.  I was impressed by how the system worked at that level.  Those people have been let down by their masters at the top of the organisation, as we have been let down by those at the top of the political system and those working in banks have been let down by the people at the top of their sector.  It is about time there was a complete cultural change.  By signing off on the €1.1 million golden handshake, the Tánaiste has rubber stamped the Government's support for bad behaviour in high places.  It is time for a total change in culture.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
          <p eId="para_1074">Following the debate of the last two days, I would like to make a few points on the matters raised by the Deputies, and about the duties and responsibilities of FÁS.  Since May 2008, the Tánaiste has quickly taken appropriate and effective action as soon as issues emerged about FÁS.  It was the Tánaiste who requested the Comptroller and Auditor General to consider undertaking a special review of FÁS, and he acceded to that request.  A copy of the report that deals with the examination of advertising and promotion in FÁS, and which forms part of the investigation, was laid before this House and is now the subject of examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I understand from the Comptroller and Auditor General that a further report will be issued in the coming months, which will examine the arrangements for internal control and governance that existed in FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">In November 2008, after initial intense negotiations on the terms of his departure, the then director general tendered his resignation following reports of excessive travel expenditure in the organisation and he has been replaced by a new and exemplary director general.  Yesterday, the Tánaiste published the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009, which addresses a number of the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts regarding the size and composition of the board of FÁS.  The Bill also includes a specific provision designed to provide a level of protection for so-called whistleblowers, which will further facilitate identification of any future irregularities in the organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">Last month the live register fell by 16,500 people.  While it is traditional for the live register to fall in September, the level of decrease compared to last year suggests an improvement in the unemployment figures.  However, 423,600 people remain on the live register and the Government is committed to continuing to provide these individuals with the necessary assistance during this difficult period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">To respond to the increasing numbers of people on the live register, the Department is working closely with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science to ensure that appropriate responses are developed and put in place to meet the up-skilling needs of those who are losing their jobs or facing uncertain employment prospects.  It is the response to that situation which should now be our focus, particularly the response to the situation of the new unemployed, who may need a different, tailored response to that on offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">FÁS employment services, together with the local employment services, have put in place measures to double their job search support capacity to cater for the rise in referrals from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  In addition, the employment subsidy scheme will protect up to 27,400 vulnerable but viable jobs in the manufacturing or internationally traded service sectors that are currently engaged in exporting.  This scheme will involve the payment of a subsidy to firms to retain an agreed level of jobs. Enterprise Ireland is currently considering the applications under this scheme.  In time, the Tánaiste will review the scheme to ensure that it has maximum impact on sectors that are strategically important for our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079">I would like to endorse what Deputy O'Sullivan said about the work of the majority of the staff in FÁS.  I have had the pleasure of working with some of the FÁS staff in her region on their application for the globalisation fund.  They were exemplary and completely in touch with the needs of those who are unemployed.  I fully agree that they have been let down by the minority of senior management who have done this to the organisation.  We in this House owe it to all the FÁS staff to endorse the work that they are doing on a daily basis, and to endorse their probity and commitment, not just to the organisation, but to the people that they serve.  It has been difficult enough for them to face the increasing number of unemployed, but it has been unfair to have to face these other challenges.  I am glad to see that most speakers in this debate are in agreement with these views.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">The Tánaiste has responded quickly and effectively to issues relating to FÁS as they presented themselves.  She has at all times worked to ensure that the organisation can refocus to address the key challenge of unemployment through its job search, training and employment programmes in this changing economic environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1083">During the recent referendum campaign, I was struck by the number of times that FÁS employees stepped out from the shadows to speak to me, while at the same time looking over their shoulder, possibly in case somebody from Fianna Fáil was listening in.  They were people in the middle ranks of FÁS doing their jobs and anxious to provide services to the 400,000 people who are unemployed.  They felt ashamed, perturbed and angry to the point of despair at what had happened to the organisation.  Person after person identified a feeling among staff in FÁS that it is essentially an organisation which, although a public service organisation, has heavy political influences, particularly from Fianna Fáil, that make it a by-word for the sort of crony capitalism and crony public service that nobody in this country wants or can afford.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">The organisation was spending around €1 billion in public money at a time when this country had practically full employment.  Now that we have a massive and growing unemployment problem, it does not seem to be able to turn around and drop the things that it was doing, many of which were generated by an excess of funds in the organisation, and start spending every penny wisely in enabling and empowering people to get back into the jobs market and to become employed again.  At the moment, FÁS seems to be like the <i> Titanic</i>.  We know the iceberg is there, we know FÁS is there, but the Minister and her Ministers of State seem unable to confront the enormity of the task that faces them on behalf of taxpayers and citizens in this country to give hope and opportunity to those 426,000 people who are unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">FÁS took over from the VECs whole areas of apprenticeships and apprentice related training.  Now that we have many qualified apprentices with nothing to do, we have a FÁS organisation which is sclerotic and unable to respond and give hope to people.  The Labour Party has put forward a series of proposals about graduate placement schemes, graduate internship and graduate opportunity schemes.  The Minister gave herself a pat on the back last night, and her response and that of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Education and Science, is to create a vague and unspecified 2,000 places or opportunities.  This is the sum total of her response to the desperate situation that pertains to people who have graduated and qualified to become teachers, plumbers, carpenters and so on.  They were educated with an expectation that they would find employment in this country and now find that they cannot do so.  That is the biggest challenge facing FÁS, and that is why people are so angry at the revelations that have emerged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">Mr. Molloy was enabled with a departure package of about €1 million, having acknowledged in a public interview that his actions were inappropriate.  We were told that this was provided on legal advice.  As my colleague, Deputy Shortall, asked, where was the legal advice?  We know the Minister for Finance is a senior counsel, something he mentions frequently.  He signed off on the package, as pointed out by the Minister, Deputy Coughlan.  However, it does not seem to have crossed his mind that in saying <i>adios</i> to Mr. Molloy, the taxpayer, in a country where money has become a very scarce commodity — particularly with regard to public funds — might have sought some value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">The people who have served on the audit board of FÁS have spent a significant amount of time over the past year and a half trying to get to the core of the 22 or so issues — the ones we know about — that have arisen with regard to FÁS spending.  It is important that the Minister confirm that all of that audit work will be allowed to be completed when she introduces the new legislation.  The former director general of the IMF has said that when it goes into a country it knows that unless the government of the day is prepared to look in the eye the senior people in the country and tell them things must change, reform will not happen.  When the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, introduces the new legislation, will there be a full inquiry into all of the audits that have been conducted and the others that are to come, inquiring into unoccupied premises where vast amounts of public money were spent throughout the country, and will they be published?</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">There has been ferocious criticism from some quarters about the nature and size of the FÁS board which was so big it was unwieldy.  It reflected the times of social partnership and, in particular, the times and influence in the organisation of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  However, if the social partnership element goes, will we, instead of having a social partnership board, have a crony capitalist Fianna Fáil board in its place?  That would be worse.  Will we end up with the friends of Fianna Fáil, with a few Green Party people added in for decoration, dominating the new board?  If that is not to be the case, I challenge the Minister to take her nominations to the relevant sub-committee of the Dáil and to have the people who have agreed to or applied to serve on the board subject to an oversight process.  This would be a friendly but fair and rigorous oversight process, as is found in most parliaments, particularly in the United States.  If we are to continue to spend €1 billion on FÁS, we must ensure the people on the board are not the usual friends of Fianna Fáil but people who are prepared to turn the <i>Titanic</i> around in the interest of the 400,000 people who are unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">As Albert Reynolds said: "It is the little things that catch you out."  The board gave a package, but forgot to mention the car.  What is a car worth €20,000 or so to the people at the top of FÁS?  That amount is so small in the grand scheme of things for an organisation with a budget of €1 billion.  However, for taxpayers who were happy to pay their taxes and who hoped their taxes would contribute to education and help the unemployed get a second chance, the car was the last straw.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">I am sorry the Minister of State is not accompanied by the Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, and by the former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Micheál Martin, the man who commissioned so many reports he will have a longer row of library shelves in the British Museum than any other Irish politician, and by the previous Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, who travelled the world with FÁS and who has always been rather harsh about the public sector.  However, when she was involved with FÁS, she never had anything critical to say about it.  If Fianna Fáil can turn the culture around, if the Minister can subject her nominees to honest and rigorous assessment, we may then feel that Fianna Fáil cronyism has been contained to some small extent.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_412">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_1091">Over the past two nights this debate has centred on the need for accountability and proper corporate governance in one of our key State agencies, FÁS, and on the highly questionable deal reached with the former director general, Rody Molloy.  During the debate many speakers highlighted different areas of concern with regard to FÁS.  Different aspects of the FÁS operation remain which will be subject to scrutiny by both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Unfortunately, there is material there for many months to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">I want to address in particular the golden handshake.  However, before coming to that I want to refer to a particular aspect of the organisation which is of concern to me, namely, the top-heavy management structure within FÁS.  I urge the Tánaiste to devote some attention to this area.  When FÁS was created in 1988, it was recognised that it needed to be a regionalised organisation.  The services needed to be on the ground in all counties.  The management structure was organised to provide for a director general, a deputy director general and 13 directors, ten of whom were to be in the regions and three of whom would be in head office.  That amounted to 15 senior staff.  At this stage the management structure of FÁS consists of 36 senior staff.  It now has a director general, seven deputy director generals, ten regional directors, and 18 head office directors.  One might say FÁS is a classic example of an organisation with too many chiefs and not enough Indians.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">What is even more important is that the key problem with FÁS is that the emphasis has switched from regional services on the ground to the corporate organisation in head office.  The corporate body, endowed with a large budget, has enjoyed lavish entertainment and first-class travel for the members themselves, their wives, Department officials, Ministers, some journalists and various other hangers on.  In the past four years alone, FÁS spent almost €48 million on suspect promotion and advertising.  In the process it completely lost sight of its core function, the provision of employment and training services for people seeking work.  In short, FÁS members lost the run of themselves.  Nobody, whether executives, board members or Ministers shouted stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">It is probably not surprising that Ministers did not seek accountability from FÁS, given their complete lack of accountability to this House and the taxpayers in respect of the deal with Mr. Molloy.  Significant questions remain to be answered by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  Not only should Members on this side of the House demand answers, but the Green Party, if it has any sense of probity, should also demand answers before voting on this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">It may come as a surprise to some in Fianna Fáil that Ministers cannot do what they wish.  They are obliged to adhere to the law and are not above it.</p>

Senior civil servants and Ministers had clear responsibilities in respect of the law.  We deserve answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">In the absence of answers I put these key questions to the Tánaiste again tonight.  Why was no legal advice sought on the deal with Mr. Molloy when it was freely available from the Office of the Attorney General?  Why was it indicated there was a threat of legal action, when later the Taoiseach denied this?  Did Mr. Molloy resign or was he sacked?  If he resigned, as is claimed, why was he given a generous severance package?  What was the legal basis for the extra €1.2 million given to Mr. Molloy, when this was explicitly precluded under the Department of Finance's guidelines?  Why did senior officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment not consult these guidelines?  Given that all of this was impermissible under the law, why was Government approval not sought for this deal?</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Scanlon</from>
            <p eId="para_1414">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise the important issue of St. John's Hospital in Sligo.  The hospital looks after young disabled people and the elderly.  The hospital has 195 high-dependency beds.  I raise the issue because of concerns expressed by hospital staff, especially nursing staff, whom I met last week.  They outlined to me some of the difficulties being experienced in the hospital.  They told me that currently seven full-time nurses have not been replaced and five nurses are on maternity leave, which is a deficit of 12 nurses.  A total of 12 care assistants have been let go.  Two senior nursing posts have been vacant since last November, while a further 20 nurses who have been working at the hospital, some of them for 20 years, are currently on one-month contracts.  Staff are concerned that such staff will leave if they get an opportunity for a full-time nursing job and it is difficult to blame them in the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">It is my understanding that under the PCCC, primary community and continuing care, programme, those services were not to be affected by the moratorium on employment.  Will the Minister of State please confirm whether that is the case?  If it is, it is not being applied in the case of St. John's Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">Unlike many services the hospital has been operating within budget.  There was a proposal for a new extension to the rehabilitation part of the hospital under the national development plan.  What is the up-to-date position in that regard?  I raise these issues because they are extremely important in the context of the services provided at the hospital.  Patients range in age from 25 to 104, the age of the oldest patient in the hospital last year.  It is important, even in the context of cutbacks, that such facilities where care is given to the most vulnerable people in society are protected.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_425">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_1417">I am replying to this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank Deputy Scanlon for raising this issue on behalf of his constituents.  It provides me with an opportunity to outline the background to the current situation and to update the House on the action taken by the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">As Deputy Scanlon is aware, Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where that is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care.  The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including facilities such as St. John's Hospital in Sligo.  It is a community hospital which has provided continuing care services to older people since 1972.  It comprises four continuing care wards, one rehabilitation ward, a day hospital, a physiotherapy department and an occupational therapy department.  The facility has a total of 195 beds, which includes continuing care residential beds, dementia, respite and convalescence beds.  As of 30 September 2009, all 195 beds were occupied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">A full-time medical officer is employed to provide medical services to all inpatients except those in the rehabilitation department, which is under the care of a consultant geriatrician.  As part of a recent HSE review of "Medical services in the Acute Hospital, Sligo General Hospital and St. John's Hospital" it is proposed to implement a plan where a consultant geriatrician would provide additional sessions to the care of continuing care patients in St. John's Hospital.  There has been no reduction in the provision of medical cover and the proposal will enhance that provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">There is a funded complement of 106.5 nurses, as measured in whole-time equivalents, in St. John's Hospital.  Currently, there are three staff vacancies while five staff are on maternity leave and three staff are on long-term sick leave.  The director of nursing deploys staff to ensure that there is no clinical risk.  There is a funded complement of 63 whole-time equivalent staff.  Currently, there are three vacancies with an additional three staff absent due to sick leave.  Again, the director of nursing redeploys staff to areas of greatest needs to maintain safe levels of care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">No beds are closed in St. John's Hospital.  Management regularly reviews staffing levels to ensure that patient safety is not compromised.  The capacity of the executive to provide approved levels of service continues to be reviewed in the context of overall resource availability.  The local health manager has a clear responsibility to deliver services within allocated budgets and consistent with human resource directives.  That includes any decision on prioritising resources and the impact it may have on providing cover at all facilities.  That requires a stringent ongoing review of the application of the resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">The Government is clearly committed to the development of comprehensive services across the country.  As I have outlined to the House, the Department of Health and Children will continue to work with the Health Service Executive to advance that objective.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_1423">I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for granting me the opportunity to discuss this matter during the Adjournment debate this evening.  I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for children and young people, Deputy Barry Andrews, to the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1424">It is a matter of desperation that I bring this matter before the House.  I have never previously raised a health issue on the Adjournment debate.  It is a sign of the significance of the issue that I have done so this evening.  Cian O'Brien is a four year old child.  He will be five in a couple of weeks time.  He was born with cerebral palsy and developed severe epilepsy when he was two.  The epilepsy was controlled by medication until March of this year.  Since then his epilepsy has become worse and he has been in Cork University Hospital since May.  The team of doctors and nurses that has looked after him has been doing a remarkable job and his family is extraordinarily grateful.  They know that without the team's work, the child would have died.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">Cian has intractable epilepsy.  He is under the care of Ms Olivia O'Mahony, consultant neurologist at Cork University Hospital, who has tried every medication to try to control Cian's seizures.  These seizures can occur up to 400 times per day.  After numerous ECGs, MRI scans and other tests in Cork and the children's hospital in Temple Street, it was decided that Cian needed life saving brain surgery.  His family were advised at the start of August that the operation would take place in Beaumont Hospital within the first two weeks of September.  They were told a team of 21 medical staff would be involved in the operation.  The operation would involve a radical procedure being carried out which involved splitting his brain.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">On 1 September, Cian's consultant neurologist was contacted by the team in Beaumont to say that it was ready to "go" but did not have a paediatric anaesthetist and that contact would be made again when one was secured.  The consultant neurologist at this stage suggested that the family try to have the operation carried out in Great Ormond Street in London, but they were advised that this would take too long and that the HSE would instead carry out the operation in Beaumont.  On Friday, 18 September, Cian's family were advised by their consultant that Beaumont had been in contact to say again that it could not get a paediatric anaesthetist and therefore cannot do the operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">I have just one question for the Minister.  When will this child have his operation?</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_427" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy Barry Andrews</from>
            <p eId="para_1428">I am responding on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.  The HSE has informed the Minister that the case of the child in question, which is complex, has been the subject of discussion between Cork University Hospital and the relevant specialists at the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street.  Owing to the serious nature of this case it is being dealt with as a priority.  In the circumstances it has been agreed the patient should be treated in Beaumont Hospital and the clinicians involved are currently working to agree a suitable date for surgery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">In Ireland, adult neurosurgery is undertaken in Beaumont Hospital in Dublin and in Cork University Hospital.  There are currently 13 posts of consultants in neurosurgery, of which four have a special interest in paediatrics.  Currently, service provision for paediatric neurosurgery is spread between the two adult neurosurgery centres and two of the children's hospitals in Dublin.  All paediatric neurosurgery services will eventually be provided at the new national paediatric hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">The HSE commissioned a review in 2007 of current paediatric neurosurgery services in Ireland.  This clinically-led review supported an approach in which all paediatric neurosurgical activity is undertaken by trained neurosurgeons with a special interest in children, with close links to the adult neurosurgical service and in an environment which is focused on the needs of children.  This has informed an early decision to approve two neurosurgery posts with a special interest in paediatrics.  The HSE has allocated €2 million from development funds provided in 2009 to support the development of a citywide paediatric neurosurgery service in Dublin.  The two consultant posts are being progressed through the recruitment process and two consultant anaesthetist posts have been advertised to support this service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">This also shows the urgent need to bring together all complex hospital services for children in one national paediatric hospital.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_1436">The fact that I must raise the issue of a lady's entitlement to contributory widow's pension is no reflection on my colleagues in Kerry South.  The lady concerned is a business woman in Macroom town who provides valuable employment in a small factory, and has done so for the past 20 years or more.</p>
          <p eId="para_1437">I am confused and annoyed at the prevarication of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in this case.  Clearly, the lady concerned meets all the relevant criteria for qualifying for the pension.  The sole issue the Department is making a big deal of is the lady's address for purposes of communication.  I am aware from previous contact with this lady that she has had a difficulty with Cork County Council about planning permission.  She had an address in Cork, had a difficulty with planning permission and has used an address in County Kerry for the purposes of her application.  Her solicitor and I have made representations to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  She meets all the criteria regarding contributions and her marital status.  I fail to understand why the Department adopts such a bloody-minded approach on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1438">The lady was in receipt of this payment until 2003 but since then has had difficulty validating her claim to the satisfaction of the Department.  It requires political intervention at the highest level at this stage.  That is the reason I took the unusual step of raising an individual social welfare case on the floor of the House.  I appreciate that the Minister of State is taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs but I appeal to him to consider the matter favourably.  The woman has offered to meet with social welfare officials and has given an address that she uses but for some reason the Department will not accept it as valid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1439">I raised this matter earlier this week in a parliamentary question but received a meaningless reply, which is unacceptable.  At this stage, I can only put the case in the Minister's hands.  As he is not the Minister of State at the Department and given that I anticipate a similar response to the reply I received to my parliamentary question, I ask him to revert to the line Minister on this issue and ask her to re-examine the case as a matter of urgency.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_432">
          <from>Deputy Barry Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_1440">Widow's and widower's contributory pension is a social insurance based payment which provides pension entitlement on the death of a spouse.  To qualify for a widow's or widower's contributory pension a person must be widowed; not be cohabiting; and satisfy prescribed social insurance contribution conditions.  The pension is payable for the lifetime of the pensioner, provided she or he does not remarry or cohabit.  There is an obligation, under social welfare legislation, on customers to notify the Department of any change in their circumstances which may affect their entitlement to payment.  Customers are informed of this requirement when notified of the decision on their claim and at subsequent reviews.</p>
          <p eId="para_1441">Periodic reviews are undertaken to confirm a customer's continuing eligibility for receipt of widow's or widower's contributory pension. The following are some of the circumstances and events which would give rise to a review of a person's continued entitlement to pension: cohabitation; remarriage; change of address; change of post office; death of claimant or child dependant; a qualified child no longer living or being maintained by the claimant; a qualified child who reaches 18 years; imprisonment or detention of claimant or qualified child; claimant or qualified child leaving the State; change in household composition, including the birth of an additional child.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442">The person concerned was awarded a widow's contributory pension from 6 January 1995.  The weekly payment consisted of the maximum weekly personal rate of payment plus an allowance in respect of four qualified children.  In February 2003, correspondence addressed to the customer, relating to her continuing eligibility for an increase for a qualified child, was returned to the Department marked "Gone Away".  Follow-up inquiries by the Department conducted by a social welfare inspector failed to establish her whereabouts at that time.  Payment of pension ceased from 4 April 2003 as the Department was unable to establish her whereabouts and continuing eligibility for a widow's contributory pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1443">On 6 August 2009, the Department was informed by an agent acting on the customer's behalf of her new address.  However, when an inspector called to this address on 17 August, he was informed that the customer no longer resided there.  Another address for the customer was provided to the social welfare inspector and, on visiting this address, the occupants advised that the customer no longer lived there.  On 17 September 2009, a communication was received from legal representatives acting on behalf of the customer which gave another address for the customer.  The Department is following up on this information to establish the customer's personal circumstances and her eligibility for widow's contributory pension.  When these inquiries have been completed, a decision will be made on her entitlement to a pension.</p>

          <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_433">
            <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_1444">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter.  I do so because I believe the Minister does not understand the dire circumstances facing the cereal, beef and dairy sectors.  Having been involved in agriculture for many years, I have never seen farmers in such desperation.  Cereal farmers have experienced two bad years, with low prices and yields and high costs.  Many of them have been driven to desperate measures by these factors and the pressure being applied by banks.  Dairy farmers have never had it so bad.  Earlier this year, I experienced the anger and frustration of many young dairy farmers at a protest about low milk prices outside the Tipperary co-operative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">I do not recall such low prices across the farming sector and I am very concerned about prices in the beef sector.  As a result of the large number of cattle being slaughtered, some farmers have been unable to get their animals into abattoirs.  A monopoly in the beef sector is driving down prices and there is a large gap between the prices paid to farmers and sale prices.  Action is urgently required to address the problem.  The Minister must make a special case for dairy producers in Brussels to ensure a package is put together to secure their survival.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">Young farmers have invested substantial sums in the farming sector which is now on the verge of collapse.  Some farmers are ready to take their lives because of the dire financial circumstances in which they find themselves.  In the past three weeks, farmers have found out that their returns this year will be poor. While world prices will rise in a few years, many of our farmers will have left the industry by then.  Farming has a vital role to play in economic recovery and I urge the Minister to do something on their behalf to allow them to regain control of their lives and businesses.</p>

          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_434">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Trevor Sargent)</from>
            <p eId="para_1447">I thank Deputy Tom Hayes for raising this important issue.  As a representative of a farming community, I assure the Deputy that my visits to farms and farmers around the country have left me in no doubt about the level of hardship and despair in the sector.  The problem has not been helped by the weather in the past couple of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">There is no doubt farmers are facing difficulties at this time.  A number of factors have acted in concert to affect income for the farming sector.  These factors include a period of prolonged inclement weather, the general economic downturn, the banking crisis and poor prices by historical standards for most commodities.  The normal rules that would apply to a sector such as cereals where a low volume harvest should result in higher prices do not apply this year.  It is rare for such difficulties to come together but that has been the case this year.  This was balanced to a lesser extent by a drop in input prices and the continuing income support being provided by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">The issue of poor prices does not just apply to farmers.  A number of significant challenges are common to all sub-sectors across the food industry, including high costs, weak sterling, a slowdown in consumer spending and retail price pressures.  To address these concerns the Government is taking a number of steps, including promoting greater utilisation of existing enterprise supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">Through its support agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and Teagasc, the Government has developed or is developing a variety of enterprise supports, including the enterprise stabilisation fund and Leadership4Growth programme.  In addition, resources will continue to be prioritised both for applied research through Enterprise Ireland and fundamental research through the Department's food institutional research measure and research stimulus fund.  These measures are designed to increase the demand for farm products and help boost prices at farm gate level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">In 2008, direct payments to farmers accounted for approximately €2 billion, largely comprising the single farm payment — €1.3 billion — rural environment protection scheme — €312 million — and area based compensatory allowances — €256 million.  When other capital grants and investment schemes are included the total payments by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to farmers amounted to more than €2.6 billion in 2008.  Despite the current difficult budgetary position, a similar level of payments will act as an income platform for farmers in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">From the farmer's perspective, direct payments constituted slightly more than 30% of total gross output in 2008.  This shows that almost one third of total revenue on farms is derived from direct payments.  At a time when market returns are at low levels, these payments are very important.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">As Deputies are aware, the international dairy industry is facing serious challenges.  Markets for dairy products are extremely weak across the world, primarily due to a collapse in demand caused by the global economic downturn.  In the past couple of years, we have witnessed extremes of volatility in dairy product prices on an unprecedented scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">The Common Agricultural Policy contains support measures to help us manage the market.  During the health check negotiations last year, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, fought hard to keep the important measures in place.  Since the start of the current crisis, the Minister has pressed the Commission to use available market instruments.  He will also attend an important meeting of Agriculture Ministers in Austria in Monday and I will deputise for him in his absence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">Most of the available supports have been activated since the beginning of the year, including decisions in June to twice increase export refunds for butter, skimmed milk powder and whole milk powder.  These measures have helped to stabilise the position.  However, despite some signs of an improvement, prices remain low.  We will continue to maintain close contact with the European Commission and Council to ensure support measures operate at levels that will make a real impact in the market.  One important commitment the Minister secured this week from Commissioner Fischer Boel is that intervention stocks will not be released onto the market until it can take them without being weakened.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">In addition to these urgent measures, the Minister announced today the establishment of a dairy consultative group.  This announcement follows from last Monday's special meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers in Brussels at which there was a full discussion on the need for measures to manage the dairy market in the period up to quota abolition and beyond.  The consultative group will assist the Department in the deliberations that will take place in the coming months in the high level group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">The beef sector is extremely important to the national and rural economy.  Exports are significant, with 90% of output exported annually, making Ireland the largest beef exporting nation in the northern hemisphere and fourth largest beef exporter in the world.  Beef now accounts for almost one fifth of total food and drink exports.  I accept the Deputy's point that beef farmers are not seeing a sufficient amount of the return on these figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">Prices are a function of the returns available in the marketplace.  Given the sluggish market at present, the decline in prices during 2009, while extremely unwelcome, is not entirely unexpected.  Year on year prices are down around 12%, which is presenting difficulties for producers and processors alike.  However, it is important to remember that while returns have fallen, prices still remain ahead of those achieved in 2007 and these price falls are being witnessed across many European marketplaces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">The development of non-price strategies is fundamental to meeting evolving market challenges and demands.  To this end and in line with the Agri Vision 2015 action plan, a number of policy initiatives have been developed and enhanced.  These include Bord Bia Irish beef promotion strategies, the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme, the beef and sheepmeat capital investment scheme, breed improvement programmes and the establishment of the 2020 strategy group.  In addition, Bord Bia is implementing a major autumn beef promotion aimed at 40 million European consumers in ten major markets.  This promotion is being run in conjunction with key continental retail outlets and their Irish suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">At this time of increased competitive pressure, it is vital that we continue to implement effective marketing and promotional strategies aimed at consolidating and strengthening our position in the all-important European market.  Our traditional selling points remain our greatest strengths and it is upon these that we will continue to concentrate in the challenging times ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">I am conscious of the particular difficulties that grain growers have encountered with regard to this year's harvest.  The wet weather made harvesting conditions extremely difficult and impacted on grain quality.  It also impacted on the horticultural sector with some cereal farmers unable to access fields.  Thankfully, we had a couple of weeks of fine weather late last month which enabled the harvest to be brought in.  There have also been difficult negotiations between the farmers and grain merchants on the issue of price.  While this is a commercial matter between the parties, I hope they can arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">Ireland is not self-sufficient in grain production and prices here will be very much influenced by prevailing supply and demand conditions on European Union and world markets.  In so far as it can, however, this Government will continue to support the cereals sector with the aim of improving the efficiency, quality and viability of grain production.  In this regard, Teagasc is providing expert advice to the growers concerned while my Department operates a range of services such as seed certification, seed testing and recommending lists of varieties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">The opportunities farmers need to grasp are on a number of fronts.  Some have managed, through the organic options, to make their cereal farming more profitable than it was and there is a demand which needs to be recognised in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">The measures I have mentioned show the Government has a commitment to farming, and I hope the Deputy will agree.  I appreciate he is representing a lot of pain out there and I identify with that.  The Government recognises the importance of the agrifood sector in terms of output, employment and exports, and while there are short-term difficulties to be overcome, there is — the Deputy acknowledged this and I hope farmers will strive to make it through this difficult period — a favourable outlook for the sector in the medium to long term as we can see the global demand for food, fuel and fibre products from farming is growing as the world's population grows, which is something, it is to be hoped, farmers will benefit from.</p>

            <p eId="para_1475">I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 111, 114, 121, 122, 124, 137, 144, 145 and 176  together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The average processing times for claims decided in September was 3.63 weeks for jobseekers benefit and 7.53 weeks for jobseekers allowance.  This is the average nationally and there are fluctuations between offices.   The length of time it takes to process claims varies depending on the complexity of the claim, the availability of the necessary documentation from the applicant and or his/her employer and in the case of jobseekers allowance, the need to carry out additional enquires including the assessment of means and whether the claimant satisfies the Habitual Residence Condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">Processing times can also vary from office to office due to the extent of the increased claimload, the number of staff vacancies, the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office which impacts on the overall level of experience in the office.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">The Department put a particular focus on a number of offices in dealing with the older claims during August which would have impacted adversely on average processing times for the month. Tabular statements are set out below showing the average processing time for claims decided in September for each local and branch office and the number of claims that are pending award.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">Over the past number of months the Department has introduced a range of process improvement initiatives to deal with the increased volume of claims including:</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">A more streamlined procedure for claimants moving to jobseekers allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">A streamlined process for people who had a claim in the previous two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">Application forms for the jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department's website.  This means that anyone who wants to make a claim can print the form at home and bring it to the local office completed.  This helps reduce queuing times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">More straight-forward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">The process for casual employees has been streamlined and the employee can now self-certify on a weekly basis without recourse to the employer. A compensatory periodic control measure has been introduced for employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">One of the most significant initiatives introduced recently aimed at reducing queuing times and waiting times involves the customer attending the office by appointment at which time the claim is taken and decided.  This system has already been introduced in 20 offices and the Department is finalising plans to extend the initiative to a further 20 offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">The signing arrangements have also been revised in a number of offices and customers have been given an appointed time to attend the office in order to reduce queuing times.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">While every effort is made to ensure that applications are processed as quickly as possible, anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on their claim for a jobseekers payment can apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance which is subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions.  It is open to any customer who is not satisfied with the decision on their claim to appeal that decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">I fully appreciate that becoming unemployed and having to claim a jobseekers payment is stressful enough in itself. By introducing these initiatives I am trying to ensure that the process is as easy as it possibly can be. I know that processing times in some areas are still too long and I assure you that steps are being taken to bring them back to acceptable levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_2486">Under the Social Welfare Acts, a customer is disqualified for receiving jobseeker's allowance while resident, either permanently or temporarily, outside the State. Consequently, the allowance is not payable to persons travelling to other EU countries to seek employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2487">There are, however, two exceptions to this disqualification. A person may receive jobseeker's allowance for up to two weeks in any calendar year while on holidays abroad. There is also an exemption for anyone who is representing Ireland at an international sporting event in an amateur capacity. This exemption applies for the duration of the international sporting event and is additional to the two weeks holiday in any calendar year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2488">Under EU regulations, a person who is getting jobseekers benefit can transfer their claim to another EU member State for up to 13 weeks in order to look for work in that country. However, this provision does not apply to persons on jobseekers allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2489">To qualify a person must also have been in receipt of JB for at least 4 weeks before they leave for the second Member State.</p>

        <b>Deputy Andrew Doyle</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         the number of people claiming rent supplement for more than 18 months; her views on the slow transfer of people from rent supplement onto the rental accommodation scheme; the action she is taking to address this problem; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_437">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2495">There are currently almost 91,000 tenants benefiting from a rent supplement payment — an increase of 52% since the end of 2007. Over half of these recipients have been in payment for more than one year, while over 32,000 have been in payment for 18 months or more.</p>
            <p eId="para_2496">The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities. Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, RAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_2497">Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (DoEHLG) indicate that to date, local authorities have transferred over 12,000 rent supplement cases to RAS units. Housing authorities have also transferred a further 10,400 recipients to other social housing options, a total of over 22,400 transfers since 2005. Almost 7,000 recipients were transferred in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2498">It is accepted that progress in relation to RAS was initially slower than expected. However the pace of delivery has improved significantly, and in 2009 a target has been set of transferring an additional 7,000 households from rent supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2499">In addition to this official target, due to the numbers of unsold affordable stock around the country, an opportunity has been created to make use of some of these properties for RAS and it is expected that additional transfers may be possible in 2009, above that provided for by the 2009 target. The position regarding the availability of property is monitored on an ongoing basis, given the current market condition, and there may be an opportunity to achieve further transfers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2500">The changes made in Budget 2009 to better align the minimum weekly contribution required from tenants under the rent supplement scheme with that under the RAS should also encourage more people to take up RAS offers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2501">The Department continues to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support.</p>

            <p eId="para_2504">I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 151 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2505">The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman is a statutory office established in 2003 under the terms of the Pensions Act 1990, as amended. The Pensions Ombudsman is charged with investigating and deciding complaints and disputes concerning occupational pension schemes, trust-based retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts (PRSAs).</p>
            <p eId="para_2506">There are two important factors to be taken into account when looking at the efficiency of the Office. Firstly, the number of complaints received by the Office has increased very significantly — by 47% in 2008 and, in the first nine months of 2009, an increase of 68% when compared with the same period in 2008. However, while additional staff resources are not available to the Office, the introduction of a new case management system and streamlined complaint handling procedures has resulted in the number of complaint cases closed in the first nine months of 2009 being over double the corresponding number closed in the same period in 2008, a very significant increase in efficiency in the context of delivery of service to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2507">The Office, including the Pensions Ombudsman, has a staff complement of 10. Pay costs account for almost 80% of its budget. Accordingly, the current public sector pay freeze, pension levy and recruitment moratorium will impact on costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2508">The Exchequer allocation to the Office reduced from €1,058,000 in 2007 to €974,000 in 2009. In 2008, the Office secured a saving of €59,000, representing 25% of total non-pay cost. It is expected that further cost reductions will be achieved in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2509">Day-to-day operations at the Pensions Board are funded by income generated from fees levied on occupational pension schemes, PRSAs and interest income received. Several initiatives have been taken during the past year to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. In 2009, funding for the National Pensions Awareness Campaign was halved, to €500,000. In addition, significant savings have been made through a reduction in fees paid to Board members, reductions in cost for staff training and development, a reduction in printing of publications through greater use of internet technology, and cost reductions in areas such as advertising, recruitment consultancy and project development. The recruitment moratorium — which has resulted in the non-replacement of some contracted employees — and the pension levy also apply to the Pensions Board. It is expected that further cost reductions will be achieved in 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2511">Facilitators work with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance the skills that the individual has and ultimately improve their employment chances, as well as help them to continue to develop personally.

            <p eId="para_2517">I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 130 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2518">I want to assure the Deputy that the Department is committed to ensuring that claims for all schemes are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2519">People who apply for the One Parent Family Payment must satisfy a means test and provide evidence that they are living alone.  They must also satisfy the Habitual Residence Condition.   These processes may result in delays in awarding claims.  Delays can also occur where the applicants do not supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.</p>
            <p eId="para_2520">Operational procedures, the organisation of work, and the allocation of staff resources continue to be reviewed and restructured to maximise the processing capability in the scheme areas to improve these times. Process improvement initiatives have been introduced in local offices which are primarily designed to assist with the processing of jobseeker claims, nevertheless, will also have a positive impact on claims for other schemes administered in the local offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2521">Additional staff have been redeployed to local offices from other parts of the civil service and the Department has identified a number of locations where the increasing number of claims for means tested payments warrants the allocation of additional Social Welfare Inspectors. Arising from this, an additional 40 Inspectors are being assigned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2522">The tabular statement sets out the processing times for One Parent Family for September 2009 in the Social Welfare Offices that administer the scheme locally.  In some areas processing times are unacceptably high but every effort is being made to bring these times back to acceptable levels as quickly as possible. The Deputy will be aware that anyone suffering hardship can apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  SWA provides a safety net against poverty in that it gives a statutory entitlement to a minimum weekly income, based on criteria set out in legislation. The majority of SWA claims are processed within a matter of days.</p>

            <p eId="para_2701">The number of facilitators currently in place is 61.5 (half post due to a work sharing arrangement). It is envisaged that this number will increase to 70 in the coming months. The facilitator service is available locally to all social welfare recipients via the local network. Facilitators are assigned to cover a geographical area. They hold open clinics and meet with people who have been referred either by the social welfare local office, the employment support section or by other agencies.  In the current economic climate the demand for the facilitator service is elevated. Waiting times to see a facilitator may vary nationwide. Actual waiting times for individual facilitators are not available. An appointment can be made by contacting the facilitators directly or via the appropriate local office. Facilitators make every effort to contact customers as quickly as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2707">I propose to take Questions Nos. 118, 127, 140, 143 and 149 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2708">The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department. A key objective of the Department's control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2709">The Department processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and it makes payments to over one million people every week. The vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2710">Where overpayments occur the Department seeks to recover the overpayments and in cases of serious fraud, the Department will use all legal avenues open to it to recover the money defrauded and seek redress.</p>
            <p eId="para_2711">A four-pronged control strategy has been adopted by the Department, namely prevention of fraud and error at the initial claim stage, early detection through effective review of claims in payment, measures to deter fraud and the pursuit and recovery of overpayments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2712">Key elements of the Department's control strategy include systematic risk analysis, surveys of the levels of fraud and error within schemes, scheme specific review policies, data matching initiatives with both external and internal parties and investigation of anonymous reports. These control tools ensure that review activity is targeted in the most effective manner and ensure that where overpayments arise they are detected as early as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2713">Over 620 staff at local, regional and national level are engaged on a full or part-time basis on work related to the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system. About half of these work full time on control work, while the other half are responsible for routine investigations under the various schemes and for following up suspected cases of fraud where these are discovered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2714">The rapidly changing economic environment with large increases in the levels of unemployed poses challenges for the prevention and effective management of fraud and control.</p>
            <p eId="para_2715">The Department's response to these challenges has been to introduce new measures to target control activity at high risk categories of claimants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2716">For example:</p>
            <p eId="para_2717">Control activity is being focused on the prevention of fraud and error at claim application stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2718">The Special Investigation Unit is undertaking more regular interviews of jobseeker recipients, particularly those with high risk ratings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2719">As a preventative measure the option to receive payments by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) was removed for new claimants for jobseeker payments. They must attend in person at the post office each week thus confirming their continued residency in the country. Their claim is automatically suspended where two consecutive payments are not collected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2720">Border regions have put an increased emphasis on controls on claims from applicants with a previous address in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2721">One Parent Family Payment recipients with earnings are targeted for on-going review.</p>
            <p eId="para_2722">The frequency of issue of mail shots to validate continued entitlement to Child Benefit has been increased to 3 monthly intervals for EU worker customers and resident non-Irish national customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2723">The number of anonymous reports from members of the public has increased dramatically in the past year, with over 4,600 reports made at end September 2009 compared to approximately 1000 reports made in 2008. Each report is followed-up.</p>
            <p eId="para_2724">The Department is moving to a risk-based system which will achieve better value for money by focusing scarce resources on the most appropriate cases. For example for Disability Allowance, a new control review policy for the scheme was introduced in January 2009 which involves assigning and recording a risk rating at the award and review stage of all claims in the medical and means categories. A similar risk based control review policy is being piloted for Carer's Allowance with the same approach planned for Invalidity Pension.</p>
            <p eId="para_2725">New data matches have been initiated to effectively target reviews and generate savings. In 2009 data was received from The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, The Commission for Taxi Regulation, The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal and Local Authorities. In addition agreement has recently been reached with The Revenue Commissioners for data on capital assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2726">In relation to savings, at the end of August 2009, the Department recorded control savings of nearly €312m, which is 78% of the year to date target of €398m. The annual control target for 2009 is €616.5m. It is difficult to project what the control savings for 2009 will be at this point but it is unlikely that the Department will reach the control savings target of €616.5m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2727">It must be noted that control activity is currently being focused on prevention of fraud and error at claim application stage. Savings made from the detection of bogus claims at application stage cannot be estimated as the claim will not go into payment. However, this is the most cost effective mechanism of reducing losses through fraud and error in social welfare schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2728">The significant increase in the live register has impacted on the Department's capacity to review claims. The increase has put pressure on staffing resources and particularly on social welfare inspectors who are responsible both for carrying out means-tests on initial applicants and conducting anti-fraud inspections. Additional staff are being assigned to front line work, including an increased number of inspectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2729">In relation to information sharing, the department is involved in a number of data matching exercises which are very effective in identifying high risk claims for review and is an example of good cross-departmental co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2730">Every month commencement of employment data from Revenue is matched against the Department's schemes and investigations are conducted where warranted. Earnings data supplied by the Revenue Commissioners is accessed by staff at both claim application and review stage. All cases identified on the COE notifications are examined to determine whether there has been willful concealment of information by the customer. Where there has been concurrent working and claiming for 12 weeks or more or where the overpayment exceeds €2,000 such cases will be considered for prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2731">Other examples of data-matching initiatives include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2732">Department of Justice:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2733">The Irish Prison Service provides lists of prison inmates quarterly. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal Data provides data on compensation payments made and The Courts Service has provided on-line access for information on the probate index of issued grants.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2734">Control Division has also assisted the Central Authority for Mutual Assistance on a number of enquires. These enquiries resulted in this department supplying details on individuals where cases are being prepared for prosecution in agencies outside Ireland and the crimes involve a range of unlawful activity including money laundering and drug trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_2735">The Department of Education &amp; Science:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2736">Third level institutions are obliged to supply the Department with details of students registered for full-time daytime education. The student details are matched against the Jobseekers, Illness Benefit and Health Board databases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2737">The Department of Agriculture &amp; Food:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2738">Data are received from the Department of Agriculture &amp; Food on total grant payments issued to farmers.</p>

            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2740">The Commission for Taxi Regulation (CTR) supplies data on active taxi/hackney licence holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_2741">Department of Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2742">The Private Rental Tenancies Board provides information on registered landlords.</p>
            <p eId="para_2743">The General Register's Office:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2744">The automation of the office with on-line access now available to staff in this Department regarding births, deaths and marriages is proving very effective for control of fraud and abuse purposes.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2745">A number of control initiatives involve case by case searches. This Department works closely with the Department of Social Development in Northern Ireland and The Department of Work and Pensions in the United Kingdom. Cases are checked to ensure that there were no open claims in the Republic of Ireland while also claiming in another jurisdiction.</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_2746">The Department is committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them. In this regard the control programme of my Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.</p>

            <p eId="para_2749">I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 171 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2750">The Rural Environment Protection Scheme, REPS 4, was closed to new entrants in July of this year.  However, under the Rural Development Programme a new agri-environment measure will be introduced and individuals who have been affected by the closure of REPS 4 can apply for this new scheme.  On this basis, estimation of the number of farmers who may apply to social welfare schemes as a result of the REPS 4 closure is not possible at this time. Officials are in ongoing contact with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in relation to this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2751">The Department of Social and Family Affairs provides support for farmers on low incomes through the Farm Assist scheme which is a means-tested payment broadly similar to the jobseeker's allowance scheme.  It features a more generous means test, which takes account of the specific nature of farming and, unlike jobseeker's allowance, farmers claiming this payment do not need to be available for work outside of the farm in order to qualify.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">In recent years changes have been made to Farm Assist which means that it is now easier for low income farmers to qualify for support under the scheme.  In January of this year the rates of payment for the scheme were increased.   Improvements in the method of assessing earnings from insurable employment were also introduced in September 2007 which provides further gains for families claiming farm assist, where either spouse is also in insurable employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2756">An inter-departmental working group was established in March 2009, on foot of a recommendation in the Task Force Report <i>Transforming Public Services</i>, to undertake a detailed study on the feasibility and value of introducing mechanisms to simplify the provision of means information to all public bodies. This working group is chaired by a senior official of this Department. While the group is not examining a proposal for a unified means test, their work will include consideration of all possibilities in relation to simplifying and achieving other efficiencies across all public bodies with regard to means testing arrangements. The work of the group is progressing well and the feasibility report is expected by the end of 2009. While a more simplified system would be beneficial for citizens claiming state benefits and should result in a more streamlined administration, it is too early to estimate the level of savings which may arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">In relation to social welfare means tested payments, individuals in receipt of these and their families have differing needs and requirements, and are at different stages of the lifecycle. The means tests operated by the Department need to reflect these differences, where appropriate, to some degree. That said, the Department would wish to move to a less complex and more unified approach, especially for those of working age.</p>

            <p eId="para_2759">The money advisors throughout the country focus on providing assistance, advice and intense support to people who have financial difficulties. The money advisor works out a budget, negotiates on behalf of the client with all creditors including financial institutions and sub-prime lenders, to secure better terms for the client in managing the repayment of their debts. Where required by the client, the money advisor can assist with setting up a special account with their local Credit Union into which an agreed amount of money is lodged regularly and from which each month the money advisor makes the repayments to the creditors on behalf of the client. They provide ongoing support to people who successfully overcome their financial difficulties.  Focused training programmes designed to equip money advice staff and local management boards to meet the demands on the services are provided by MABS NDL the national support company. In addition, MABS NDL has introduced a number of community education and other initiatives to assist the local services in managing their increased caseloads. These include a money management education programme for people facing redundancy to inform them about managing on a reduced income and how to avoid getting into debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_2760">Under the statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears published by the Financial Regulator, all financial institutions including the banks and sub-prime mortgage lenders must, where circumstances warrant it, refer a borrower in difficulty for guidance to a local MABS office or to an appropriate alternative.</p>
            <p eId="para_2761">A new operational protocol ‘Working Together to Manage Debt' is now in place and is the result of almost 2 years' work by MABS NDL, the national support company for the MABS network and the Irish Banking Federation (IBF), the main representative body for the banking and financial services sector. The protocol sets out an agreed process by which IBF members and the MABS money advisors will approach debt problems experienced by clients. The protocol includes a commitment that no legal action will be taken as long as there is compliance by the client with an agreed repayment plan. I am confident that the MABS is well equipped to provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.</p>

            <p eId="para_2765">There are 53 local independent MABS companies operating nationwide. Each MABS is an independent legal entity, being a company limited by guarantee with a Board of Directors drawn from local voluntary and statutory services and community groups.  Each MABS company runs their local MABS service. Each company has a 3 year contract which covers funding and service delivery commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2766">All MABS companies operate an appointment system for meeting with clients.  Clients with urgent difficulties are prioritised for attention and are dealt with promptly.  Less urgent cases are referred to the Telephone Helpline and to the MABS website in the first instance.  The Helpline can now handle less complex straight forward single debt cases such as threatened utility disconnections and deals directly with the ESB and An Bord Gáis in relation to these cases.  Over 90% of callers to the Helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline advisor.  Some 10% of callers are referred to the local MABS for assistance.  The telephone Helpline also assists local services to manage their appointment lists by providing an initial MABS service to clients and ongoing support while they await their appointment with their local money advisor.</p>
            <p eId="para_2767">Local services monitor their waiting times for appointments and, where required, seek guidance and assistance in managing their caseload from MABS NDL, the national support company.

            <p eId="para_2769">Social Welfare Inspectors appointed under Section 250 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, investigate claims to all means tested Social Welfare Schemes, excluding Supplementary Welfare Allowance. Reviews of means tested payments are also carried out by Inspectors to ensure the conditions regarding entitlement continue to be satisfied. The Inspectors' remit also includes the combating of fraud and abuse of all the Department's schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2770">The increase in the Live Register over the last year or so has resulted in considerable extra demands being made on the resources of the Social Welfare Inspectorate. As a result of this, I sought and received approval for 40 additional assignments to the grade of Social Welfare Inspector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2771">Of these 40 posts, 21 Inspectors have already been assigned and are in place. Dates of assignment have been arranged for a further 6 posts and the process of assigning them is underway. Of the remaining 13 posts, offers have been accepted in relation to 8 posts and arrangements are in train to backfill their current positions in order to facilitate their transfer. Work continues on securing staff for the remaining 5 posts. All staff for the additional Inspector posts are being sourced by the redeployment or lateral transfer of serving Civil Servants either within the Department or from other Government Departments.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2775">I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 139 and 147 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that during 2008 the average time taken to process all appeals (i.e. those decided summarily and by way of oral hearing) was 22 weeks. However, if allowance was made for the 25% most protracted cases, the average time fell to just over 14 weeks.  Those processing times replicate those for 2007 notwithstanding the fact that there was an increase of 27% in the number of appeals received during 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">I am advised that there has been a further increase of 39% in the number of appeals received for the first nine months of this year over the corresponding period in 2008 and, while average processing times for 2009 are not yet available, I am concerned they will have deteriorated when compared to the 2008 position.</p>
            <p eId="para_2778">The processing time for appeals covers all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department's Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases and further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors where required.  Circumstances may also arise, normally outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which have the effect of unduly prolonging the time taken to process appeals. For example, delays can occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the proceedings.  In addition, adjournments may be sought by the appellant or his/her representative which would have the effect of prolonging the appeal process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2779">I am very concerned about any deterioration in appeals processing times especially in the light of the 39% increase in appeals received so far this year.  In that connection, two additional Appeals Officers were appointed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office in January.  Since then, however, four Appeals Officers have retired and I am advised that every effort is being made to have those vacancies filled as a matter of urgency.  Furthermore, in the light of the current situation, I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that he is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals.  In that regard, since the beginning of the year, appeals are being rigorously vetted with a view to increasing the number of cases which can be determined by way of summary decision as opposed to holding an oral hearing.  As a result, the number of oral hearings as a proportion of all appeals has fallen from 62% in 2008 to 58% to date this year.   In addition, a number of administrative measures have been taken so as to further simplify, streamline and improve the appeals process.   The number of appeals finalised so far this year has increased by 14% over the corresponding period last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2780">While improving processing times and introducing efficiencies remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, it is necessary at all times, given the quasi-judicial nature of the appeals process, to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</p>

            <p eId="para_2786">I propose to take Questions Nos. 129, 158, 166, 170 and 177 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2787">As Deputies will be aware, the rates of child benefit have increased significantly since 2001 having trebled for the first two children and increased by over 185% for the third and subsequent children. Partly as a result of this and partly as a result of an increase in the number of eligible children, overall expenditure on child benefit grew from just under €965 million in 2001 to nearly €2.5 billion in 2008. The Government is proud to have been able to direct such substantial increases in financial support to all Irish families in recent years. However, given the scale of the current economic crisis, it is necessary to address all aspects of the public finances so as to ensure that they are sustainable and to ensure that fairness exists in the allocation of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2788">It is in this context that the Minister for Finance announced at the time of the Supplementary Budget in April that the Government's intention to either subject child benefit to income tax or means-test it from 2010. The Minister had already asked the Commission on Taxation to consider the implications of taxing Child Benefit. The Government is considering the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation and the report of The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes which also have put forward proposals for reductions in Child Benefit rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2789">My Department along with the Revenue Commissioners has had discussions with the Department of Finance on the policy and operational issues arising from the possible taxation of Child Benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2790">The Government is considering the various options and proposals put forward in these recent reports and they will be taken into consideration in drawing up the Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">While it is possible to achieve a more targeted approach through either the taxation or means testing of Child Benefit, these approaches have significantly differing implications for the practical implementation and the families involved. Issues regarding the definition of income, the implications for low income families, the impact on poverty traps and the disincentive to take up employment need to be considered. The implications for the impact of means-testing the Child Benefit payment on poverty traps and the incentivisation of work would depend on the specific details of the operation of a means test including what is included as assessable income, the thresholds at which payments are withdrawn and the rate at which they would be withdrawn. The Government will be mindful of the needs of families, particularly those on lower incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2792">More generally, the Commission of Taxation presents a range of policy and operational issues for my Department particularly in relation to the pensions system, the PRSI system, the proposed taxation of social welfare payments including Child Benefit. These issues are being considered in my Department with a view to seeing how they can be best addressed. Some of these would require very significant changes to how my Department operates its various programmes. For example, if it was decided to proceed with the proposal to tax social welfare payments at source, the fact this would need to be implemented over a longer time frame was recognised in the Commission's report.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2797">The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers and has made considerable improvements in services and supports for them in recent years.  The carer's allowance scheme has been significantly improved in recent years and, in budget 2009, I continued this process. The rate of carer's allowance for those aged 66 or over increased by €7 to €239 per week and for those aged under 66 by €6.50 to €220.50 per week. These increases took effect from January 2009. Recipients of carer's allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_2798">Since 1997, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_2799">The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple.</p>
            <p eId="para_2800">This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of Carer's Allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits. A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package.  These levels surpass the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2801">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income. The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2802">It is estimated that the combined expenditure on carer's allowance, carer's benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carer's allowance will be €650 million in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2803">During 2008 an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process to develop a National Carers' Strategy. However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time lines which could be achieved. In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy. This position remains unchanged.</p>

            <p eId="para_2807">Decisions on statutory social welfare schemes are made by statutorily appointed deciding officers. These officers determine entitlement to social insurance and social assistance payments and liability for Pay Related Social Insurance contributions in accordance with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and regulations made under that Act. Determinations in relation to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are made by community welfare officers appointed by the Health Service Executive.  Guidelines are issued by the Department in relation to the legislation concerned to ensure consistency of decision making by deciding officers throughout the Department. In line with the Department's policy to promote the provision of information, these guidelines are also available to members of the public on the Department's website www.welfare.ie or on request from any social welfare local office. In addition, training is provided to deciding officers on their statutory obligations and the application of the principles of natural justice and fair procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2808">In relation to decisions made on claims which are wholly or partly dependant on medical evidence, such medical evidence as is provided is referred to one of the Department's medical assessors who expresses an opinion as to whether the customer meets the medical qualifying conditions for the particular scheme. The deciding officer takes this opinion into account when making his or her decision on the claim. In cases which proceed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and where medical issues are involved, appeals officers, as well as taking account of reports from medical assessors of the Department, also take account of medical reports furnished by the appellant and any other evidence including evidence adduced at an oral hearing where appellants have the opportunity to explain how they are affected by their medical condition. As a result, the appeals officer's decision may differ from that of the deciding officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2809">The proceedings referred to in the annual report of the Social Welfare Appeals Office were judicial review proceedings arising out of a claim for disability allowance. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs was the respondent in the proceedings. The Social Welfare Appeals Office was not a party to the proceedings. The claim was disallowed on the grounds that the claimant was not habitually resident in the State at the date of application. Having taken legal advice, and in the light of the exceptional circumstances of the case, the Department concluded that its decision to disallow the claimant's application for disability allowance was incorrect. Accordingly, the Department settled the judicial review proceedings at the earliest opportunity and the claimant's application for disability allowance has been allowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2810">There is ongoing communication between the Social Welfare Appeals Office and the Department on matters of common interest and, as necessary, guidelines, procedures and practices relating to decision-making are reviewed.</p>

However, with the general downturn in the economy at present, it is accepted that earnings in the previous 12 months may not be representative of expected earnings in the coming year.

            <p eId="para_2831">In assessing means for social assistance purposes, including the State pension non-contributory, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property (except the home). Capital may include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2832">Stocks and shares of every description, which are assessed according to their current market value.</p>
            <p eId="para_2833">Savings certificates/bonds/ national instalment savings, which are assessed according to their current market value.</p>
            <p eId="para_2834">Money invested in a bank, building society etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2835">The source of any capital held by a pensioner can vary. For example, it can include savings from income while formerly working, savings derived from the sale of property or other assets, savings from occupational or social welfare pension, gifts, inheritances, accumulated interest or dividends or a combination of these. Therefore, in determining a pensioner's means, it would not be possible or practical to distinguish savings derived from particular sources. For this reason, savings from all sources are taken into account in assessing means.</p>
            <p eId="para_2836">It is recognised that some pensioners may wish to save some element of their non-contributory pension or may have accumulated savings in the past. Accordingly, the current assessment arrangements provide for a disregard of an initial amount of capital. In the case of a single pensioner, the first €20,000 of capital is disregarded and the balance is assessed by reference to a formula. In the case of a couple, the amount disregarded is €40,000. In addition, the first €30 per week of weekly means from all sources including capital does not affect the rate of pension payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">Accordingly, a single pensioner who has no other means can have capital of up to €40,000 and qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. Where the savings exceed this amount but are less than €94,000, a reduced rate of pension is payable on a sliding scale. These amounts are double in the case of a couple at €80,000 and €188,000, respectively.  These means testing arrangements seek to strike a balance between the need to focus scarce Exchequer resources on those who need them most while also encouraging people to save. Any change to the current capital assessment arrangements would have to be considered in a Budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_3319">The current free travel scheme operated by the Department provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_3320">While the scheme is free for those who are eligible, all of the transport companies involved, including CIE, are paid for the service by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The estimated cost of the scheme in 2009 is €76.4 million.  Any extension of the scheme to include other EU citizens would have considerable cost implications.  Under EU law, it would not be possible to provide free travel only to British old age pensioners as this would discriminate on the basis of nationality.</p>

            <p eId="para_3325">The legislative provision governing the registration of domestic adoptions and the issue of birth certificates drawn from the register of adoptions is set out at section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952.</p>
            <p eId="para_3326">Under this provision the Registrar General is charged with maintaining an Adopted Children Register and also to maintain an index to make traceable the connection between each entry in the register and the corresponding entry in the register of births. The index is not open to public inspection and no information from it may be given to any person except by order of a Court or of the Adoption Board. A certified copy of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, if purporting to be issued under the seal of Oifig an Ard-Chlaráitheora shall, without further proof, be received as evidence of the facts stated therein and any requirement of law for the production of a certificate of birth shall be satisfied by the production of such certified copy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3327">Birth certificates for adopted persons are available only from the office of the Registrar General, located in Roscommon. While it is appreciated that this may cause a degree of inconvenience in certain instances the security and confidentiality of the Adopted Children Register is of paramount importance and it is for this reason only that the restriction on availability exists. For this reason also, there are no plans to amend the legislation to change the current arrangements in relation to this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3328">Arrangements are in place to ensure that persons applying to registrars' offices in Dublin and at other locations across the country where certificates of life events may be obtained, will be accommodated without any undue delay. For example, for passport application purposes, a copy of the required certificate will be faxed directly from the GRO to, and be accepted by, the Passport Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_3329">Responsibility for adoption legislation rests with the Department of Health and Children. An extension of the availability of certificates for adopted persons beyond the single physical repository of the General Register Office would require an amendment to existing adoption legislation or an amendment to new adoption legislation at present being advanced through the Houses of the Oireachtas by that Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3333">The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1st May 2004. It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the new EU Member States without the limitations being imposed at that time by many of the other Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_3334">A person who does not satisfy the habitual residence condition is not eligible for specified social welfare payments, regardless of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor.</p>
            <p eId="para_3335">The social welfare schemes concerned are Jobseeker's Allowance, One Parent Family Payment, Disability Allowance, Carer's Allowance, Widow/er's (Non Contributory) Pension, Guardian's Payment (Non Contributory), State Pension (Non Contributory), Blind Pension, Supplementary Welfare Allowance (except urgent or exceptional needs payments) and Child Benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3336">In view of the need to ensure that the operation of the new condition was fully in line with the criteria set out in European Court of Justice case law for determining habitual residence, the following factors were introduced into the Social Welfare Consolidation Act in 2007:</p>
            <p eId="para_3337">the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</p>
            <p eId="para_3338">the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</p>
            <p eId="para_3339">the nature and pattern of the person's employment;</p>
            <p eId="para_3340">the person's main centre of interest, and</p>
            <p eId="para_3341">the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3342">The Department of Social and Family Affairs is aware of the decisions of the Chief Appeals Officer in a very small number of specific cases, and is currently considering any implications of these decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3343">An internal review of the operational aspects of the habitual residence condition was completed by the Department in 2006 and copies were laid before the Oireachtas in February 2007.</p>

         her plans to allow self-employed persons pay additional social insurance in order that they are covered for jobseeker’s benefit in the event of unemployment.

            <p eId="para_3345">The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.</p>
            <p eId="para_3346">Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker's payments — these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed people pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these people enjoy. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_3347">There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.  Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as Jobseekers Allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3348">They can apply for the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year. In the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy. It is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years and this is factored in projecting future earnings, with account being taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.</p>

            <p eId="para_3353">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is a non taxable payment, introduced in 1984 to provide income support for employees on low earnings with families and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where they might otherwise only be marginally better off than if they were fully reliant on social welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3354">To qualify for FIS, a family must have at least one qualified child, a combined total of at least 38 hours insurable employment (other than self-employment) per fortnight or 19 hours per week and have earnings below the specified income limits.  For FIS purposes, a combination of hours worked by both parents may be used to reach the minimum 19 hours per week/38 per fortnight criterion.  FIS is calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the assessable income of the person(s) raising the children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3355">An integral part of the scheme is that once the level of FIS payments is determined, it continues to be payable at that level for a period of 52 weeks provided that the person remains in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3356">Furthermore a NESC research paper in 2007 proposed the abolition of the current FIS and the increases for qualified child — paid as supplements to SW benefits and allowances to benefit families with dependent children — and the introduction of a means tested employment neutral child income support payment.  However this proposal raises a number of significant issues which will require a detailed examination by my Department and other agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3357">There are no plans to abolish the Family Income Supplement.  However, proposals from the public service numbers and expenditure programmes, regarding social welfare schemes, including the FIS scheme, are being examined as part of the deliberation process for the budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_3359">The mortgage interest supplement scheme provides support for people who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayments and whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The scheme provides a short-term income "safety net" within the overall social welfare system to ensure that people do not suffer undue hardship as a result of losing their employment.  A supplement in respect of mortgage interest only may be paid to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  There are currently over 14,100 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 244% (10,000) over the number in payment at end 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3360">The assessment for the mortgage interest supplement scheme provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_3361">A review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is progressing.  The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence.  The review group includes representatives from the Department, the community welfare service, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Financial Regulator's Office.  The group is examining trends in programme and administrative costs, the impact of the Financial Regulator's statutory Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears on the mortgage interest scheme and legislative and other issues arising, including the cap on hours of employment.  The review is also considering whether alternative approaches to achieving the scheme's objectives are warranted in the light of recent changes in the economic climate and the mortgage market.  The full review should be complete in early 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3362">Following consultation with the community welfare service, guidelines on specific and immediate operational issues for the community welfare officers operating the scheme, have been recently updated.  The guidelines are available on the Department's website www.welfare.ie</p>

            <p eId="para_3366">I presume that this question should refer to the Pensions Insolvency Payment Scheme (PIPS), currently being established by the Minister for Finance on a pilot basis for a three year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3367">This scheme is intended as an option of last resort and a social protection measure to assist pension schemes where the sponsoring employer is insolvent and the pension scheme is being wound up in deficit.  The PIPS is intended to make it cheaper to pay for the pensions of retired pension scheme members, so that more money is available for the pension benefits of those who have not yet retired.</p>
            <p eId="para_3368">This scheme uses the definition of insolvency which applies to the insolvency payments scheme administered by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and as set out in the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act 1984.  The company mentioned by the Deputy will not qualify for the scheme as it is not an insolvent company as defined in the 1984 Act.  As the Deputy knows, latest available information suggests that some 90% of defined benefit schemes are currently in deficit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3369">Under the Pensions Act, trustees of these schemes must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to ensure that the financial position of the scheme recovers over time.  The vast majority of underfunded schemes are working with the Pensions Board to comply with the pensions legislation in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_3370">I have no plans, therefore, to extend the qualification criteria for PIPS to cover companies which do not meet the definition of insolvency.</p>

            <p eId="para_3391">Neither the Tánaiste nor I have any role in relation to the negotiation of ex gratia payments to employees in excess of the statutory minimum payments — this is entirely a matter of discretion for the company and an issue for negotiation as between the employees and the company.</p>

Should it be the case that the level of consultation and information as set down in the Act is not being satisfied, it is possible for a complaint to be taken before the Rights Commissioner Service which will hear the case and communicate the outcome to the parties involved.

The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery free of charge to assist this process, which, in line with the general principles of industrial relations in Ireland, is voluntary in nature.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing an extensive set of legislative conditions on the parties to an industrial dispute.

            <p eId="para_3403">The Government approved an amount of €100m in total for the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund for the years 2009 and 2010.  €50m has been included in the estimate of my Department for this purpose in 2009.  Under the scheme, Enterprise Ireland may provide up to €500,000 to viable companies with robust business models that are facing difficulties as a result of the current economic environment.  The fund supplies direct financial support to internationally trading enterprises that are investing in cost reduction or other measures to gain sales in overseas markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_3404">To date, Enterprise Ireland has approved approximately €44m for 98 projects under this fund.  Enquiries have also been received from a further 100 companies. However, these enquiries have not as yet progressed to formal applications.  To date, 10 projects have not been successful and alternative options have been examined for these companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3405">For reasons of commercial sensitivity, the names of companies who have applied for assistance from the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund are not disclosed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3406">The focus of the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund is to support viable but vulnerable exporting companies who are experiencing difficulties because of the current economic climate.  Unlike the Government's Employment Subsidy Scheme, the Stabilisation Fund is not a direct employment support and is intended to support the survival and expansion of exporting companies.  Accordingly, it is not possible to state the number of jobs being sustained directly by the fund.  However, details of sectors that have received financial support through this fund are contained in the following tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3407">Funding for the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund in 2009 is being kept under review at present and any expansion of the Fund must await consideration in the context of the 2010 estimates deliberations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3442">Ireland's system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.  Responsibility for the settlement of this dispute rests, ultimately, with the parties themselves.  The obligation lies with the parties to seek to resolve their differences and to carry their efforts through to completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3443">I understand that the dispute was referred to the Labour Court in accordance with Section 26(1) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990. This provision allows the Court to investigate a trade dispute where the Labour Relations Commission is satisfied that it is unable to further assist the parties and the parties themselves have requested the involvement of the Court. However, the Labour Court's recommendation is not binding on either party to the dispute and the Court cannot compel a company to comply with its recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3444">As the Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and consequently are prepared to accept the outcome of the process, namely the Labour Court recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3445">I welcome the decision taken by UNITE members to call off the strike action scheduled for 30 September at the Bank of Ireland in order to seek clarification from the Labour Court on its recent recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3446">In my view, the experience and expertise of the Court offers the best avenue for resolving the issues in dispute. To this end, I would urge the company to reflect carefully on the consequences of not complying with the Court's recommendation and would strongly encourage them to give a positive consideration to the recommendation.</p>

            <p eId="para_3458">However, the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is in receipt of an unprecedented level of claims for redundancy payment that are giving rise to very significant delays in the processing of those payments for both companies and individuals.  Currently, the average time it takes to process rebate applications from employers filed online is 7 months while claims submitted by post are taking 8 months.  The Department is currently processing rebate claims submitted online from March '09 and claims filed manually from February '09.</p>
            <p eId="para_3459">To put it in perspective, at end September 2009, the number of Redundancy claims paid by my Department relating to applications received in 2009 and earlier years, amounted to 32,127. This equates to payments of around €206.5 million, both to employers and, in some cases, directly to employees.  This means the Department is issuing an average of around €5.7 million per week in redundancy payments.  The backlog of applications awaiting payment at end September '09 stands at 43,250.

            <p eId="para_3504">The Central Statistics Office (CSO) publishes monthly both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The latter is compiled on a common basis across the European Union. The main difference between the CPI and the HICP is that the latter excludes mortgage interest costs. The CPI fell by 5.9 per cent in the twelve months to August while the HICP fell by 2.4 per cent over the same period. Most of the difference can be explained by changes in mortgage interest rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_3505">The CPI basket is based on average consumption patterns so price changes for particular individuals and households will invariably differ from the national average. The CSO does not publish indices by income decile or social group. Nevertheless, I would like to point out to the Deputy that prices of a wide range of goods and services have fallen on a year-on-year basis, not just mortgage interest.

This Scheme has terms and conditions which allow, in certain circumstances, for the payment of full pension benefits in cases where less than 40 years service is accrued. I am informed that the former Chief Executive had two years remaining on his contract. I am also informed that, having regard to independent legal advice and his exclusive availability to the Authority for a period of three months, the Authority agreed to the payment of an additional €151,500, equivalent to six months remuneration, plus an additional two months salary, to the former Chief Executive.</p>

            <p eId="para_3672">The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has primary responsibility for matters relating to the state body mentioned, including its pension schemes.  However as Minister for Finance, I am generally required to consent to pension schemes made by public sector bodies.  The legal requirement usually arises from the founding statutes of the organisation in question.  In this particular case, under the terms of the relevant legislation, pension schemes and arrangements for the body in question are subject to the approval of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3673">My role arises because of my responsibility for public service pension policy and for public service expenditure generally.  In this context I seek to ensure that the terms granted by the commercial semi-state sector are not out of line and/or likely to give rise to cost-increasing claims for similar terms elsewhere in the non-commercial public service.  My Department normally examines the pension schemes submitted to ensure that they are, broadly speaking, reasonable, proportionate and fundamentally sound especially from the Exchequer's point of view.</p>
            <p eId="para_3674">In the commercial public sector, employing organisations are responsible for the initiation and drafting of superannuation schemes and for ensuring that appropriate and sustainable financing arrangements are in place.  The parent Department, in this case the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, ensures, <i>inter alia,</i> that the superannuation schemes submitted for their Ministers’ approval are properly drafted, are broadly in accordance with public service pension policy, unless otherwise justified, and that they conform to the requirements of the relevant Departmental legislation.  Officials from my Department are involved in consultation with officials in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources concerning the scheme referred to by the Deputy.  It is hoped that, with cooperation from all parties involved, the scheme will be in order for the Ministers to approve in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_3688">Both AIB and Bank of Ireland were recapitalised with €3.5bn of Core Tier 1 Capital on 13 May and 31 March respectively.  In return the Government has received €3.5bn worth of non-cumulative preference shares.  These preference shares pay a fixed coupon of 8% annually.  If cash coupon is not paid, then ordinary shares are issued in lieu at a time no later than the date on which the bank subsequently pays a cash coupon on other Core Tier 1 capital.  Both banks were also given the option of repurchasing a portion of these preference shares early.  Assuming that the outstanding preference shares are not repurchased by the institutions, AIB and Bank of Ireland would each pay an annual coupon in arrears of €280m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3689">AIB are due to pay their coupon on 13th May 2010 in respect of the year 13th May 2009 to 13th May 2010 and as such they are expected to pay €280m on that date.  This will also apply in respect of the same period in the years thereafter.  As Bank of Ireland received the recapitalisation money on March 31st 2009 and are due to make their first payment on 20 February 2010, they are expected to pay their pro-rata share which is circa €249m.  Thereafter, a full annual coupon would expect to be paid each year on 20 February.</p>

            <p eId="para_3765">In late August, I was made aware of two significant reports regarding child welfare, protection and adoption in Vietnam.  The issues referred to in these two reports are of concern to the Government especially since they confirm anecdotal reports that have been aired in the past. Firstly, the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, with technical assistance from UNICEF in Vietnam, published a report known as the ‘MoLISA Report' entitled "Creating a protective environment for children in Vietnam: An assessment of child protection laws and policies, especially children in special circumstances in Vietnam".  The MoLISA report found that, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
            <p eId="para_3766">there are no detailed principles or criteria to guide the assessment in Vietnam of prospective guardians, foster parents or substitute  families for orphans;</p>

            <p eId="para_3778">In addition to the MoLISA Report, I have recently received, in draft form, the report of an examination of inter-country adoption in Vietnam carried out by the International Social Services (ISS) — a UN-affiliated organisation.  The Report was jointly commissioned by UNICEF and the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice and seeks, inter alia, to "identify and address problems in both domestic and inter-country adoption  processes with a view to assisting Vietnam in its preparations to ratify  the Hague Convention".  I will be considering these two reports jointly.  These reports go to the heart of the matter in relation to concerns relating to inter-country adoption in Vietnam.  I would be failing in my duty to protect children if I did not acknowledge and consider the content of these reports extremely carefully before deciding on an appropriate response.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_518">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_3784">I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 to 257, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3785">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the new Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which provides a free Pre-School year to eligible children.  In addition, my Office is also responsible for implementing the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) which supports community not- for- profit childcare services  to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.</p>
            <p eId="para_3786">Under the ECCE scheme, participating services will be paid a standard annual capitation fee of €2,450 in return for the provision of the free pre-school year.  The payment will be made, in advance, at the beginning of each term.   Services participating in the scheme should be satisfied that they will be in a position to meet all of their costs from the capitation provided and additional funding will not be provided where this is not the case.  Participating services may charge parents for additional services, provided these are clearly optional and children not availing of such services continue to receive appropriate programme based provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3787">A higher capitation rate of €75 per week (€2,850 p.a.) was announced in July of this year and will be available to sessional playschool services in which all childcare workers have qualification levels above the minimum requirements for the scheme.   To qualify for the higher capitation rate all Pre-School leaders in the service must hold a level 7 or 8 qualification relating to childcare and have 3 years experience working in the sector, and all assistants must hold a relevant level 5 qualification.</p>
            <p eId="para_3788">It is considered that the capitation rates are reasonable and will accommodate the great majority of services. The scheme represents an investment of almost €170 million annually in pre-school services and in light of the current economic situation there are no proposals to increase this provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_3789">Community services participating in the CCSS may also choose to participate and receive funding under the ECCE scheme.  Many services in the CCSS are eligible for a transitional funding rate in 2010 under which they will receive not less than 75% of the funding they received in 2007 under a previous support scheme.  In most cases, the level of funding paid to community services in the CCSS has increased and, in the absence of the ECCE scheme in 2010, not more than 25% of services would have been expected to qualify for the transitional rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3790">With the introduction of the additional funding programme, it is considered appropriate to take account of the total grant funding which this Office will pay to services when calculating any additional payments due under the transitional rate.  The following is an example of how this will apply.  A service which received €80,000 funding in 2007 and which qualifies in 2010 for subvention amounting to €50,000 would, in the absence of ECCE funding, receive €10,000 in transitional funding, bringing its total funding to €60,000.  If the service qualifies for €19,600 in ECCE funding, it will receive €69,600 in total funding in 2010 rather than €60,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_3810">From 1 September last, the National Roads Authority was tasked to undertake the management of the Regional and Local Roads Grants Programme on behalf of my Department.  This decision was taken on grounds of administrative efficiency, particularly in circumstances where there is increasing pressure on staffing and financial resources.  It makes sense to use one organisation to administer all road grant payments and to monitor the expenditure of these road grants.  The NRA already had very effective systems in place to administer the national road improvement and maintenance programme and it was therefore concluded that the most logical and efficient approach was to use that NRA expertise to administer regional and local road grants as well.  The new arrangement was concluded on an administrative basis so as not to affect my statutory role or that of the local authorities in any way.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of road authorities under section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  This statutory position is not affected by the new administrative arrangements.  The NRA is not being given any new statutory powers similar to those it has in relation to national roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_3811">Under section 82 of the Roads Act the Minister for Transport is empowered to pay grants to road authorities and under this power I allocate regional and local road grants to these authorities each year to supplement expenditure from their own resources.  This power is also unaffected by the revised administrative arrangements.  I will still continue to decide on grants policy and on the grant allocations to each individual roads authority.  Because there is no change in my statutory power I will also continue to be accountable to the Oireachtas as at present.  In particular I want to confirm that I will continue to reply to Parliamentary Questions on regional and local road grants.  There are no financial implications as a result of the change.  Regional and local road grants will be paid to the NRA as a block grant and disbursed by it to local authorities in accordance with the allocations I have decided.  The management role of the NRA is set out in the Agreement and I have arranged that a copy of the Agreement will be sent to the Deputy.</p>

I am further advised that local Garda management is aware of the difficulties that anti-social activity behaviour is causing in this area.  The area referred to is patrolled by uniform and plain-clothes units, including the local community policing and garda mountain bike units, which pay particular attention to incidences of public disorder and anti-social behaviour in the area.  Patrols are also supplemented by the district detective and drugs units, the divisional crime task force and traffic corps personnel.  Garda records indicate that regular searches of people and vehicles are carried out in this area.  To date in 2009, 391 searches of people have been conducted in the Clontarf Garda sub-district, 48 of which were carried out in the area referred to.  In addition, there have been 71 detections of offences of possession of drugs for personal use, 16 of which were recorded in the area referred to, with an additional two offences of possession of drugs with intent to supply.  Complaints in relation to public disorder and other anti-social type behaviours which are received by the Garda Síochána are investigated and offenders dealt with by means of adult or juvenile caution, fixed charge penalty notice, or the initiating of criminal proceedings.  Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences and maintain an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of the residents of the area.  This strategy is and will continue to be central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.  Local Garda management closely monitors the operational strategies in place, along with local crime trends and the policing needs of the community.  This is to ensure optimum use is made of resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  The situation will be kept under review and paramount consideration will continue to be given to the needs of residents.</p>

            <p eId="para_3836">It is not possible to provide figures regarding temporary release to the Deputy in the format requested as this would require the manual examination of records going back over a considerable time period. Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  There is no provision for "early release"<i>per se</i>.  I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that the number of prisoners on temporary release on 5 October 2009 was 609.  This represented 13% of the overall prisoner population for this day.  By contrast, the equivalent percentage of prisoners on temporary release for the years 1994 to 1997 was as follows: 1994, 22.2%; 1995, 20.2%; 1996, 17.9%; and 1997, 19.2%. The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release, in administering short sentences, in addressing humanitarian issues  and can be an incentive to well-behaved prisoners.  It should be noted that a prisoner on temporary release is still subject to his or her sentence and may be returned to prison without any court intervention.  Temporary release arrangements are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  It is generally accepted that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.  In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender’s Garda station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the gardaí.</p>

            <p eId="para_3842">As the Deputy will be aware, on 22 April 2009 I announced a new policy on the management of sex offenders in prison.  The new policy document is available on the website of the Irish Prison Service (www.irishprisons.ie).  The policy is aimed at bringing about changes in offenders' lives that reduce the risk of re-offending and enhance public protection.  It forms an integral part of the wider range of interventions by criminal justice and community-based agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3843">A new programme of group interventions commenced in January 2009, replacing the Sex Offender Programme initiated in 1994 and concluded last year.  The programme, "Building Better Lives", is available in Arbour Hill Prison.  It comprises three modules: "Exploring Better Lives",  "Practising Better Lives", and "Maintaining Better Lives".</p>
            <p eId="para_3844">The programme allows more responsive and flexible delivery of rehabilitation services to a greater number of offenders. The interventions take greater account of individual risk, needs and capacity, with higher risk offenders, for example, spending longer on offence-based work where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_3845">It is expected that the programme will be fully operational by end 2010 and will deliver interventions with up to 60 offenders each year.  To date, thirteen offenders have completed the first module and another eight offenders are currently participating.  One offender has completed the second module while eight offenders have commenced it.</p>
            <p eId="para_3846">With regard to the Sex Offender Programme which ran from 1994 to 2008, eight offenders completed the programme in 2005, eight offenders in 2006, seven offenders in 2007 and eight offenders in 2008. This intensive programme took eleven months to complete and over its lifetime a total of 136 sex offenders completed the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3847">Prison-based therapeutic interventions with convicted sex offenders also include one-to-one interventions, interventions by approved in-reach services and interventions available to prisoners generally.</p>

Under the Act it is also an offence to supply such a device to a prisoner.  The penalties for such an offence, on summary conviction, include a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. It is Irish Prison Service policy to report and hand over seizures of mobile phones to the Gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_3851">Since the inception of the legislation 65 people have received prison sentences arising from committing this offence. On 25th September, 2009, (the latest date for which statistics of this nature are currently available from the Irish Prison Service)  there were 7 people serving custodial sentences for this offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3852">Cell and area searches for contraband such as mobile phones take place in all prisons on a daily basis.  These include random, targeted and intelligence led searches.  These searches have been particularly effective and local intelligence indicates that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system.  Details of mobile seizures are set out in the table below and it is important to note that a large percentage of these seizures are not directly from prisoners but are instead retrieved at entry point or before they get to the prisoner population.  This is as a direct consequence of newly introduced security measures.  Airport style scanners and x-ray machines are in operation at the entrances of all the relevant closed prisons.  Details of mobile seizures for 2008 and recent figures for 2009 are set out in the table below.</p>

            <p eId="para_3902">A total of €41.8m, the bulk of which relates to the cost of the site, which was largely offset by the sale of surplus prison lands at Shanganagh, County Dublin has been expended to end August 2009 on site acquisition costs, professional fees, site preparation and engineering surveys, landscaping and security work.  As is the case with all major infrastructure projects a comprehensive set of geological, engineering and archaeological surveys were conducted at the site.  These essential preliminary site surveys will help to reduce the overall construction programme once a contract is signed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3903">In June of this year the Government re-affirmed its commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, Kilsallaghan, County Dublin and approved the launching of a new tendering process for the construction of a more affordable and better value prison campus at Thornton.  The aim is to provide good quality, regime focussed accommodation with appropriate support and rehabilitation facilities to prepare prisoners for re-integration back into society.  The new facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners in a range of security settings.</p>
            <p eId="para_3904">The development will now proceed on a phased basis with Phase one comprising essential basic preliminary works required for the development including the construction of the access route and perimeter wall.   It is intended that this work will proceed in the short term on the basis of separate contracts.  The tender documentation and scope of works are currently being drafted. It is anticipated that work on Phase one will commence towards the end of this year or early next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3905">While Phase one work is in progress the procurement process for the buildings and other facilities that will make up the new prison campus will be examined and finalised in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines for capital projects.  The objective is to complete the design and procurement process for the main prison complex while the construction of the phase one work is underway.  While an outline design plan has been prepared, work is ongoing on more detailed design plans which are required for the tendering process.  The two phase approach means that once a contract is signed for Phase two -the main prison development — the fact that the preliminary works envisaged by Phase one will have already have been completed will allow for construction to commence immediately on the main prison buildings within a secured perimeter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3906">The development of the new prison campus at Thornton Hall is a complex project which is governed by Department of Finance and EU procurement guidelines.  The guidelines set out a range of actions that must take place prior to inviting tenders for the project. The Irish Prison Service is being assisted in this work by the National Development Finance Agency.  It is intended to invite tenders for the construction of the Phase 2 — the main prison development — next year.  I would expect the new prison to be operational within 3 years of the signing of a contract for Phase 2.</p>

            <p eId="para_3908">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, which relates to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and finally to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_3909">I am informed by the Garda authorities that, up to 30 September, 2009, 1,378 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 1,025 to children.  In addition, three civil orders (in respect of adults) and three behaviour orders (in respect of children) have been issued by the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_3910">In setting up the regime the intention was that these interventions — warnings, good behaviour contracts and referrals to the Juvenile Diversion Programme — would address the problem behaviour.  It is only if they fail that a court order will be applied for.  Conversely, if they succeed, there will be no need to apply to the courts for an order.  Where warnings or good behaviour contracts do not succeed in altering a person's behaviour, however, they will culminate in ASBOs being sought by the Garda authorities from the courts.</p>

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.  The position in the State of the person concerned will now be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

            <p eId="para_3919">The person concerned was informed, by letter dated 24 October 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.

Namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.</p>
            <p eId="para_3920">By correspondence dated 9 July 2009, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the person concerned by her legal representative.

            <p eId="para_3921">Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 2 September 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to leave the State by 3 October 2009 or failing that, present herself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 6 October 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_3922">I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for temporary leave to remain in the State and for Subsidiary Protection, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport her is justified.</p>
            <p eId="para_3923">The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>

            <p eId="para_3935">All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that an explanation for a discrepancy between the information given by the person in question on his Form 8 and the information contained on the birth affidavit submitted was requested from the person concerned on 17 September, 2009 and to date this explanation has not been received. On receipt of the documentation requested further processing of the application will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_3936">The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3937">There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

The case involves the abduction of the child of an Irish citizen.

Diplomatic staff from our Embassy and the Embassy of France in Budapest were present in Boconad on that occasion to observe proceedings and provide consular assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3951">The Hungarian authorities subsequently issued a search warrant in respect of the child's mother but to date she or the child have not been found.  The Embassy is maintaining close contact with the Hungarian police.</p>

I hope to receive this in the near future with a view to rolling out a new programme early next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4038">My Department operates a Walks Scheme for the development, enhancement and maintenance of waymarked ways and priority walks.  It does not operate, as the Deputy suggests, on the basis of compensating farmers for allowing access to walkers — rather, it provides for limited payments to landowners for carrying out essential maintenance works on trails crossing their properties.</p>
            <p eId="para_4039">This Scheme has been developed within my Department in consultation with Comhairle na Tuaithe. It was introduced in 2008, and currently operates on 18 trails.</p>
            <p eId="para_4040">This is the first managed maintenance programme for walks and trails and the evidence is that the Scheme is working very well.  In this context, the Deputy should note that there is a significantly higher standard of maintenance on trails where the Scheme is in operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4041">Figures provided by Fáilte Ireland are very encouraging with over 500,000 walkers visiting Ireland in 2008.  These figures also indicate that the numbers of walkers visiting the country are increasing year-on-year, despite the difficulties in some areas of tourism.  This is particularly welcome news as it justifies the efforts to date in developing this natural resource and demonstrates conclusively the economic arguments in favour of encouraging walkers to visit Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_4055">The Government decided in February 2006 that the Community Welfare Service would transfer to the Department from the Health Service Executive to administer the  Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. Provision has been made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Acts 2007 and 2008 for the transfer of the administration of the SWA scheme from the HSE to the Department. These provisions are subject to a  Commencement Order.</p>
            <p eId="para_4056">A considerable amount of preparatory work, to allow for the transfer, has been completed but progress has been stalled due to industrial relations issues. Following consultation between the Department and the Health Sector Management the Labour Relations Commission was asked to intervene. A meeting of the parties took place on 22 September in the LRC and further meetings are planned for October. The management side's intention is to reach a collective agreement with the unions as soon as is practical so that the transfer can be implemented as early as possible in 2010. Discussions have also taken place with the unions representing the staff in the Department in relation to the transfer proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_4057">The integration of the Community Welfare Service into the Department will result in a more coordinated approach to the provision of service to the public and to the removal of duplication of work effort by staff. The transfer will not lead to any changes in the  exercise of discretion by Community Welfare Officers when dealing with applications for Supplementary Welfare Allowance. The flexibility and responsiveness which is inherent in the scheme will remain. I am anxious that every effort is now made to complete the  arrangements for the transfer in accordance with the Government decision. I am confident that the concerns of all the staff involved can now be dealt with.</p>

In general, the decision to grant an oral hearing can add 8 weeks on average to the total processing time.  Given the logistics involved in organising oral hearings in some 60 venues around the country, the average period from the date of referral for an oral hearing to the oral hearing appointment is of the order of 17 weeks.</p>

        <b>Deputy Seymour Crawford</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         the number of farming families that have applied for farm assist to date in 2009; the number of which have been finalised; the average allocation per family, specifically in the case of an individual, a couple and a family where children are involved; if she is satisfied that the present serious collapse in farm income is being taken into account by all of her personnel; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4112">Since 1 January 2009 a total of 1,986 applications for farm assist have been received in the Department.  Of these 1,191 have been awarded and are in payment.  Fifty nine claims were disallowed and 736 are awaiting a decision on their application.  Of the 1,191 claimants who were awarded farm assist this year, 522 have one or more children.</p>
            <p eId="para_4113">The total number of farm assist claims in payment at present is 8,383 and of these, 2,891 have children.  The average weekly payment is €221.07.</p>
            <p eId="para_4114">The investigation of claims for farm assist is undertaken by Social Welfare Inspectors who are very experienced in relation to the assessment of farming means.  They take into account the present downturn in the economy in estimating a farmer's likely income from farming in the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4115">Any farmer who is dissatisfied with a decision given on their claim may appeal that decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeal Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_4116">In recent years changes have been made to farm assist which means that it is now easier for low income farmers to qualify for support under the scheme.  For instance, in January of this year the rates of payment for the scheme were increased.   Improvements in the method of assessing earnings from insurable employment were also introduced in September 2007 which provides further gains for families claiming farm assist, where either spouse is also in insurable employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4117">Farm assist has brought about significant worthwhile improvements for low income farmers, particularly for those with children, making a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.</p>

            <p eId="para_4119">The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work. This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable. Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_4120">Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may apply for the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in the demand for their services. Generally, in assessing the means of a self-employed person, a Social Welfare Inspector will take into account the level of earnings in the preceding 12 months to determine their expected income in the following year. However, with the general downturn in the economy at present, it is accepted that earnings in the previous 12 months may not be representative of expected earnings in the coming year. The Social Welfare Inspector will take account of this fact in projecting future earnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_4121">There are no immediate plans to review the criteria for Jobseekers Allowance. Any such measure would have to be considered within a budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_4123">Rent supplement is payable to people who are unable to meet the cost of renting private accommodation. The supplement is intended as a short-term income support to eligible tenants whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs. There are currently nearly 90,800 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 23% since the end of December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_4124">Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that, after payment of rent, an eligible person has income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently €24, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4125">The assessment for the existing rent interest supplement provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Where a person, working up to 30 hours per week, has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity. A person accepted as having a long term housing need under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) may engage in full time employment and still qualify for rent supplement, subject to standard means assessment rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_4126">In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplement for extended periods. Over 32,600 people are getting a supplement for 18 months or more. For this reason, the rent supplement scheme has to be viewed in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_4127">The Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by the Department to the local authorities. Latest figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (DoEHLG) indicate that to date, local authorities have transferred 22,400 people from rent supplement to RAS or social housing since 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4128">The fact that there almost 90,800 people are receiving rent supplement indicates that the scheme is meeting need to a significant extent. However, the rent supplement scheme, including the means testing criteria, will be kept under review. The Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that RAS meets its objective of catering for those on long term rent supplementation while enabling rent supplement to return to its original role of a short-term income support and that local authorities are supported in providing a wide range of social housing supports for those with a long-term housing need.</p>

            <p eId="para_4132">I propose to take Questions Nos. 323 to 325, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4133">As the Deputy will be aware, the rates of child benefit have increased significantly since 2001 having trebled for the first two children and increased by over 185% for the third and subsequent children. Partly as a result of this and partly as a result of an increase in the number of eligible children, overall expenditure on child benefit grew from just under €965 million in 2001 to nearly €2.5 billion in 2008. The Government is proud to have been able to direct such substantial increases in financial support to all Irish families in recent years. However, given the scale of the current economic crisis, it is necessary to address all aspects of the public finances so as to ensure that they are sustainable and to ensure that fairness exists in the allocation of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4134">It is in this context that the Minister for Finance announced at the time of the Supplementary Budget in April 09 that the Government's intention to either subject child benefit to income tax or means-test it from 2010. To this end, the Minister asked the Commission on Taxation to consider the implications of taxing Child Benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_4135">In their respective reports, both the Commission on Taxation and The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes have put forward a wide range of proposals relating to my Department's schemes and services, including the child benefit scheme. While it is possible to achieve a more targeted approach through either the taxation or means testing of Child Benefit, these approaches have significantly differing implications for the practical implementation and the families involved. In their respective reports, both the Commission on Taxation and The Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes have put forward a wide range of proposals relating to my Department's schemes and services, including the child benefit scheme. While it is possible to achieve a more targeted approach through either the taxation or means testing of Child Benefit, these approaches have significantly differing implications for the practical implementation and the families involved. Issues regarding the definition of income, the implications for low income families and the impact on poverty traps need to be examined. The Government is now considering these proposals and implications will be mindful of the needs of families, particularly those on lower incomes when deciding on the various options in the forthcoming Budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_4137">The Department is committed to ensuring that claims are processed as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.  Over the past number of years a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented in the pension scheme area in Sligo.  Significant improvements have been achieved in claim processing times and backlogs have been eliminated.  Operational processes and procedures and the organisation of work are continually reviewed to ensure that processing capability is maximised.</p>
            <p eId="para_4138">From January 2009, new processing targets, based on processing 90% of claims, were introduced for all schemes.  The processing targets and average performance achieved to August 2009 for State Pension Contributory (SPC), State Pension Non Contributory (SPNC), State Pension Transition (SPT), Widow(er)'s Contributory Pensions (WCP) and Widow(er)'s Non Contributory Pension (WNCP) schemes are given in the following table.</p>

            <p eId="para_4464">Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4465">A total of 13,090 new applications for Carer's Allowance have been received this year to date (week end 2 October 2009). There are currently 2,175 applications for Carer's Allowance waiting decision. It is at decision stage when the Deciding Officer decides whether a person will be awarded full rate Carer's Allowance or half rate Carer's Allowance depending on their circumstances at that time. The average time to decide a claim for carer's allowance is currently 9.4 weeks. The processing target for Carer's Allowance is 90% of claims decided within 12 weeks. The figure achieved for the month of September 2009 was 80% of claims decided within 12 weeks. In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made. Delays can also arise if people applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim. Many applicants for carer's allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4466">The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands. The Department monitors available resources against workload on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring optimum processing times for claims.</p>

            <p eId="para_4623">I propose to take Questions Nos. 331 and 332 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4624">The Department has a continuous programme of process improvement initiatives underway aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology.  The simplification and reduction of application forms complements the introduction of more streamlined processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4625">The key principles underpinning the design of the Departments application forms are the use of clear and simple language, with consistent layout and presentation across both online and paper forms.  All application forms are designed to facilitate the use of scanning and automated processing.  This ensures that the application is processed as efficiently as possible and that customers receive their entitlement in a timely manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_4626">In addition, all primary application forms are available on the Department's website.  Applications for a number of schemes, e.g. State Pension (Contributory) and Household Benefits can be completed and submitted online.  This facility will be extended to other schemes in the coming months.  The objective is to enable people to access services at a time and place that best suits their needs.  The use of online application forms reduces the administrative burden for the customer and facilitates efficient processing of claims by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4627">I am satisfied that the initiatives underway in the Department, the improvements to processes and procedures supported by the redesign of application forms, and the Department's use of modern technology will deliver an improved and efficient service to customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_4629">The Respite Care Grant (RCG) is an annual payment made to all persons providing full-time care, regardless of means or PRSI contribution record, but subject to certain conditions.

            <p eId="para_4808">Under electoral law, local returning officers are responsible at a referendum for sending a polling information card (PIC) to every presidential elector (i.e. Irish citizens) whose name is on the register of electors; there are 3,078,032 such electors on the register of electors which came into force on 15 February 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4809">At the recent referendum, the PIC was issued with the Statement for the Information of Voters, which was prescribed by the Oireachtas, as a single document with the PIC being detachable from the statement.  In order to assist local returning officers with the addressing and issuing of the PICs, the Office of Public Works put in place a central contract for this work and returning officers were responsible for supplying the relevant register of electors data to the printers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4810">Possession of a PIC does not confer a right to vote. It was stressed to local returning officers and polling station staff in written guidance from my Department in advance of the referendum that they must refuse to issue a ballot paper to any individual who is recorded on the register of electors as being a non-Irish citizen.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_4818">In recent years significant efforts have been made to ensure that all new construction projects, including the delivery of local authority housing stock, are designed and built to high energy efficiency and sustainable development standards.  To that end, Part L of the current Building Regulations requires that all new housing, including social housing:</p>
            <p eId="para_4819">has 40% lower heat energy demand than previous buildings standards;</p>
            <p eId="para_4820">requires the installation of boilers with not less than 86% energy efficiency (condensing boilers);</p>
            <p eId="para_4821">requires the mandatory use of renewable energy sources (a minimum of 10 kilowatt hours per square metre per annum).</p>
            <p eId="para_4822">Ireland has become the first country to include a mandatory provision for renewable energy sources in its building code.  My Department is committed to building on this success by pushing beyond these recommended levels in the 2010 Building Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4823">As part of a national programme to improve the energy efficiency of the social housing stock, a range of initiatives has been introduced to deliver improved energy performance and to address, in large part, issues of fuel poverty in local authority housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_4824">Following a call for proposals for new social housing projects, my Department has, this year, approved eight new construction projects that are designed to go beyond the current building regulations and will achieve a minimum Building Energy Rating of A2 for each dwelling.  These Towards Carbon Neutral <i> </i>demonstration projects will serve to further the local authority’s knowledge and experience in the design, construction and operation of high performing energy efficient social housing.  Following this programme, it is intended that the successful, viable processes and technologies identified in the demonstration projects would be mainstreamed into general social housing provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_4825">My Department is also concerned to improve the existing local authority housing stock.  Two new initiatives were announced earlier this year which further support this Government's objective of improving energy efficiency and tackling the issues of fuel poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_4826">Firstly, my Department has allocated some €20 million to facilitate local authorities in improving the energy efficiency of local authority apartment complexes and vacant local authority dwellings.  This operates on a co-funded, grant per unit basis, under which my Department provides funding for 75% of the cost of the works, subject to a maximum grant of €15,000, to bring vacant properties up to a Building Energy Rating of C1.  In the event that a property does not achieve a C1 rating following remedial works, authorities may instead claim 50% of the cost, again subject to a maximum grant of €15,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_4827">In parallel with the Towards Carbon Neutral initiative for new construction projects, my Department is also supporting a number of demonstration projects for the retrofitting of energy efficiency improvements to existing local authority dwellings, with a view to again building up the expertise and experience of local authorities in delivering better energy returns in their stock.  To that end, the Department has set aside a fund of €5 million to support a number of projects around the country.  Two projects, Glover Court in Dublin City and two Georgian buildings in Limerick City, are already at an advanced stage of planning and design.</p>
            <p eId="para_4828">Since 2004, my Department has provided €125 million to support the installation of central heating and other energy efficiency measures in almost 26,000 local authority homes that were without any form of central heating.  This programme is due for completion this year, with a further 2,100 installations being undertaken at a cost of €14 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4829">Local authorities will, of course, themselves continue to fund a range of housing maintenance and improvement activities from their own resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4830">Beyond the measures and programmes already outlined to improve energy efficiency and address issues of fuel poverty, my Department is also represented on the Inter-departmental/agency group on Energy Affordability.  This group, under the auspices of the Department of Communications, Energy, and Natural Resources, provides an important vehicle for Departments and Agencies to share information and co-ordinate activities in the fuel poverty arena to best effect.</p>

Because of its designation, rock-armouring works of the river bank such as those proposed would be considered a notifiable activity, and therefore Ministerial consent must be sought to ensure that no works are carried out  that would result in damage to the conservation interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_4837">My Department has granted permission, subject to a number of conditions, for similar works in the Feale in the past.

            <p eId="para_4851">The National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) was established in 1995 to ensure that Ireland holds the equivalent of 90 days strategic stocks that can be released to consumers and industry in the event of an oil supply disruption or shortage.  This is in line with Ireland's international obligations, as well as being strategically important for Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4852">NORA ensures that Ireland meets its 90 day stock-holding obligation through a combination of stocks held in Ireland and other EU Member States, and through short-term commercial contracts to purchase oil in the event of an oil supply disruption.  Stocks held by industry in Ireland also form part of Ireland's 90 day stockholding.  NORA receives no Exchequer funding.  Its activities are funded by a levy imposed on certain oil products in Ireland and charged to oil supply companies.  In 2008, NORA received income of €81m from this levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4853">The Government's Energy Policy Framework 2007 — 2020 committed to the re-balancing of Ireland's strategic oil stocks, in favour of stocks held on the island of Ireland.  In 2009 my Department published a Review of Security of Commercial Oil Supply in Ireland, which was undertaken by international oil consultants Purvin and Gertz, and Irish energy consultants Byrne O'Cleirigh.  The report noted that Ireland currently holds one of the lowest proportions of oil stocks within its own borders of all EU Member States.  It also noted that Ireland is particularly vulnerable to supply disruptions because of our island status and the fact that 45% of our oil imports are shipped through Dublin port.</p>
            <p eId="para_4854">In light of these key strategic factors, and NORA's need to maintain a firm financial basis for its ongoing and future activities, in June 2009, I introduced the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007 (Returns and Levy) Regulations.  The purpose of these Regulations was to increase the NORA levy from 1 cent to 2 cent per litre of fuel purchased from 1st October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4855">The income from the levy will ensure that NORA has sufficient funds to effectively manage Ireland's strategic oil stocks.  It will ensure that Ireland continues to have 90 days of strategic oil stocks available and accessible in the event of a major oil supply disruption.</p>

            <p eId="para_4859">Earlier this year I announced measures to encourage the on-site generation of electricity from wind turbines and other renewable technologies in homes and farms across Ireland.  Among the measures is a guaranteed price of 19 cent per kilowatt hour for electricity produced and exported to the national grid.  This feed-in tariff will apply to the first 4,000 microgeneration installations countrywide over the next 3 years.  Local generators will have the ability to be paid by ESB for electricity that is surplus to their own requirements and exported back to the grid.</p>
            <p eId="para_4860">Financial assistance has however been made available to a number of sites which will be studied in field trials in 2009 and 2010. The aim of the trials is to, among other things, collect data on the performance and effectiveness of micro generation in the Irish context.  The field trials are intended to assist in resolving certain technical issues including the requirements for qualification and certification of technologies and defining the necessary arrangements for qualification, certification and training of installers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4861">The purchase of wind turbines by companies became eligible for accelerated capital allowances in September 2009 through Statutory Instrument 393 of 2009.  To be eligible for the accelerated capital allowance, the turbines must comply with the eligibility criteria set out in the statutory instrument.  In particular, they must have a rating of greater than 5kW and be for the purpose of generation of electricity primarily for on-site use by the company.</p>

            <p eId="para_4883">Regulation 43 of SI 786/2007 sets out the rules applying both to the prescribing of "prescription only" veterinary medicines by veterinary practitioners and to the dispensing of veterinary prescriptions by veterinary practitioners and others (i.e. by pharmacists and, in the limited circumstances specified in paragraph 3(iii) of Schedule 1, by Licensed Merchants).  This Regulation lays down the criteria to be met before a veterinarian may prescribe medicines.  Schedule 3 to the Regulations (as amended by SI 182/2009) lays down the specifications for a written prescription, which is a mandatory requirement (with very limited exceptions in the case of certain pet animals).</p>
            <p eId="para_4884">With regard to the dispensing of veterinary medicines, the Regulations enable farmers and others to purchase their POM medicines either from the veterinarian who prescribed them or, on production of a veterinary prescription, from a pharmacy or, in the case of medicinal products, such as intramammaries or vaccines, from a Licensed Merchant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4885">It should also, of course, be borne in mind that a significant body of products (e.g. wormers and some vaccines) are available ‘off prescription', meaning that they can be purchased as required without a prescription from Licensed Merchants, pharmacies or vets.</p>

              <b>1 INTRODUCTION</b>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_4910">The Minister for Education and Science wishes to inform management authorities of Primary, Secondary, Community and Comprehensive Schools of the introduction of the Cycle to Work Scheme. The scheme will apply to teachers, special needs assistants, clerical officers, caretakers and child care workers paid on payrolls operated by the Department of Education and Science as paymaster.</p>
            <p eId="para_4911">Legislation was introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 which allows an employer to incur the expense of providing an employee with a new bicycle<sup>1</sup> without the employee being liable for benefit-in-kind taxation.  The Legislation also permits the benefit-in-kind tax exemption to apply in the context of salary sacrifice, that is, where an employee agreed to forego or sacrifice part of his/her salary in lieu of the provision of new bicycle by the employer. The employee will not pay tax, PRSI, income levy or pension related deduction on the remuneration sacrificed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4912"><sup>1</sup>The scheme also applies to safety equipment relating to cycling.</p>
            <p eId="para_4913">The scheme allows an employer to purchase a new bicycle and/or bicycle safety equipment up to a value of €1,000 once every 5 years on behalf of an employee.</p>
            <p eId="para_4914">A guidance note on the scheme including a series of Questions and Answers provided by the Revenue Commissioners can be found at: http://www.revenue.ie/en/practitioner/law/bik-exemption-for-bicycles.pdf</p>
            <p eId="para_4915">The scheme applies only to new bicycles and bicycle safety equipment purchased from approved suppliers. [A list of suppliers is available on the OPW web site at http://www.opw.ie/en/OurBusinessUnits/GovernmentSuppliesAgency/Cycle-to-WorkScheme/. Note that the list may be limited at the outset but shops and suppliers may apply to join at any stage.]</p>
            <p eId="para_4916">For the purpose of the Cycle to Work Scheme, any reference to employer in this circular can be taken as a direct reference to the Department of Education and Science, as paymaster. Any reference to employee relates to the individual primary or second level teacher, special needs assistant, clerical officer, caretaker or child care worker.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_4918">Salary sacrifice by an employee in respect of the bicycle will be acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners as being effective for tax purposes under the following conditions:</p>

         if he will reconsider his decision in 2008 to abolish the support service grants to Protestant fee paying schools, especially those in the Border region and more rural areas; his views on whether the cutbacks have put pressure on these schools and that the further proposals by the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programme are causing stress and annoyance to the minority community; his further views on the fact that from the beginning of free education or the establishment of this State that the special needs of a minority group was dealt with sympathetically; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_5146">I wish to reassure the Deputy that I, along with my colleagues in Government, recognise the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant background  can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos.  The Deputy will be aware that I have met with representatives of both the Church of Ireland Board of Education and the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland to discuss the funding position of Protestant schools and the background to the decision in the October budget to remove certain grants from fee-charging Protestant schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_5147">I have emphasised that no changes have been made to the block grant, which is expected to be €6.5 million in this school year. It covers capitation, tuition  and boarding costs and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee established by the churches concerned. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5148">I wish to advise the Deputy that my officials have met representatives from the  Secondary Education Committee to discuss future funding arrangements for  Protestant schools. In this context, I have expressed my willingness to consider any proposals that might be made to my Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to more effectively meet the twin objectives of access for individuals and sustaining the schools that they wish to attend, particularly those in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5149">The October Budget implemented changes in how all fee-charging schools are  treated in relation to the number of publicly funded teaching posts they are  allocated. With effect from 1 January 2009, teachers in fee-charging schools  are allocated at a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1, which is a point higher than  allocations in non-fee-charging post-primary schools.  In view of the challenging  economic circumstances that we are facing, I am not in a position to reverse this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_5150">This decision is justified on the basis that schools which have access to fees  as an income source are in a better position to maintain services at a time  when the public finances are under such severe pressure. Fee-charging schools  can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.</p>
            <p eId="para_5151">I will continue to work with representatives of the Protestant educational  sector to ensure that State funding made available to the Protestant community  is targeted in the fairest way possible to meet the needs of their children and  their schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_5152">Planned expenditure levels for my Department will be considered as part of the  Estimates and budgetary process for 2010. This will include consideration of  the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure  Programmes, and the decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for  the Government.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.</p>

            <p eId="para_5154">Under the student maintenance grant schemes, students who are entering approved  courses for the first time are eligible for financial assistance where they  satisfy the relevant conditions as to residence, means, age, nationality and  previous academic attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5155">A mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on  the 1st January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.  Mature students are then categorised as either independent mature students or  mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his/her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.  Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</p>
            <p eId="para_5156">The Student Support Bill will provide the Minister with the power to regulate  for different classes of applicants. This power would enable me, if there are  compelling reasons and adequate resources to do so, to consider extending the  circumstances where a student could be assessed without reference to parental  income.</p>
            <p eId="para_5157">My Department is currently reviewing the circumstances where a means assessment independent of parental income would be appropriate and in the context of the Programme of legislative and administrative reform of student grants and the development of a new unified scheme of student support, is undertaking further consultation on this and related matters with a view to establishing the particular circumstances where assessment as an independent student might be warranted.</p>
            <p eId="para_5158">Any extension of the provision of assessment as an independent student will  have to be carefully considered to ensure it is highly targeted at very  specific circumstances where students can demonstrate that they have been  genuinely self-supporting and living independently for a number of years.</p>
