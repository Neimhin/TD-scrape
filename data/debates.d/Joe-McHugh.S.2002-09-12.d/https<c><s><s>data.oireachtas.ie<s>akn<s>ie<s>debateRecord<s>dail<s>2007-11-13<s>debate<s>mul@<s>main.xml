          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_10">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">Since the inaugural plenary meeting on 15 February 2007, several meetings have taken place with the social partners in relation to the implementation of Towards 2016.  I attended and addressed the ICTU biennial conference on 4 July at which I emphasised the basis for confidence in Ireland's economic outlook while, at the same time, warning against complacency.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">Regarding the basis for confidence, I referred in particular to the ESRI's report on the social impact of our economic development.  It concluded, among other findings, that living standards have risen for almost everyone, the fall in unemployment, in particular long-term unemployment, has made a decisive impact on social exclusion, people are now more likely to work in a better job than their parents and levels of deprivation have significantly declined for all social groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">These achievements, and others like them, are not accidental, they are the outcome of good government and sound policy choices taken by a variety of stakeholders in society, mediated in many cases through social partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">Regarding the need to guard against complacency, I drew attention in my speech to the globalised setting within which the economy operates.  Interest rates, energy prices and competition from emerging economies provide warning signals that success cannot be taken for granted.  Minimising inflationary impulses, in so far as we can, is especially important.  There is acceptance on all sides of the social partnership framework that we cannot and must not go back to the wage-price inflationary spiral of the early 1980s.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">Regarding the ongoing engagement with social partners on the implementation of Towards 2016, the most recent meeting of the steering group was held on 8 October.  The agenda included a presentation on the housing commitments under Towards 2016, a presentation on progress for people with disabilities and proposals for the North-South consultative forum.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">The meeting also considered the progress report on the national reform programme under the Lisbon Agenda which is being progressed within the overall Towards 2016 framework.  The report was submitted to the European Commission and laid before the House in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">The latest plenary meeting took place on 8 November 2007 at Farmleigh House.  The Government was represented by me, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Agenda items included a pre-budget presentation from the Department of Finance.  The third progress report under Towards 2016 was also circulated at the meeting and has been made available on my Department's website.  As is the normal practice, all papers and copies of the progress report have been laid before the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">The steering group will continue to have overall responsibility for managing the implementation of the agreement as it applies to the wider non-pay issues.  Quarterly plenary meetings of the social partner pillars will continue, as has been the practice over recent years.  The programme for Government commits that "arrangements for representation of environmental issues in Social Partnership will be considered in the course of the review of Towards 2016 which will take place in 2008."  Any change to the structure of social partnership must be carefully considered and the Government has previously identified clear and specific criteria against which applications to join the social partnership process are considered.  These include that organisations requesting social partner status be national and representative in nature; that they have the capacity to meet the demands and obligations that arise as part of this participation; and that they will add to the capacity of the social partnership process to address issues effectively.  In addition, any organisations would be required to formally endorse the Towards 2016 agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">In line with this commitment in the programme for Government, the issue will be considered further in the review of Towards 2016 in 2008 and related commitments to enhance the role of Comhar and establish a climate change commission.  In respect of the application by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association to be included in social partnership, the Government fully recognises the central importance of the small business sector to Ireland's economy.  It is deeply committed to sustaining its support for enterprise through a competitive regulatory environment, prudent fiscal policy, as well as the comprehensive range of State supports provided by organisations in the field, such as the City and County Enterprise Boards, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and FÁS.  The Small Firms Association represents small businesses in social partnership.  Participation in the pay negotiations will continue to be confined to organisations with an established role in pay and industrial relations matters and will not be extended beyond the current participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">Regarding correspondence received from the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on the question of inflation and mortgage interest relief, I wrote to ICTU on 14 September 2007 reaffirming the Government's resolve to tackle the root causes of inflation, in so far as it is within our capacity to do so.  The General Secretary raised the question of increasing the ceiling on mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers and those who bought a house in the past seven years.  In response I confirmed that the commitments in the programme for Government in this respect are set within the context of the budget.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance announced on 3 July 2007 his intention that budget 2008 will provide for a further increase in mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers of €10,000 for a single person and €20,000 for couples or widowed persons.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_21">The Taoiseach has given a long reply.  It is generally recognised that the social partnership has been beneficial for the country because it has dampened the need for strike action in many cases.  The structure originally envisaged, however, is not able to cope with what we face now.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">Chaos is being caused by the Dublin Bus strike in what is a growing city with an increasing population, where commuters are hard-pressed to get to work in our high pressure society.  They need new cross-city and orbital bus routes and services.  When the system fails to find agreement with its workforce causing chaos on the streets it significantly disrupts people's lives.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Dublin Bus dispute, leaving aside its minutiae, is the failure of a regulatory regime to provide for people's need for services given the physical and human expansion of this city?  Leaving aside the minutiae of the dispute does the Taoiseach agree that we are faced with a symptom of a failed regulatory regime?  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</p>
            <p eId="para_23">People who require transport services generally do not mind who provides them as long as they are cost efficient, safe, effective and get them to and from work without disruption.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the liberalisation of transport in Dublin and across the country has failed in this regard?  Deputy Mary O'Rourke, who was Minister in 2000, introduced proposals for the liberalisation of these routes that were abandoned just before the election.  There is clearly a demand from many people for new services and this disruption has occurred because the virtual monopoly that is <i>in situ</i> has failed to find agreement in its workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">Is this matter the symptom of a failed regulatory regime?  What does the Taoiseach propose regarding the continued liberalisation of the bus transport market?  It takes three years for a private sector applicant to get a licence, given the chaos in the Department of Transport.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_3">
            <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
            <p eId="para_25">Deputy Kenny will be aware that the Taoiseach does not have responsibility for issues affecting line Ministers.  The Taoiseach may answer in so far as the Deputy's questions relate to social partnership.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_26">That is what my questions relate to.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_27">On the regulatory situation, the Department of Transport has received union agreement in recent years on the issuing of additional licences, especially for new routes.  We have not started issuing licences and creating competition on existing routes but there are many new services.  The total liberalisation of the market, which would open it to competition, is under ongoing consideration but many problems exist in terms of getting agreement from those in the transport sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">There is a progressive movement of new services and Dublin Bus and CIE have agreed to move to new areas of the city and implement cross city routes, which have gone well.  In fairness to Dublin Bus, incidents of industrial action at the company have been rare in recent years and I cannot recall when the last serious, all-out dispute occurred.  There have been sporadic disputes at various stations, such as the one taking place at the moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">I see this dispute as neither regulatory in nature nor pertaining to social partnership.  Conflicts of this type should not happen but occur from time to time.  I deplore the hardship that has been inflicted on the travelling public as a result of this dispute at Dublin Bus.  I recognise that genuine issues are involved in this matter but that is not the point.  The issues have been through the conciliation process at the Labour Relations Commission and are subject to a Labour Court recommendation.  The issues have been through all the relevant strands of the process and a clear decision has been made.  We know that recommendations of this type from the Labour Court are not binding.  Substituting old-fashioned conflict for sensible negotiation and agreement benefits neither the company nor its employees.  On the contrary, in a world where customers expect other options, as Deputy Kenny said, disputes like this are self-defeating and all sides should recognise that.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">I am sure that creative solutions can be found to this dispute, like any other dispute.  In reply to Deputy Kenny's question, I urge the parties involved to use the highly effective industrial relations machinery that is available to resolve the matter.  The issue has been through the conciliation process at the Labour Relations Commission and is the subject of a Labour Court recommendation.  The parties involved should use these creative solutions to bring about a quick resolution and I hope that can be achieved as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">The broader question is how the management of Dublin Bus can harness demand to its own advantage, leaving aside the private sector companies that wish to enter the market.  Dublin Bus should take a proactive approach in this.  We saw what happened across the water where Margaret Thatcher's Government believed the way right of forcing the hand of the state municipal bus services was to privatise the routes.  That has been in dramatic reverse for the past five years, however, because the private sector was only interested in the lucrative routes at lucrative times.  It was not interested in providing a service for 17 or 18 hours a day.  This is something to which I have never been attracted, but we would force that upon ourselves if we did not have a sensible, progressive approach in terms of public bus services.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_32">Will the Taoiseach discuss with the Minister for Transport the fact that the system that operates in that Department is simply crazy in terms of freeing up and giving an efficient response to applications for licences for new services, whether on existing routes or new ones?  It takes an operator at least three years to get a licence and that is unacceptable.  In the sprawling conurbations of this city, we should expect better.  We have come a long way since the says when everybody had to go to Busáras to get a bus.  Aircoach and others showed what can be done.  However, the system that operates within the Department of Transport for issuing of licences is antiquated, inefficient and lacks the professionalism we expect in a modern country.</p>
            <p eId="para_33">At the IBEC biennial presidential dinner on 26 October, the Taoiseach rightly said that arresting the trend of deterioration in our cost competitiveness in recent years would be key to future growth.  He went on to say that a key consideration when we come to the next phase of pay negotiations under Towards 2016 would be its application to the public sector as much as the private sector.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is seated beside the Taoiseach, is only in the job a wet week and has already received an increase of €25,000.  Good luck to the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">Does the Taoiseach not agree that these awards are disproportionate to the extent that they are not comparable to any private sector area?  The only people to whom Ministers can be compared are other Ministers, whether in Britain or another European country.  It seems the body reviewing their pay looked to New Zealand and Australia for some reason.  On my way to Brussels on Tuesday of last week, I noticed in <i>The Economist</i> a beautiful table showing our small country with its well paid Ministers.

            <p eId="para_36">The pay increases were disproportionate and based on a false premise.  I ask the Taoiseach to comment on this.  It will be the first time he has had an opportunity to do so in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_37">Some people are under pressure as a result of the news coming from the United States of further issues arising from the crisis surrounding sub-prime lending.  The Taoiseach is telling everybody to tighten their belts at a time when members of the Cabinet have awarded themselves — accepted, it was an independent recommendation — pay increases ranging from €25,000 to €38,000.  Does he think this was realistic in the current circumstances, given that when I was a member of Cabinet, our first decision was to refuse an increase on that basis?</p>
            <p eId="para_38">The Taoiseach referred to FÁS in the context of social partnership.  He knows well that FÁS is spending some €1 billion a year.  One of the critical issues facing all of us is the necessity to upskill and retrain workers.  This is a sizeable challenge.  Does the Taoiseach consider that FÁS, under its current structure, has the capacity to meet this challenge given that there is an increasing concern about major manufacturing firms having to move abroad to lower cost regions?  Is FÁS up to getting best value for €1 billion of taxpayers' money under its current structure?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_39">There are three questions.  With regard to the first, I will raise the issue of CIE with the Minister for Transport.  I know discussions have been ongoing and the unions, management and the Department have made progress in liberalising the regime with regard to the relevant Act and having a more open way of giving licences for new routes and areas.  They have not fully liberalised the market because it would create direct competition.  I will never say they cannot make more progress as that could be done.  The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, moved the negotiations a long way in trying to progress the issue.  I will raise with the Minister the matter of the delays as there is no reason for a three-year delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">I made a number of points outside the House on the issue of pay.  The reality is that when anybody sees a very large increase that covers a long period, it creates difficulties, and I accept that point.  The review body covered a period from 2000 but it should have been covered the period from 2000 to 2004.  That was not done up to 2004 but from 2000 to the current period.  It benchmarked this rise against what it believed were comparable grades in the private sector, which is what the review body does.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">The impression constantly given is that the Government dreamed up these increases and implemented them itself.  No matter how many times it is mentioned, that is the argument that is made.  The review body has been there since 1969 and it periodically, originally on a four-year basis, carries out an assessment.  It is an independent assessment, carried out by independent people, and is based on the principles of comparability that are an established feature of public pay determination.  That is accepted by the social partners and most other people.</p>
            <p eId="para_42">The assessment reflects trends in the private sector at senior levels.  For example, it does not just take into account politicians in New Zealand or Australia but the trends across private sector grades.  The reality is the private sector grades have moved up substantially over the past seven years.  I listened to the views of ICTU and others on this issue when the Government was considering this proposal.  It decided that we should not take the increase immediately but rather over a two-year period, which is what has happened a number of times.  They have been phased in.</p>
            <p eId="para_43">Deputy Kenny stated he was a member of a Government that pressed back these recommendations.  I too have been a member of Governments that have done that but they have always taken the increase anyway.  They either take a sliding scale or refer them but they have always been taken.  There are a number of examples where there have been sliding scales but none of the proposals since 1969 has been rejected.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">With regard to the comparisons with French President Sarkozy and others, the Deputy and I know all the arrangements these people have.  The position is similar with much of their tax arrangements as they do not operate a system of transparency.  They have all kinds of allowances and many ways of implementing them.  I would like somebody to put all their arrangements up front.  Not only do most of these people have permanent and weekend residences but they also have holiday residences.  They have different rules where they are the beneficiaries of prolonged holidays, yachts and homes.  We do not and should not have those regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">Most of the people mentioned by the Deputy would not pay for a cup of tea from one end of the year to the other because they have catering staff in their homes and can use jets for social as well as other occasions.  They are not comparable conditions so we should not use them.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">It would not be hard for a member of the media to write a glowing article about how poverty-stricken we are compared to other countries.  I suppose I will have to wait for that.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">The review body discounted the comparable salaries in the private sector by 15% to reflect the value of public service increases.  I would gladly forego the increase to a future date, as happened before, if I believed it would make a whit of difference but it would probably be reported on page 99 of the newspaper.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The reality is that an independent body examined this and came up with an assessment that we decided to phase in over a period.  The 2000 agreement is seven years old, so the increase is less than 3% per annum, with the 7.5% paid to us in the interim period in 2005.  We have extended it by two years and it was agreed in the report that the next review would be in four years time.  There is an 11 year period, therefore, with one increase.  Admittedly it is a large increase, I am not arguing that, but it is an 11 year increase of just under 3% over the seven years.  That is the position.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">On FÁS, I totally agree that the updating of skills will be a major part of the future of industry.  That has been highlighted in many reports.  In the national development plan a huge amount has been set aside for the upskilling of the existing workforce.  We have a large workforce and this year has been a good year for manufacturing industry.  Some other sectors may have been under pressure but it was a good year for manufacturing.  Its future success depends on its ability to upskill quickly with good equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">I do not deal with FÁS on a daily basis, as I did in the past, but the organisation also has an input from sectors tied to third level education and should be able to do this.  The skills evaluation report earlier this year highlighted some of what we must do in terms of training.  FÁS is a large organisation with many employees and it should be up to doing it.  The necessary efforts should be put in by FÁS because it has the budget, the network of offices and training centres and associations with industry and third level institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">Can the system be improved?  The skills evaluation report showed that we must continually retrain, upskilling our people, if we are to stay at the cutting edge of new technology.  FÁS is not the only organisation doing that, in-company training in the private sector is hugely important for those companies spending large amounts in the manufacturing, pharmaceutical and other sectors.  That requires resources in the public sector.  FÁS is a suitable public sector organisation for this but it should take full account of the skills evaluation report.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_17">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_57">Yesterday morning and again this morning, 60,000 Dublin commuters could not get a bus to work.  If this dispute in Dublin Bus escalates, more people will be unable to get a bus to work.  On top of that there are reports that there may be strikes in Aer Lingus.  The Taoiseach is responding to questions on social partnership, which is supposed to resolve those disputes and ensure we do not have industrial action over matters such as rosters, tea breaks and changes in work practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">As a result of these disputes, are we witnessing the unravelling of the social partnership process?  Has the Taoiseach contributed to such unravelling?  I note the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance asked for wage restraint at Farmleigh last week.  Does the Taoiseach not have a hard neck to ask the social partners for wage restraint in circumstances in which he is not prepared to exercise it himself?  What does he have to say in respect of the comment made by Mr. David Begg, who is not known for overstatement, to the effect that the Taoiseach's plea for wage restraint lacked credibility on foot of the ministerial pay increases?  Is it not the case that the industrial disputes that are beginning to emerge and which resemble an echo from the past are, to some extent, an indicator of a worsening industrial relations climate to which the Taoiseach has contributed personally?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_18">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_59">As Deputy Gilmore is aware, that is not the case.  Social partnership has been tremendously successful in avoiding unnecessary disputes but has not eliminated them.  As I noted earlier, while I deplore the hardship that has been inflicted on the travelling public as a result of the dispute, I recognise that legitimate issues are involved.  It is not for me to call an industrial dispute.  This particular dispute has existed for many months and has nothing to do with any topical issue that has arisen in the past few weeks.  It has been at conciliation at the Labour Relations Commission for many months.  It went through that process and was subsequently the subject of a full Labour Court recommendation, which sided with the company and its management.  Thereafter, there were ongoing discussions.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">However, stating what the Labour Court does will not resolve any dispute.  As I noted earlier, its recommendations are not binding.  The Deputy was correct in one respect, namely, this constitutes the substitution of old-fashioned conflict for what should be sensible negotiations and agreement.  The company does not benefit from this and I believe that creative solutions should be found as in any other dispute.  I urge the parties to use the highly effective industrial relations machinery available to resolve this issue.  Many people working within this machinery are familiar with Dublin Bus and have the capacity to deal with this issue, which has persisted for some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">In fairness to the company in this case, it went through the process.  I am usually critical of those who do not go through the machinery of the State, which we support through social partnership.  With the exception of the Labour Relations Commission, this machinery preceded social partnership.  The Labour Court existed before social partnership and people should abide by it.  However, the dispute is now under way and people have ignored both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  At least they should try to find creative solutions and to stop the hardship inflicted on the travelling public.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">In respect of Aer Lingus, all Members are aware that many difficult change issues arise because of the nature of change within that sector.  I recognise that discussion on this particular issue has been ongoing without resolution for the better part of six months.  It is clear the threatened action will have an impact on customer behaviour.  Bookings will be lost and confidence in the airline might well be affected, which is in the interests of neither the company nor its employees.  The national implementation body, which acts under the remit of social partnership and Towards 2016, has met the company and the trade unions recently.  It is considering whether it can make a useful recommendation to the parties regarding the difficult issues that have arisen.  It is best to deal with and resolve them by agreement, rather than by risking lasting damage in an industrial dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_63">I do not accept Deputy Gilmore's suggestion that these difficulties reflect a wider problem in industrial relations.  More than 2 million people work every day and nowadays there are only a handful of disputes.  On the contrary, the very salience of the issues at Dublin Bus and Aer Lingus reflects instead the extent to which industrial peace and harmony, as well as the smooth management of change, has been the norm in the partnership process and there is no reason this pattern should not continue into the future.  I do not believe there is any connection between any of these issues and what David Begg said.  In fact, I was at the meeting and I read the speeches of both David Begg and Jack O'Connor.  What both of them said, as I understand it, is that they accepted that the increases recommended by the review body were the result of an independent assessment based on the principles of comparability which are an established feature of public sector pay determination.  The pay increases reflect trends in the private sector at senior levels.  These private sector trends were the primary focus of the comments made by David Begg and Jack O'Connor.  They made comments about the private sector right across the board.  They were commenting not on the increases that were paid under the review body but on the increases across the private sector, and they clearly have a point.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_19">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_64">The Taoiseach has referred a couple of times to comparisons with the private sector to justify the pay increase which he has given himself.  These private sector comparisons are understandable when one is considering, for example, the salaries of chief executives of State companies, which may be comparable to private sector wages.  Similarly, salaries among the Judiciary may be compared with earnings in the legal profession.  Can the Taoiseach tell the House what private sector comparison he is relying on to justify his own pay increase?  I am not aware that there are comparisons that can be made with the private sector in respect of political offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_65">Since I asked specifically about the Dublin Bus dispute, can the Taoiseach tell us whether there are plans to ask the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission or any of the industrial relations bodies established under the social partnership arrangement to intervene in that dispute and bring about a settlement?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_20">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_66">I do not think there are currently any plans to ask for intervention.  However, I take the opportunity to say that I understand both the position of the company and of the union.  The company put its case through the conciliation process and the Labour Court and received an adjudication.  That said, I have listened to some senior bus workers who said they had particular understandings of how these routes would work and that the arrangements are not in line with these understandings.  It is true that the Labour Court considered these understandings and rejected them, but that does not solve the dispute or improve the situation for the travelling public.  While these matters are not binding, and the company can argue its position, both sides should look for creative solutions, as in any dispute.  I urge both parties to use the highly effective industrial relations machinery that exists to try to find the basis of an agreement.  I am not saying this will be easy, because the dispute has been going on for quite a long time, but I ask them to consider this.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">On the matter of pay increases, I am not looking for any comparators as that is not the Government's job.  It is seven years since a report such as this was issued by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  Of the 2,000 people covered in this report, politicians and office holders account for 20 or 30.  In money terms, it is a very small percentage of the total.  The review body has conducted a pay review after a seven-year gap — the previous review was in the summer of 2000 — and I note the report states that we should return to a four-year period between reviews.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">The Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector was established way back in 1969, a year when there was much industrial unrest in one form or another.  It is an independent entity.  It has the primary function of advising the Government on these matters.  The body's most recent report covered the Civil Service, local authorities, health boards, non-commercial State bodies, An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, hospital consultants, the Judiciary and the political officeholders.  As the Deputy will be aware, the group did not base politicians on anyone — either those in the commercial semi-State bodies or, for that matter, industry.  If one looks across private sector industry, people who would be considered to be in high management jobs, most of those at the top end — this is the point of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions — earn in excess of €1 million.  Thankfully, the group members did not recommend such increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_69">They looked at what they believed was a comparator, taking into account the 15% for pension provision.  They looked at those rates, which are far less than what would be occurring in the private sector.  If one looks at the range in the 30 or so companies in the private sector that are normally listed, there is no comparison between the review body's recommendations and those areas.  I am not arguing for a second that there should be.  The review covers a seven year period, five years extended by two.  Some people said that this should cover the four year period until the next review.  That would not have made much difference, one way or the other.  It came to under 3% a year across the system.  While the total amount is high, and my own increase of €38,000 is considered high, it was done on a basis that was independent and has been followed for 38 years.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_21">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_70">Does the Taoiseach recall that two of the key issues addressed at the ICTU conference in July were the vital concerns of all Irish workers of trade union recognition and the ongoing disgraceful abuse of agency workers by employers?</p>
            <p eId="para_71">When will the Government bring in legislation to make it mandatory on employers to recognise trade union activities within their respective work places?  How does the Taoiseach respond to the situation whereby workers who are seeking to organise trade union activity in their respective work places face dismissal?  How does he respond to the situation that employers in this State are making it a condition of employment that employees, or prospective employees, do not involve themselves in trade union activity?  How can we square those situations with the fact that Government recognises the trade union sector as a critical and important part of the social partnership process?  What does the Taoiseach intend to do about this?  When does he intend to bring in legislation to ensure that all employers properly recognise and accord due recognition to trade unions and their respective representatives within all areas of employment?</p>
            <p eId="para_72">On the second issue, the issue of agency workers, is the Taoiseach aware that this State, Britain and Hungary are the only three states within the European Union that have not legislated to ensure that agency workers are treated in exactly the same way as directly employed labour?  Is he aware that we have a situation here where directly employed workers and agency engaged employees are working side by side doing exactly the same work but receiving two very different levels of pay for their work and, indeed, in regard to the latter category, those employed through the agencies are actually in poorer working conditions in real terms?  What does the Taoiseach propose to do about this inequality that is perpetuated, sadly, by Irish employers and others who have established here over the years?  Does the Taoiseach agree that it is patently in the interest of all workers, those who are directly employed and those who are agency engaged, that all workers are treated equally in terms of pay for work done and conditions of employment, and that the latter category applies to both Irish workers and non-national workers within the agency sector?  Does he agree that it is hugely important in the interest of all and a fair return for labour that each are treated exactly the same?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_22">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_73">Time will not allow me answer all of those questions.  Generally, I support implementation of the employment rights and compliance agenda agreed under Towards 2016.  The Deputy is aware that several issues arise in that regard.  There was a Supreme Court decision earlier in the year which created difficulties for the trade unions.  That matter is under discussion by trade unions, employers and us.  Agency workers have become a big issue because of the way so many of the immigrants and those who are coming in under the European regulations are being employed.  Detailed discussions are ongoing in regard to those issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">Deputy Ó Caoláin asked for an update regarding employment rights and the compliance agenda.  We spent a long time working on Towards 2016.  We spent five or six months working on a comprehensive package of measures dealing with employment rights and compliance.  The Deputy touched on several of the points.  They included the establishment of a new statutory body for employment rights compliance, a trebling of the number of labour inspectors, significant increases in penalties for non-compliance with employment law — that is for Irish workers or immigrant workers — measures to further protect agency workers, which is part of that package, and new legislation in regard to exceptional collective redundancy and dismissals in the context of industrial disputes.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">That agreement also provided for the establishment of more user-friendly adjudication and redress mechanisms in the employment rights area.  All of those are covered in the agreement.  If I were to go through each of them, it would take a considerable amount of time.  The Employment Law Compliance Bill will be published before the end of this year.  It will provide among other things for the establishment on a statutory basis of the new employment rights authority, NERA.  A director has been appointed and the management team is in place.  More than 20 labour inspectors have been appointed.  Ten inspectors with specific language skills are being recruited.  The number of inspectors will be increased from the current level of 37 to 90 by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has also announced proposals in regard to the regionalisation of the labour inspectorate.  We also enacted the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 which covers a number of these points.  Regarding the Revenue Commissioners, we have updated the powers of investigation of self-employment issues which is a large part of what the Deputy inquired about.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">On the welfare side, we introduced very strict regulations and obligations in regard to PRSI.  The sixth part was the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act which was signed in the summer of 2007.  Progress on all these issues is ongoing.  The agency issue is still under discussion as the union side feels significant abuses still operate in this area.  I have discussed this with individual unions and with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We are committed to trying to make further progress in that area.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_79">The emphasis placed by Government on tackling educational disadvantage in recent years is unprecedented.  Since 2003, we have increased investment in educational inclusion measures at all levels by no less than 60%, spending €730 million in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">We are determined to ensure that young people from disadvantaged areas get the support they need to encourage them to finish school.  To this end, we have provided additional investment in a wide range of areas, including extra teachers, grants for books, homework clubs, school meals and summer camps.  We have also expanded access to important services such as the home school community liaison scheme and the school completion programme, which work with students at risk of early school leaving and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">There are now approximately 620 staff working in services such as these, including more than 130 extra posts allocated under the DEIS action plan over the past two years.  In addition, the National Educational Welfare Board now has more than 100 staff and is specifically tasked with tackling attendance problems that if left unchecked can culminate in young people dropping out of school.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">There is an emphasis under DEIS on helping children to make a smooth transition to second level.  Initiatives such as familiarisation days and week-long transfer programmes have been shown to have been very successful in that regard.  Schools participating in the school support programme under DEIS are being encouraged to prioritise the development of effective transfer programmes for pupils making the transition to post-primary education.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">In terms of achievement at post-primary level, it is important to examine the issue in terms of attainment of second level education or equivalent rather than just school completion.  Focusing just on school devalues the hard work of students who continued their education in Youthreach centres, went on to train for apprenticeships through FÁS or acquired qualifications through other equally valuable routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">The Government is encouraged by data that shows that the attainment levels of our young people have improved significantly in recent years.  By 2006, 85.4% of Irish people aged 20 to 24 years old had obtained upper second level education or equivalent — up from 82.6% in 2000 and significantly ahead of the EU average of 77.8%.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">The improvement in the proportion aged 20 to 24 years old with at least second level education or equivalent in recent years is testament to the success of the dual strategy of both improving school completion levels and increasing access to second chance and further education.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">Further improvements in the availability of second chance education are a priority for us.  As the Deputy may be aware, funding has been provided for 400 extra Youthreach places this year.  Six hundred more places are due to be provided by 2009 under the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">We are also conscious that the content and perceived relevance of the school curricula have an important effect on students' motivation and desire to finish school.  Under the DEIS plan, more students in disadvantaged areas will have access to the junior certificate schools programme and the leaving certificate applied programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">There is evidence that the Government's focus on improving school completion rates and attainment levels in recent years is making a difference.  I assure the Deputy that further improvements in this area will continue to be a priority for us in the years ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">Social inclusion measures across other Departments have also been prioritised under the Towards 2016 agreement, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and the national development plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">The Minister did not answer the question.  My question related to the school drop-out rate.  Is she aware that in the census report of 1996, approximately 3% of students had dropped out of post-primary education by the age of 15 years?  The latest data from the 2006 census shows that the figure is 6.6%.  Last year, 3,700 students had left post-primary education by the age of 15 years.  That is a doubling of the school drop-out rate over the past ten years.  Will the Minister accept that her Government and her administration over the past ten years have failed miserably to tackle this problem?</p>

            <p eId="para_94">It is widely accepted that the participation rate of 15 year old students is within 0.5% of the total numbers.  Clarification on this question was sought from the Central Statistics Office and the Taoiseach answered a question on it last week when he stated: "It should be borne in mind that the figures for persons aged 15 years may be affected by the fact that this age was used in a filter question on the census questionnaire, resulting in a possible over-statement of the number of 15 year olds who have ceased education".  The CSO provided this information to the Taoiseach stating it was not a straightforward question to 15 year old people about their standard of education and whether they were still in school.  The question was to the effect that if they were under age 15 they should skip to number 34 on the next page, and the CSO has said that a higher number than expected skipped the entire question on education.  It is widely accepted that we could not depend on that figure because of the nature of the way in which that question was put.  It was a filtering question rather than a direct question put to 15 year old people.  All of the evidence the Department has, and on international surveys, shows that our participation rates and school completion rates for 15 year old students are much higher than most of the European average, as I have already identified.</p>

            <p eId="para_95">We are now in the unusual situation where the Minister is attempting to rubbish the independent impartial figures that have been produced by the CSO.  That is astonishing because her Department has used the CSO figures for the past ten years to back up its case.  Will the Minister respond to the recent comments by the chief executive officer of the National Education Welfare Board?  He stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_96">We are available in the most disadvantaged areas but outside that we are just working with crisis cases.  We would prefer to be doing a lot more preventative work and early intervention work.</p>
            <p eId="para_97">My understanding is that the National Educational Welfare Board has sought 50 additional officers to help children falling through the education system and that the Department is prepared to give 15 of the 50 requirements.  Is this not a case where the Minister sets up a body, refuses to fund the body and then blames the body and everyone else for her own failures in this area?</p>

        <b>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science,</b>
         further to her reply to Parliamentary Question No. 158 of 1 November 2007, the reason her Department has sanctioned money to primary schools to rent prefabs as temporary accommodation for a period of three years or less but has no details of the terms of the contract and the rental cost between the school authority and the rental company as she has already indicated the sum involved is €24.5 million; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [28490/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_41" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_111">Increased enrolments and the appointment of nearly 5,000 extra primary teachers since 2002 alone have created a considerable demand for extra school accommodation in recent years.  This is being met by unprecedented investment in the school building programme, with more than €540 million being spent this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">My Department has sought to provide schools with permanent solutions to their accommodation needs where possible.  Construction in 2007 alone will deliver more than 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for more than 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">One of the methods that has helped us to keep expenditure on prefabs at a minimum has been the introduction of the permanent accommodation scheme.  Since 2003, schools have been offered capital funding to build extra classrooms rather than taking prefabs.  Between 2003 and 2006, 200 schools were approved under this scheme, at a total cost of €54.1 million, but last year, €27.5 million was provided for this scheme.  We have dramatically increased the allocation in 2007 to €47.4 million to allow more than 305 classrooms and 182 resource rooms to be sanctioned this year alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">This and other initiatives have enabled us to keep expenditure on the rental of temporary accommodation low.  The Deputy's question refers to the fact that €24.5 million was spent on rental last year.  I should also point out that while much of this rented accommodation is in prefabricated units it can also include the rental of buildings.  It is important to put this figure in context.  In fact, it amounts to less than 5% of the almost €525 million invested in school buildings last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">Where accommodation is needed at very short notice, however, temporary accommodation can be the only option.  Such accommodation may also be used where the need is short-term, such as when a school requires a temporary building or is awaiting the completion of construction of permanent facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">With a view to shortening construction times and achieving better value for money, my Department has developed standard designs for primary schools, known as generic repeat designs.  Using such a design, the construction of Griffeen Valley Educate Together school took only five months.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">We are also moving towards greater use of system build accommodation, whereby a significant amount of the construction work for school buildings can be completed off-site while planning permission is awaited.  Using this type of approach, my Department was able to provide a new 16 classroom school in Laytown this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">As part of the strategy for the provision of school places for 2008 and onwards, my Department has initiated a tender process for a drawdown contract facility that will be used to provide additional school places in the rapidly developing areas.  This is aimed at providing school accommodation in very short timescales using modern methodologies such as off-site construction.  We are using a range of methods, therefore, to limit the need for temporary accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">Regarding the information on individual rental agreements sought by the Deputy, the situation is that in general, the board of management of a school is responsible for acquiring temporary accommodation, including the procurement of prefabs.  In practice, a rental contract is between a school's board of management and a supplying contractor.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">It is important to emphasise that the Department examines all applications for additional accommodation on an individual basis to determine if the need exists in the first instance.  My officials also decide if the level of funding being sought by a school for prefab rental is acceptable.  My Department is satisfied that adequate financial management measures are in place and that comprehensive information is available on individual records held on individual school files.  However, my Department does not have details of all of these contractual arrangements entered into by schools available in a format that provides readily accessible cumulative information on the overall position.  It is intended to address this issue as part of a general review of rental policy currently being undertaken by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_122">I thank the Minister for her reply, but had I replied similarly to a question she set for me in one of the classes she occupied expertly in Sion Hill, I would have failed.  She did not answer a question I asked clearly.  She gave the House a wonderful story about construction and all sorts of other things, but it did not address the question.  Nor did she answer Deputy Brian Hayes's question.  My question related to the Minister's previous misleading reply which read:</p>

            <p eId="para_124">That is what I wanted to find out.  The rest of the information, for which I thank the Minister, was wonderful but irrelevant to my question.  She is deliberately evading parliamentary questions a second time by answering every question that was not asked and refusing to answer the questions asked.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">We are discussing Allspace Limited prefabs, which have a guaranteed life expectancy of 30 years and a possible expectancy of up to 50 years.  My question asked whether the Minister examines the terms of the contracts, it did not relate to the other wonderful, irrelevant information.  I was happy to receive them, but they were not the answer.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">The innovations in the design and delivery of school buildings put in place in recent years mean that once the land has been acquired, we can provide school accommodation quickly.  While Fingal County Council is working on the acquisition of sites, my Department has tendered for a contractor capable of delivering new schools within an on-site construction time of four months.  My Department has been in regular contact with local authority staff regarding the status of the sites we have asked them to acquire.</p>
            <p eId="para_147">Last September, I met the council manager and others to discuss progress.  While the meeting gave rise to considerable media attention, it was not the start of the co-operation between the Department and the council, which has been ongoing for some time.  Two years ago, the Department and the council agreed to develop a new model of partnership for providing school and community facilities.  Under the terms of the Fingal school agreement, the local authority has undertaken to identify and acquire appropriate sites for schools as recommended by the Department.  The design of the schools will be varied to meet community needs, including enhanced facilities, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">As site acquisitions can be commercially sensitive, my Department does not generally provide specific details in advance of contracts being signed.  Once the contracts have been signed, the information can be released in the normal way.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">While the scale of the work under way in Fingal is extensive because of rapid population growth in that area, my Department has developed much closer working relations generally with local authorities in recent years, particularly in rapidly developing areas.  In addition to meeting the Fingal County Council manager, I met the county managers of Meath and Kildare and am arranging to meet the managers of South Dublin County Council and Westmeath County Council to follow up on what is required in terms of planning.  I met the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss how the programme for Government commitments in respect of school planning and land acquisition can be progressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_150">This is curious.  I asked the Minister to tell the House which 13 sites the Department or the council has acquired for the purpose of the Fingal agreement.  Splashed all over the national media in September was a firm commitment that 13 schools would be built and up and running by 1 September 2008.  Does the Minister stand by this commitment?  If so, why can she not inform Dáil Éireann of the specific sites or their general locations?</p>
            <p eId="para_151">The timeframe is ambitious.  If the Minister was serious when she told the House that individual planning applications in respect of the 13 schools, which will be built off-site, would take at least three months, will the sites be ready for Fingal's children by 1 September 2008?</p>

         if there is an ongoing review and analysis being carried out in the Kinvara catchment area, County Galway on the provision of a second level co-education school in Kinvara as a replacement for a school (details supplied); if a similar review was completed by the planning unit of her Department before the announcement of 16 May 2007 in which she stated that a new second level school would be provided in Kinvara; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_163">In light of increases in population in the south Galway area and the decision of the Sisters of Mercy to close Seamount college, Kinvara, on a phased basis, I determined that a new post-primary school would be required in the south Galway area.  I asked the commission on school accommodation to conduct a survey of school accommodation in the area to determine the location of the proposed post-primary school and to identify other locations where additional school places may be required over the next five to ten years.  Areas included in the survey are Oranmore-Clarinbridge, Claregalway, Athenry, Gort-Ardrahan and Kinvara.  The commission placed an advertisement in the local and national media on 23 April inviting interested parties to submit their views in writing to the commission by 15 May.  Some 25 written submissions were received from a range of individuals and organisations such as patrons, boards of management, teachers, parent groups, local communities and the Association of Secondary Teachers, ASTI.  The commission noted that such a broad response was indicative of the strong support by the community for educational provision in the area and showed that solid links have been formed between the schools and their respective local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">The commission, consisting of a dedicated technical group and the secretariat, undertook a public consultation process.  It met representatives of the ASTI staff from Seamount college in June 2007.  On 16, 17 and 18 October it met all the patrons involved, representatives of boards of management, principal teachers, staff members and representatives of the Rescue Seamount Committee and paid visits to each of the post-primary schools in the area.  The commission is currently engaged in an analysis of all key issues such as baptisms, demography and population, migration, diversity, primary and post-primary enrolment trends, regional and local authority plans for industry and housing, and house building.  This analysis, in conjunction with information from those consulted, will facilitate the commission in reaching its conclusions and recommendations.  I expect the commission's report will be submitted to me by the end of November.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">When a new school has been approved a number of procedures and processes must be undertaken and these can take some time to complete.  The main stages are identification and acquisition of a suitable site, the design of the building, the application for and granting of planning permission, invitation to seek tenders and construction.</p>

            <p eId="para_166">I thank the Minister for her answer.  Before 16 May a full analysis of the population trends in the Kinvara catchment area and south Galway in general was completed.  Based on this analysis the Minister decided to provide for, and announced, the continuation of second-level education in Kinvara.  Based on what the Minister has stated we are indulging in a further examination of south Galway from Gort to Athenry, Oranmore and Kinvara.</p>

            <p eId="para_168">The trustees of Seamount college gave ground by allowing for an intake last September.  That was not part of the agenda when they made their announcement nearly a year ago.  They have shown they are committed to allowing for the replacement of Seamount college.  The Minister has made her commitment subject to the intake for five years.  Why cannot the Minister give a commitment and show a positive response to their commitment, which was not available 12 months ago?  Although three sites have been identified, the Department of Education and Science's planning section has made no response to examine them as an initial step.  Why cannot the Minister indicate, through her actions, to the trustees and management board of Seamount college that she is prepared to provide second level education in Kinvara and cut out the delay tactics?  If we can build hospitals in three years, why cannot we build a second level school for 600 pupils in Kinvara in three years?</p>

            <p eId="para_172">However there has been no agreement on the other years.  The original intention on 16 May was that it would be for the next five years and this would allow for a continuity of provision.  Any work before the summer related only to Kinvara, although we are aware of the population increases in other areas of south Galway, particularly around areas such as Ardrahan and Athenry.  That is why those areas were also examined.  It was an important opportunity for the commission to examine the population and meet all the relevant bodies because any decision on a school in south Galway will impact on the existing schools, for example Oranmore and Gort.  The process undertaken is extensive.  I expect to have the report at the end of November and look forward to making a decision on it.  The Deputy mentioned a school of 500 or 600 pupils, but I expect that any school would be at least 700 or 800.  We would seek a site appropriate for that number of students and that would ensure it was the proper catchment for where the greatest population is.  All these issues must be taken into account.  It is not an immediate priority that must be done today or tomorrow because there is a school there, whereas some areas have no school——</p>

It is important that she clarify this.  The Minister knows that Gort community school is severely overcrowded.  Schools in Oranmore and Athenry are also overcrowded.  The population in this area is, uniquely, increasing by 8% per annum.  All the numbers in the schools have already been identified and the Minister has them.</p>

            <p eId="para_181">The safety of children travelling on the school transport service is of paramount importance to my Department and to Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport scheme.  To this end, Bus Éireann has a wide range of checking procedures in place, in addition to statutory vehicle examinations, to ensure, as far as reasonably possible, that a safe and reliable service is delivered.  These procedures are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure that appropriate standards are maintained and improved upon, where possible.  In recent years, a range of measures to enhance safety and to improve the quality of the school transport service has been put in place, both in the vicinity of and on board school buses.  These measures include the phasing out of the three-for-two seating arrangement on primary and post-primary services and providing all children with an individual seat equipped with a seat belt.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">The planning of school bus routes, which includes designating pick-up and set-down points, is an operational matter for Bus Éireann.  However, my Department and Bus Éireann are conscious of the fact that, in spite of the highest safety standards being applied, children are more at risk of being injured in the vicinity of a bus than travelling on the bus itself.  A warning flashing light pilot scheme on school buses was launched in Ennis, County Clare in 2005 and a further phase of the pilot scheme will commence in the coming weeks in a number of other designated areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">All vehicles operating under the school transport scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of Transport.  Vehicles with more than eight adult seats and which are more than one year old, are required to pass the Department of Transport's annual roadworthiness test.  Private operators employed by Bus Éireann under the school transport scheme are contractually obliged to keep their nominated vehicles in a safe and roadworthy condition at all times.  These contractors are required to meet an extensive range of regulations and standards as set out by the Department of Transport for use of buses in a public place.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">Bus Éireann conducts on-the-road service checks using 40 mobile school bus inspectors, who board the buses in the course of their checks to ensure the vehicle and driver are as nominated, and to check that other safety requirements are being observed.  Follow-up action is taken by the local Bus Éireann office, which can include termination of contract if deficiencies are detected.  A leading international independent agency has been engaged by Bus Éireann to carry out mechanically-based checks on a random basis on both Bus Éireann and privately-owned contractors' vehicles operating under the scheme throughout the country.  In conjunction with this exercise, the same agency is carrying out audits of maintenance procedures in use by school bus contractors to make sure they meet best industry standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  We were very concerned that the importance of safety on school buses might not be paramount in the Department so I appreciate that.  The Minister of State highlighted that he is phasing out three for two seat belts, but he has been phasing it out for a long time.  Is it in the process of being phased out or has the process been completed?  Has every student got an individual seat belt and is the rule being enforced?</p>

            <p eId="para_186">The phasing out process was completed in December 2006.  As part of the school bus transport scheme, every student now has a seat belt and retrospective fitting of seat belts occurred in many cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_187">The Minister also rightly highlighted the fact that many accidents occur at school bus stops.  If the pilot scheme introduced in County Clare was successful, more should be done to introduce more schemes.  This happened in early 2005, yet nearly three years later no other scheme has been introduced.  We want to see results and safety for every bus stop in the country, especially when we are talking about school transport.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_190">Relationships and sexuality education, RSE, is embedded in the social, personal and health education curriculum in primary schools and in the junior cycle.  In the senior cycle, schools are also  required to deliver an RSE programme.  Sexual orientation and safe sex are not featured as part of the curriculum in primary schools, but the generic skills and values for respecting difference and relating to others are fostered.  The SPHE programme is designed to promote the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help the child to create and maintain supportive relationships and to become an active responsible citizen in society.  The curriculum is built around three strands — Myself, Myself and Others and Myself and the Wider World, and it deals with issues such as making decisions, developing self-confidence, growing and changing, personal safety, relating to friends, family and others, handling conflict, respecting difference and developing awareness of bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">At junior cycle, these themes are continued.  The relationships and sexuality education component of the programme focuses on issues such as hygiene, puberty, reproduction, pregnancy, resisting peer pressure, relationships, and accepting difference.  The programme is supported by a comprehensive resource pack which includes lesson plans, case studies and activities.  The topics include areas such as teenage pregnancy, understanding how certain behaviour can put students at risk, discussion on the implications of sexual activity, gender stereotyping, misconceptions about homosexuals and the importance of respect and tolerance when relating to others.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">At senior cycle, the RSE programme includes in-depth coverage relating to reproduction, puberty, sexuality, family planning, contraception, responsible parenthood, implications of sexual activity, sexually transmitted infections, accepting sexual orientation, as well as relationships issues.  Sexual harassment, sexual assault and sexual abuse are also covered, with where to seek help.  The materials include case studies and quizzes designed to promote discussion and to dispel common myths about sex, pregnancy and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">Regarding sexual orientation, the emphasis is on recognising the ways different sexual orientations can be discriminated against, discussion of attitudes to sexual orientation, and understanding the need to value and respect difference.  A recent evaluation of the implementation of RSE in second level schools, while highlighting many positive developments, has indicated that the content of the programme is being implemented selectively.  Students reported that they consider that the topics of contraception, safe sex, condom use and sexual orientation are not adequately dealt with.  In response, work is under way on the development of lesson plans linked to a DVD resource for teachers on contraception, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation, in collaboration with the Health Services Executive and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.

            <p eId="para_200">Entry fees for the 2008 leaving certificate examination have not yet been determined.  I expect that a decision will be taken very shortly with a view to announcing the new fee levels before the end of the current school term.  The standard leaving certificate examination fee that applied for the years 2002-07 are as follows: 2002, €73; 2003, €76; 2004, €86; 2005, €90; 2006, €92; and 2007, €96.  Examination fees are generally increased each year in line with increases in the consumer price index.  It has not been the practice to hold discussions with the Department of Social and Family Affairs or any other Government agency before setting examination fee levels.  There is an alleviation scheme in place whereby current medical card holders and their dependents are exempt from the payment of examination fees.  This exemption applies to approximately 30% of all examination candidates each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">The income received from examination fees generally covers only a fraction of the cost of running the examinations.  The costs associated with examinations have been increasing significantly in recent years due to the introduction of new methods of assessment in various subjects and continuing increases in special arrangements for students with special needs.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_96" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_203">The revised primary curriculum was developed in partnership with key education interests by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and published and launched by my Department in 1999.  A copy of the curriculum, in the form of 23 books, was issued to every teacher.  Implementation has been effected on a phased basis, supported by national programmes of professional development for teachers, full details of which have also been communicated to schools at each stage of theprocess.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">The curriculum provides an integrated programme of learning in the spheres of languages, mathematics, social, environmental and scientific education and so on.  The curriculum in religion is developed by the various church authorities and not by the NCCA.  All schools are required to teach all aspects of the curriculum in all grades from junior infants through to sixth class, inclusive.  While flexibility is in-built to facilitate local choice of discretionary curriculum time, the curriculum sets out a suggested minimum weekly timeframe for each subject area.  In the curriculum for each subject area, a set of learning objectives is set out for four groupings, namely, infant classes, first and second class, third and fourth class, and fifth and sixth class.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">Regulations in the form of a statutory instrument to prescribe the revised primary school curriculum have not been put in place. The rules for national schools, together with Department circulars and documents issued to schools, constitute administrative measures governing the recognition, operation, management and conduct of national schools.  While these rules, circulars and documents are non-statutory, they are lawful measures which have been judicially considered and accorded the imprimatur of the Irish courts on a number of occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">The Education Act 1998 provides the Minister with the power to make regulations relating to a range of issues concerning the provision of education by schools.  I favour the incremental use of those regulatory powers where appropriate to replace existing rules, circulars and communications with schools.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_207">The Minister will be aware of a recent case initiated in the High Court concerning Irish language immersion at a young age.  While I do not wish to comment on the particulars of this ongoing case, the persons who brought the case have been allowed to have the matter dealt with further in the High Court.  It came to attention early in the court case that at no stage since the revised curriculum was adopted by the Department and the Minister has it been given statutory effect by way of regulations.  Is the Minister aware of any advice from the Department to effectively put the revised curriculum on a statutory footing?</p>
            <p eId="para_208">I understand that on several occasions, officials in the Department have advised her to this effect, as highlighted by an investigative journalism report by TG4.  Given the import of the curriculum and circulars that followed it since 1999, it would make more sense to put it in a statutory form to ensure its legal certainty.</p>

            <p eId="para_209">There is a value to putting circulars on a regulatory basis.  As I stated, the curriculum is not currently on a basis of regulation.  That does not mean it cannot be implemented, as can any of the other instructions given to schools.  The High Court has found in the past that items such as circulars have legal effect.  It would be valuable to put the circulars on a statutory footing, removing any legal uncertainty.  At the same time, it does not take from the right of any Minister to issue circulars or instructions.  We will be doing that.</p>

            <p eId="para_212">It certainly looks like it.  This story was broken by TG4 three weeks ago.  Since then there has been much toing and froing and a court case has started.  The Minister is now telling the Dáil she will put this on a legal basis.  When will she do that?</p>
            <p eId="para_213">Is the Minister concerned that some of the circulars following the revised curriculum in place since 1999 could now be legally defective?  If this issue is applicable to Irish language immersion in gaelscoileanna, it must be applicable to other circulars which the Minister has failed to sign into law during her tenure.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_102" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_214">There is absolutely no need to sign circulars into law.  Over the years, the courts have clearly determined that rules, regulations and circulars have been given a legal basis and have the same understanding as if laid down in law.  Where circulars have been issued, they do have a standing and status and must be implemented.  The only development in the referred court case was that the court determined that there shall be a judicial review.  No determination has been made on the merits or the value of the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_215">The Minister of the day has the right to make rules.  This goes back to the mid-19th century when rules for national schools were introduced.  This was replaced with rules for national schools in 1922.  In 1935 the Ministers and Secretaries Act put the drawing up of rules under the remit of the Minister for Education.  The rules for establishing new schools make it clear that a school can only be recognised if it implements the curriculum.  I have no concerns, therefore, with issued circulars and the legal basis which they hold.</p>

         further to her reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 125, 150 and 158 of 2 October 2007 the reason for the discrepancy in the promise in the programme for Government to reduce the primary pupil-teacher ratio to one primary teacher for every 24 primary pupils by 2010 when she herself asserts that the primary pupil teacher ratio already stands at 16:1 as stated in her reply to the parliamentary questions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_107" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_221">The referred commitment in the programme for Government relates to a reduction in class sizes, through improvements in the staffing schedule by which classroom teachers are assigned to schools.  The pupil-teacher ratio on the other hand, counts all the teachers in schools, not only those employed as mainstream classroom teachers, but also those working in areas such as resource teaching and language support.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than in 2002.  The estimated annual value of additional expenditure on these posts is approximately €300 million.  As a result of the appointment of extra teachers, the pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced to 16.4:1.  In addition to mainstream class teaching duties, additional posts have been used for other improvements.  These include the introduction of the general allocation model for deploying learning support-resource teachers in September 2005 and the allocation of additional learning support-resource teachers.  There has been a major expansion in the number of language support teachers meaning some schools have six language support teachers each; the appointment of administrative principals for schools with principal and four or five mainstream teachers which also has a specialist autism unit; and the appointment of administrative deputy principals for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_223">The staffing schedule for the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to schools has also been improved.  In the 2005-06 school year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children.  This year it was reduced to one for 27.</p>
            <p eId="para_224">The threshold for getting a developing school post has also been reduced in recent years specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  More than 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007-08 school year compared to 117 in 2003-04.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">The programme for Government commitment involves further improvements in the staffing schedule for primary schools so that subject to financial consideration schools would be staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 24 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_226">The improvements made in primary school staffing in recent years are unparalleled.  The Government is committed to providing more primary teachers over the next five years. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure increased resources lead to better outcomes.</p>

            <p eId="para_227">The Minister's reply clarifies what many ordinary people, particularly parents, find confusing at times.  There is the ratio of teachers to pupils, which includes staff pupils may never see, and the pupil-teacher ratio in the classroom.  Will the Minister confirm that the pupil-teacher ratio in the classroom is 1:27?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_109" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_228">No, it is unfair to say there are teachers in schools whom pupils may never see.  The people who are not counted in class-size number are the principal, deputy principal, home-school liaison officers, resource, learning support and special needs teachers.  These are staff the pupils will see every day but they are not teaching, say, Irish, English, maths, history, geography in the classroom.</p>
            <p eId="para_229">The Deputy is wrong in how he put his question.  The average class-size is determined by the number of mainstream classroom teachers divided by the number of children.  Schools are allocated a teacher for every 27 children.  Smaller schools are much more generous; for example, one can get schools consisting of 12 children that can have two teachers.  The pupil-teacher ratio is calculated by every teacher in a school, whether it is a classroom or learning support teacher, divided by the number of students.  That is why it is as low as 1:16 in some schools.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_230">Parents with little or no experience of the bureaucracy of the Department of Education and Science or the science associated with teaching will be concerned as to how many other children will be in first, second or third class along with their Máire or Johnny.  All other non-classroom teachers are seen as backup and support.  Parents' main concern is the actual ratio of primary school teachers to the number of children in a classroom in those critical schoolgoing years.  Will the Minister agree on some clarity in conveying this information to the wider public and the House?  To judge by the answer I received on 2 October the Minister can manipulate the figures to produce different kinds of results.  While I am not accusing the Minister of doing that I seek clarity so that parents understand how many pupils there are in their children's classrooms.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_111" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_231">Class size may be an issue for the parent whose child does not need anything extra.  The special needs and resource teachers are necessary for the child who has a learning difficulty.  The 1,800 teachers who teach nothing but English to newcomers are important for the children who do not speak English.  The home-school community liaison teacher is important for the parent who needs support to link in.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">Class size is an issue for some people but schools are staffed for their mainstream classroom teacher in the ratio of 1:27.  There is no international evidence to show that class size makes a whit of difference to the outcomes except in the lowest classes.  Notwithstanding that it makes no difference up the line, we have made a commitment to ensure that we continue to reduce class size but it is equally important that the other supports are available too.  If in the past three years all the teachers who went into special needs and language teaching had been employed to reduce class sizes the ratio would be approximately 1:15 but we had to prioritise the most vulnerable people such as the disadvantaged who have small class sizes, those with special educational needs and newcomers who do not speak English.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_234">The Education Act 1998 requires all schools to have in place an admissions policy, detailing admission to and participation by students, including those with special needs, in the school.  An agreement was reached in 1993 between the Department and the national representatives of the managerial associations regarding selection of pupils on the basis of academic ability.  While school enrolment policy is a matter for the managerial authorities of each individual school, it was agreed that selection on the basis of academic ability was to be discontinued.  It was also agreed that each school should disclose its enrolment policy and the criteria used in selecting pupils for enrolment.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">It was accepted that where schools receive more enrolment applications than they can cater for, a selection procedure is necessary.  Schools adopt different selection procedures in such cases, for example, priority given to pupils from national schools in the area; enrolment on a first-come, first-served basis; random selection on the basis of age of applicants; priority given to brothers and sisters of pupils already enrolled in the school; and to pupils of a particular religious denomination.  While enrolment procedures such as those are broadly acceptable, all the parties to the agreement emphasised the importance which they attach to the principle of the school working in and for the community it serves.  On that basis, post-primary schools should emphasise catering, in the first instance, for children from their own communities and catchment areas.  In formulating its admissions policy a school must ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_236">My Department has issued an information booklet to schools entitled Schools and the Equal Status Acts.  The booklet identifies ways in which the rights conferred and the duties imposed by this legislation, together with the education legislation can be used as building blocks for the creation of an inclusive school.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 allows the parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department.  Where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.  When considering an appeal of a decision of refusal to enrol, the appeals committee may consider the admissions policy of the school and on occasion an appeals committee has advised a school in its determination to revisit its admissions policy.  The determination of an appeals committee is issued to all the parties to an appeal.</p>

            <p eId="para_238">Are not some schools very selective in the way they decide not to take in children with special needs?  I agree with what the Minister said on this subject last year but we need to do something about it and ensure there is a rigorous process making clear that this kind of activity is unacceptable.  Is the Minister aware that it is also the policy of some secondary schools to require children in an existing primary school to leave that school and go into a private primary school before admission to their school?  A range of these issues needs sorting out and we need clear answers from the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_239">An audit was conducted of approximately 50% of schools examining the treatment of those with special needs, Travellers, newcomers etc.  I am not inclined to publish it because that might give rise to league tables in certain areas which would pressurise the schools that take a significant number of children with special needs.  Publishing results for an area could give the impression that a particular school took only children with special needs which would be unfair to the school.  It does however provide me with valuable information for determining the future policy direction.  I do not have the final statistics but the preliminary results show that some schools are taking more than their share of children with special needs.  Giving resources to the schools helps to smooth that difference.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy James Bannon — to outline what, if any, plans are in place, for a cohesive policy to expedite the development of slurry generated electricity; (2) Deputy Ulick Burke — to indicate the reasons for the delay in publishing the conditions and guidelines for the implementation of the mid-Shannon tax incentive scheme which was announced in the budget of 2006; (3) Deputy Deirdre Clune — the need to ensure that the regeneration of the Cork docklands area is facilitated through tax incentives; (4) Deputy Rory O'Hanlon — to discuss further the reply to parliamentary Questions Nos. 523 and 524 of Tuesday, 6 November; (5) Deputy Denis Naughten — a staffing grant for a child care group in County Roscommon; (6) Deputy Leo Varadkar — noting that the local electoral boundaries have not been reviewed since 1998 and noting the massive development that has occurred in many suburban areas and county towns in the interregnum, Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to appoint a boundary commission to redraw the local electoral boundaries in advance of the 2009 local elections; (7) Deputy Michael Lowry — the need to encourage industrialists and investors to locate in north Tipperary; (8) Deputy Joe Costello — to enact the Judicial Council Bill without delay; (9) Deputy Mary O'Rourke — if the Minister for Health and Children will outline fully all the arrangements which are being put in place for women from Longford-Westmeath who previously had been treated in Mullingar and who are now being told to present themselves to the Mater Hospital in Dublin; (10) Deputy Tom Hayes — whether the tax rebate system for diesel costs for scheduled bus services will be revoked as per a planned EU directive; if so, when this will occur; if an alternative system of funding will be set in place as happened in England earlier this year; if so, what form this funding will take; if the Minister is aware that 82% of school transport is privately contracted, and that these contractors agreed their contacts with the Government before they knew about the removal of this rebate; how long the Government has known about this EU directive; how the bus tour and the private rural transport industries are to cope with this 32 cent increase per litre of diesel in addition to rising diesel prices; and if the Minister for Finance can make a statement on forthcoming plans for this situation, covering the economic impact as well as the impact on small and large companies, rural transport and on school transport, as many companies may not be able to honour their contracts, detailing precisely what support CIE will get from the Government; (11) Deputy Timmy Dooley — in light of the recent fire at a commercial premises in Ennis, County Clare, concern has been raised at the lack of water pressure to deal with this and other emergency situations.  I call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to investigate the matter, and request him to consider such remedial works as are necessary to ensure an adequate supply and pressure of water to assist the fire service in dealing with any further fires in Ennis; (12) Deputy Joan Burton — the proposed VEC primary school for Diswellstown, Castleknock, Dublin 15; and (13) Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin — to provide additional beds, isolation units and single rooms to combat the continuing spread of MRSA and other very serious and potentially fatal infections in our hospitals in light of the report from Beaumont Hospital in Dublin that it is unable to isolate one third of patients with MRSA due to insufficient bed capacity.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">The third national hygiene audit of hospitals was published today and does not make encouraging reading.  The results show that not one of our public hospitals has been found to have a "very good" standard of hygiene.  Seven were rated as "good", 35 were "fair" and nine were "very poor" or "poor".  The results show that the standard has deteriorated since the Health Service Executive published the second audit in June 2006.  That audit rated 32 hospitals as "good", 19 as "fair" and only two as "poor" compared with nine today.  This confirms what most people believe, that the standards of hygiene and hygiene management programmes in our public hospitals are not what they should be.  People are scared that hospital acquired infections such as MRSA and those derived from other superbugs are a real threat to patient safety in hospitals and other health care settings.  We are spending €15 billion on the health care system and every member of the public understands that it is a fundamental requirement that hospitals be clean.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I accept the inspections were unannounced and that in many cases hospitals might be clean on the day of the inspection.  However, the issue is that many hospitals do not have a sufficiently robust hospital management hygiene programme.  That is resource and skills related.  In many cases, with respect, contract cleaners, who do their best, may not have the specialist training and skill to deal with hospitals where there is a risk of spreading MRSA and other superbugs.  The difference between the days of matrons running hospitals and the hospital management system that exists now is that standards of hygiene in many hospitals now are lower and this is reflected in the findings of the third report today.  Can the Taoiseach honestly say that the management system in our public hospitals is ready to put forward its public hospital hygiene management programme?  Can we as citizens and politicians say the programme is ready, the standards are set, the resources are in place and we will see continued improvement in what is so fundamental?  Everyone who enters a hospital should be aware of how important it is to be involved in the hygiene management programme.  Is there a sufficiently robust programme in every hospital as a result of this third audit?</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_122">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_249">I wish to point out that this is the first national hygiene services quality review report from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the new agency the Government promised.  This report cannot be compared with the previous ones because it was carried out on a different basis.  The report is part of an important new development in the Irish health service that will see standards set, monitored and reported on objectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The report gives the results of the review conducted in the 51 acute hospitals between March and September.  While hospitals generally performed well in the areas of hygiene and in-service delivery, the results on governance were poor — that aspect was not included in previous reports.  This contributed to disappointing overall results.  While improvements have been made and are acknowledged in the report, no hospital received a very good rating.  Seven were categorised as good, 35 as fair and nine as poor.  The clear message of the report is that hospital managers and health boards must take hygiene and infection control seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The method of assessment and the criteria used in the latest report are substantially different and, rightly, more onerous than those pertaining to the previous audits carried out by the Health Service Executive, HSE, and the results, therefore are not comparable.  Previous audits concentrated only on service delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The review also includes assessments of corporate management to ensure efforts at governing, identifying, managing and reducing infections are sustained.  Hospitals should concentrate more on these matters because while hospitals generally perform well on hygiene, governance is poor.  The audit shows that there are weaknesses in some hospitals relating to the priority placed on hospital hygiene — that is the governance issue.  Today's report gives us an opportunity to impress upon the management of each hospital the improvements that must be made to make hospitals cleaner.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">I agree with Deputy Kenny's comments on the superiority of the old system of matrons and religious orders and I worked under such a regime.  They moved heaven and earth on the wards to ensure hygiene prevailed and my generation will remember the smell associated with hospital hygiene that is no longer evident today.</p>

          <p eId="para_255">This will serve as notice to corporate management in hospitals to make hygiene a far higher priority in the coming months and years.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I welcome HIQA's emphasis on a whole-system approach to hygiene, which makes this the most comprehensive quality review of any kind in Ireland.  The review is intended to provide a detailed assessment of performance across the entire range of areas that impact upon hygiene so individual hospitals can identify areas of strength and areas that need improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The challenge laid down by this new report, the first of its kind, is for management, from senior management down through the system, to do far better.  The report also aims to see contractors in hospitals abiding by far higher standards — they are, frankly, being paid enough and should abide by the standards set by HIQA.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">The Health Information and Quality Authority is the organisation to drive standards and to fight the difficulties posed by hygiene problems, MRSA and other infections in the health system not only in this country but in other countries.  This report has set the benchmark against which people will be judged and improvements are needed, particularly in the area of governance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_259">I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to what he said in his reply.  The first two reports were carried out for the HSE by external contractors from the UK.  This report was carried out by HIQA, which evolved from the Health Service Accreditation Board, using peer review group systems here so it is more robust.  The Taoiseach suggests the first two reports cannot be compared to the latest one but the Department of Health and Children terms this audit as the third report.  The Department of Health and Children and the HSE relied on standards set in the previous two reports, which were conducted for the HSE by external contractors.  If the figures in the first two reports were inaccurately positive, the Department of Health and Children deems this as HIQA's report.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The Taoiseach has not said whether he is satisfied that every hospital has a real hygiene management programme.  He mentioned that contractors are paid enough to do their jobs but does he not feel that to realise the high standards to which everyone is entitled, pay should be related to reform of the health service?  This does not appear to be Government policy in other areas regarding performance and pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Problems like this will arise because hospitals here operate at 100% occupancy while international best practice suggests 85% is the correct level.  This is a problem in many hospitals; for example, Beaumont Hospital where one in three patients with MRSA cannot be isolated due to a lack of beds.  This is a cause of huge concern for people attending hospital for treatment.  The infection control team in Beaumont Hospital says that due to overcrowding, staff shortages and poor compliance with hand hygiene, outbreaks of otherwise preventable infections have occurred.  However, it is good to note that many hospitals provide the appropriate solution with which visitors can wash their hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, notes that Ireland has 2.8 acute hospital beds per 1,000 people compared to the OECD average of 3.9.  Does the Taoiseach accept that more hospital beds are needed to allow trained specialist cleaners deal with the high levels of bed occupancy?</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Does the Taoiseach accept, despite the many promises of his Government and the absent Minister for Health and Children, this report is another indication of his failure to implement a management system which oversees a public hospital hygiene programme that will stand up to scrutiny?  I am glad that the inspections were unannounced but an ongoing hospital hygiene programme is needed.  Will inspections of private hospitals be carried out in the same manner?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_126">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_264">There was no report before the previous two reports and the reason we wanted to tackle the hygiene problem in hospitals was that there were no benchmarks.  There was no league table to help us examine the health service and enforce standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The point I made on my first intervention was that the method of assessment and criteria used in this report are substantially different from and more demanding than the previous audits carried out by the HSE.  I support that, but my point is that they are not comparable and, therefore, neither are the results.  Previous audits concentrated totally on service delivery.  Issues of governance, management and the need to reduce infection must be considered.  That is a better way of doing it.  Nevertheless, there is huge room for improvement.  The overriding message in this report is that most hospitals can and should do better.  The criteria that now pertain under the national hygiene services quality review will be followed up into the future.  That sets a new standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">We have stated that we will provide, in the lifetime of this Government, additional staffing to deal with health care acquired infections, particularly MRSA.  We are working to ensure the Health Information Quality Authority sets and enforces a clear standard for health and information and that the new system of licences will put a strong emphasis on infection control.  HIQA will work to reduce significantly health care acquired infections in hospitals.  We must take into account the need to guard against infection in the refurbishment of existing hospitals and the construction of new hospitals.  The authority will establish a specific financial incentive that will reward hospitals that achieve excellence in hygiene standards, thus ensuring management concentrates on hygiene as a major issue.  HIQA will continue to carry out regular hygiene audits without notice, at minimum annually, and will publish the results.  It will also introduce measures to reduce the prescribing of antibiotics, which is part of the problem in terms of health care acquired infections.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">It should be noted that, according to the service delivery section of the report, most hospitals achieved either extensive or exceptional compliance with the standards.  The majority of hospitals have a multidisciplinary team in place to oversee hygiene practices, but most of these teams were newly established and roles and responsibilities were not clearly defined.  We have some way to go to embed that culture and practice of measuring, monitoring and improving.  Where risks were identified, these were notified to the individual hospitals and are receiving attention.  A quality improvement plan must now be drawn up by all hospitals individually and collectively by the HSE.  This will continue to be monitored by HIQA as part of its ongoing quality assurance efforts.  The establishment of HIQA means we are now seeing a regulatory management system being put in place.  This will force hospitals into a position where they must take account of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">The issue raised by Beaumont Hospital and other hospitals regarding hygiene, particularly hand hygiene in wards, is important.  One of the reasons for limited visiting hours in hospitals in previous times was to control hygiene matters.  This is no longer the case and people can visit for extensive hours during the day.  Hand hygiene issues are difficult to enforce when that happens, as we have been told by hospital management.  It is something that must be enforced, however, because, according to this and other reports, it is one of the most important issues in maintaining hygiene standards in hospital wards.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_127">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_269">In recent weeks there has been much public debate about the quality and adequacy of cancer care services.  It is fair to say that public confidence in these services is low.  The solution proposed by almost everybody is the notion of centres of excellence.  It is the strategy being put forward by the Government and the HSE, and all political parties as well as most medical professionals have subscribed to the idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">However, I am not clear as to what the Government means by "centres of excellence".  How many such centres will there be?  Professor O'Higgins spoke about 12 in his first report but the HSE now seems to have eight in mind.  The announcement by the executive in September identified eight "designated cancer care centres".  Will these be the eight centres of excellence?  Has the Government approved those eight centres?  What is the position regarding the north west?  The Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Devins, seemed to indicate that Sligo will be added to the list at some point.  Will there be nine centres of excellence rather than eight?</p>
          <p eId="para_271">In regard to the timescale, the HSE has stated that all cancer care services will be transferred to these eight centres by the end of 2009.  Where does this leave cancer care services that are being provided in private facilities?  Is it intended that they will continue separately or will they also be transferred to the centres of excellence?  How will we know that a centre of excellence has been deemed to be such?  Will there be some statement to the effect that there is now a centre of cancer care excellence in Hospital X?  Is there some formal process by which it will be communicated to the public that these centres of excellence are in operation?</p>
          <p eId="para_272">What is the budget?  The chairman of the working group overseeing the plan, Mr. O'Brien, says that no costings or budget have yet been worked out for its implementation.  Professor Keane, the interim director of the cancer care programme, says transitional funding will be needed in the next two years to bring the centres of excellence into being.  However, it seems no budget has been identified.  How will they be funded?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_128">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_273">I will try to answer as many of the Deputy's questions as possible.  In June, the Minister for Health and Children approved the national quality assurance standards for symptomatic breast disease services under the Health Act.  The aim of the standards is to ensure that every woman who develops breast cancer has an equal opportunity to be treated in a centre that is capable of delivering the best possible outcome.  In September, arising from the designation of cancer centres and to comply with those standards, the HSE directed 13 hospitals with low case volumes — fewer than 20 procedures — to cease breast cancer services immediately, to be followed by a further staged reduction in the number of hospitals providing cancer services from 22 to eight.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Several of these hospitals have in practice already discontinued or are in the process of discontinuing symptomatic breast services.  The National Hospitals Office has already planned the redirection of this symptomatic case load.  Additional groups of hospitals will be similarly directed, and this process will go on, as the Deputy observed, for the next year or two.  That will be done in line with the further development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres.  The HSE plans to have completed 60% of that transition from the current 22 to eight designated breast centres by the end of next year, and 90% by the end of the following year.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Discussions between the HSE and the four managed cancer control networks will focus on identifying the capacity issues for the eight designated centres so that a detailed transitional plan can be put in place to facilitate a progressive and carefully managed transfer of services in the next two years.  That work has not yet been undertaken but it is the next issue.  The HSE announced last week that within weeks, breast care services will be transferred in some of these hospitals and this will happen progressively.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">In regard to cost, the development and improvement of diagnostic and treatment services for breast cancer patients is a major priority development for cancer care services.  The national breast screening programme, combined with the quality-assured symptomatic breast disease services I have mentioned, is a key element of the cancer control programme.  Resources totalling €60 million have been put into this already.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The next stage begins when Professor Keane takes up his role on Monday.  When he examines the work over the next six weeks or so, he is expected to designate the national clinical leaders for radiation, surgery and medical oncology.  Arrangements are in hand to enable him to take control of all cancer services between now and the Christmas period.  From 1 January he will take charge of all existing cancer services and related funding and staffing.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">He will start with the work done to date and take over everything as it progresses into 2008.  As I understand it, he intends to designate the locations for a range of cancer specialties by early January, so he must make that call at that time when he is fully briefed on the position and the ongoing work.  As soon as he arrives, he will engage in detailed planning to facilitate these designations and the orderly phased transfer of services between the locations.  He plans to have completed 50% of that transition of services to cancer centres next year and 90% of the transition by the following year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_279">The Taoiseach has described how we will have fewer centres providing cancer services.  He has not said how these remaining eight or nine centres will be better.  That is what the public wants to know about.  For the past week or more we have been speaking about centres of excellence, and the expectation is that these will be better facilities than we have currently.  How will they be better?</p>
          <p eId="para_280">For example, last week it was announced that the service in Mullingar was to be discontinued and patients would be transferred to the Mater Hospital.  What has happened in the Mater that will lead to a better service?  Has it received extra equipment as a result of this?  Will there be extra staff or is it just a case of the hospital having extra patients?  How will the service be better in hospitals that will simply have extra patients?</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The Taoiseach noted Professor Keane is due to start on 1 January.  What budget will he have to provide the new and better services people are being led to believe will be provided?  The difficulty is that there is now a general concern about the quality and availability of cancer care services, and there is a programme to reduce the number of centres where such services are being provided.  This is being led on the basis that there will be centres of excellence but how will these centres be better?</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Is this just a rationalisation of the number of centres and a reduction in the number of centres without the service in the larger centres necessarily being better?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_130">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_283">Professor Keane will take over the entire budget.  Every year we have allocated more resources, both in capital and on the current side.  Much of this relates to staff.  Last week I may have said 120 consultants were taken on, but 111 consultants have been taken on.  The problem is these consultants are spread about in the system.  It is important to emphasise that the decision to reorganise the service is about achieving optimum outcomes.  It is not in itself a value judgment on work being done in the existing centres, some of which have a relatively large caseload at present but will not be part of the future centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The bottom line is that to achieve the very best outcomes, we must concentrate all cancer work in just the eight centres.  That necessarily means that there must be reorganisation and resources must be applied.  The discussion on management, designation and operational procedures must take place before these centres move.  The relevant individuals will be involved with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">We have progressively been reducing the number of centres, and we have already moved the number to 13.  The object is to quickly designate the clinical national leaders for radiation, surgical and medical oncology.  This is to ensure that in each centre there will be people who will be responsible, who will have a primary role along with Professor Keane.  They will be responsible for radiation, surgical and medical oncology services.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">We have been told there are multidisciplinary teams in some centres at present but this will bring such teams to work together.  They will have the resources and the throughput.  The argument is that the more patients being dealt with in centres, the more expertise is built up and we get quality staff.  Without denigrating staff at any centres, this system attracts people with expertise and competence who can carry caseloads.  They clearly need other facilities but that issue is being dealt with by the management of the various hospitals and the HSE.</p>

The Taoiseach indicated that the referendum would be held in the first half of 2008.  This is a crucial challenge where the people of this country will make their decision on the treaty.  As there is a maximum of 25 weeks, we should know approximately when the referendum will take place.  We do not want to know the exact date but will it be after Easter and before the summer?

I said previously that I would like to hold the two referendums on the one day if possible; the timing is a matter to be discussed by party leaders.  We face a challenge in dealing with this and when it should be.  It must be some time in the summer or early autumn because it must be ratified by 2008.  We have a calendar year to deal with the issue.  It will not be any earlier because if the treaty is signed in Lisbon or Brussels in December, we must have a referendum Bill and a referendum commission must be established while we get through the legislative work programme.  It will take some months.  I am happy, however, to discuss the issue.  If we can do them together we will.  It is not essential but it would be useful because the party leaders all made a commitment in April that we would deal with the children's issue within a year and there is a commitment to deal with the treaty in 2008.</p>

Meanwhile, the section of the Local Government Act that deals with the numbers of members of local authorities has not yet been commenced.  In the meantime, political parties and those considering standing for local elections do not know what the boundaries will be.  Will the Taoiseach bring some clarity to the issue soon?  If we must wait for a Green Paper, then a White Paper, then a report from the Boundary Commission, the local elections will be upon us.

Will it be reintroduced?  It differs somewhat from the sale of alcohol Bill and pertains to the promotion of alcohol to young people.  It should be dealt with in light of the present position in which Ireland is the second highest consumer of alcohol in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Second, in light of the fact that Kerry Radio, which now owns Northern Sound and Shannonside, has withdrawn news programmes from air, when will the broadcasting Bill be introduced to this House in order that Members at least can discuss openly what constitutes its remit?</p>

As the Members' custodian in the House, the Ceann Comhairle will be greatly concerned about this issue.  There is a growing tendency in Departments to provide Members with replies to the effect that the relevant Minister has no responsibility to the House.  Like the Taoiseach, me, and a number of others, the Ceann Comhairle has been a Member for a number of years.  A Minister is responsible to the House for every penny that is spent by his or her Department.  This should be borne in mind because any attempt to close down the avenue of replies to questions of the Opposition is a serious matter.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnGormley" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_223">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_391">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I am pleased to open the debate in this House on the Local Government (Roads Functions) Bill 2007.  On the formation of the Government in June 2007, the Taoiseach announced that responsibility for non-national roads and the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF, was to be transferred from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Department of Transport.  This Bill provides the necessary legislative framework to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for these functions from my Department to the Department of Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Following the Taoiseach's announcement, my Department engaged with the Department of Transport and the Office of the Attorney General to work out the legal and practical arrangements for the transfer.  Advice from the Attorney General's office was that the transfer of functions relating to both non-national roads and the NVDF required some minor amendment of the primary legislation in addition to the making of a transfer of functions order under the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1939.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The drafting of the necessary transfer of functions order is well advanced with the intention of making the order to coincide with enactment of the Bill.  The Bill is technical in nature.  In summary, it provides for amendment of the Local Government Act 1998 to allow for payments from the local government fund to the Minister for Transport in respect of, first, non-national roads and, second, the Minister's expenses in maintaining NVDF records, administering motor vehicle tax and issuing driver licences.  The Bill also provides a statutory basis for the Minister for Transport to make regulations in respect of the NVDF functions being transferred to him.  The Bill also vests in the Minister for Transport all ministerial consent provisions in respect of railway orders where the works involved are likely to affect public roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I wish to explain the necessity for the Bill to be enacted within a short time frame.  The Department of Finance has notified a deadline of mid to late November for enactment of the Bill to allow that Department the time necessary to make budgetary adjustments consequent on the transfer of functions in the 2007 and 2008 Votes of my Department and the Department of Transport.  The enactment of this Bill and the making of the transfer of functions order will allow spending provisions for non-national roads and the NVDF to be definitively transferred to the Vote of the Department of Transport.  In this way, statutory responsibility for these expenditure provisions will transfer to the Department of Transport.  In due course, expenditure Estimates to be presented to the House will reflect these changes.  I thank Deputies for their co-operation in facilitating early consideration of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Following the general election in 2002, most of the departmental administration and ministerial functions in the areas of roads, road traffic and road safety were transferred from the then Department of the Environment and Local Government to the then Department of Public Enterprise, now the Department of Transport.  At that time, it was decided that functions relating to regional and local roads should remain with the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  The primary reason for this was that State grants for non-national roads were mainly financed from the local government fund, which is administered by my Department.  The Government has decided that overall responsibility for the non-national roads investment programme should be vested in the Minister with responsibility for overall transport development.  There is no longer any rationale for having two separate Ministers and Departments with responsibility for different aspects of the public road network.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">One of the primary purposes of this Bill is to facilitate the transfer of the non-national roads function to the Minister for Transport and also the payment of associated State grants by that Minister.  In the matter of funding for the non-national roads investment programme, I assure the House there will be no negative impact as a result of the new arrangements.  While responsibility for non-national roads is being transferred to the Department of Transport, the local government fund will continue to provide significant finance for these roads.  This year alone, in addition to €87.5 million from the Exchequer, €520 million is being provided from the local government fund.  This will be the benchmark for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The NVDF is a database of national strategic importance which contains details of all the 2.4 million registered vehicles and 2.5 million licensed drivers in the country.  The NVDF is the product of a major computerisation project which was completed in my Department in 2002.  The system enables all vehicle and driving licence transaction processing to be updated in real time.  The NVDF is critical to the management of the national motor tax and driver licence services, including the optimisation of these services for the motoring public.  NVDF data now plays a key role in vehicle and driver regulation and in supporting the critical road safety agenda and it is in these contexts that the Government deemed it appropriate that the system and its support staff should transfer from my Department to the Department of Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">The primary purpose of section 1 is to amend the Local Government Act 1998 to allow for the payment of moneys from the local government fund to the Minister for Transport in respect of non-national roads and that Minister's expenses in maintaining NVDF records, administering motor vehicle tax and issuing driver licences.  These expenses are currently being met from the fund and this will continue after the transfer of functions to the Minister for Transport.  Section 1 also ensures that moneys received by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Transport in the context of the motor tax and NVDF functions continue to be paid into the local government fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Deputies will be aware of the important role the local government fund has played in the financing of local government since it was established in 1999.  The fund is financed from a combination of an Exchequer contribution — €537 million in 2007 — and the full proceeds of motor taxation, projected at €944 million for this year.  The general purpose grant allocation to local authorities from the fund for 2007 amounts to €948 million.  This represents an increase of 8% over the record amount provided in 2006 and is an increase of some 180% over the 1997 allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">It is critically important that the improvements that have been brought about in the financing of local authorities, current and capital, are built upon.  In this context, it is essential the local government fund, which has been pivotal in this success, is in no way compromised by the transfer of functions.  I assure the House that this will be the case.  As heretofore, motor tax and the Exchequer will continue to provide resources to the fund, which will continue to provide a robust, buoyant and dedicated source of funding for local authorities by way of general purpose grants and non-national roads grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Section 2 contains amendments to the Roads Act 1920 which are required to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for the NVDF to the Minister for Transport.  Under current legislation, the power to make regulations for the control and regulation of the motor tax system, which includes change of vehicle ownership, is vested in the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the 1920 Act.  Notifications of vehicle ownership changes are an essential part of the maintenance and updating of the national vehicle file.  With the transfer of responsibility for the NVDF to the Minister for Transport, it is necessary also to transfer responsibility for making regulations in the area of vehicle ownership records and related matters.  The purpose of section 2 is to amend the Roads Act 1920 accordingly.  The opportunity is also taken in this section to update definitions in section 17 of the 1920 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Arising from the transfer of functions in the area of non-national roads, I will no longer have a function in respect of public roads.  Section 3 makes a minor amendment to the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 to provide that ministerial consent to the granting of a railway order, where the works in question would affect non-national roads, is to be vested in the Minister for Transport as the responsible Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I reiterate that this Bill is technical in nature and simply provides the necessary legislative framework to facilitate the transfer of the non-national roads and NVDF functions to the Minister for Transport.  The actual transfer of functions will be effected by a transfer order to be made by the Government.  Drafting of the necessary transfer of functions order is well advanced and the transfer order will be made to coincide with enactment of this Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_405">I do not agree with the Minister that the Bill is technical in nature.  It transfers a considerable amount of financial autonomy from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to another Minister.  In view of the size of the local government fund and the NVDF responsibilities, the Minister is effectively giving these away under an agreement made in the programme for Government that the non-national roads budget, consisting of the local government fund and Exchequer grants, will now be the responsibility of the Department of Transport.  This does not give me great confidence about the implementation of the road works programme in view of the fact that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, will be in charge of it.  The Bill is certainly more technical than it looks.  The recent mess made by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, in the area of provisional licences and the road safety programme does not inspire confidence in his ability to clear up the enormous number of anomalies in the NVDF system.  Thus, I regard this as much more than a technical Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">In view of the amount of money he is giving away to another Department, I am disappointed that the Minister did not take the opportunity in his contribution to say a few words about local government.  It was a missed opportunity, although that is a political cliché, to enact meaningful legislation which devolves functions to local government rather than discuss one item before the House which the Minister regards as technical in the context of non-national roads.  The Bill gives us an opportunity to talk about how local government works at present.  It says something about the Government's direction on devolution that these road network functions are being transferred to a Department that administers the budget of the NRA.  It was a mistake for the Green Party and for the Minister to allow this happen.  I do not accept that the National Roads Authority will be as sympathetic to the pleadings of local government as is the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  When the National Roads Authority is not accountable to this House in terms of even asking a parliamentary question about funding for various road projects, it shows how frustrating it will be, not only for Members of Parliament but for members of local authorities, trying to get straight answers to straight questions on a regular basis from the Department of Transport.  There has been a tradition, not without good reason, that the local councillors in city and urban areas, or in county councils around the country, are able to write to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ask that various water, sewerage or roads projects be undertaken.  These were the main infrastructural projects that were at the heart of local communities.  The substantial amount of money the Minister has decided to hive off from local government to the Department of Transport will make such representations all the more difficult.  In the absence of reform of the accountability system that is required from the Department of Transport, through the NRA, to this House and to local authorities, I have reservations about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Both of the measures should have been implemented at the same time, if we were to get some meaningful input with parliamentarians and councillors having an opportunity to raise important roads issues.  For example, the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, could meet the regional authority in the south east two years ago and make announcements about additional moneys being made available for designing important regional routes which come under the remit of the Local Government Fund as well as in the context of non-national roads.  That sort of engagement with the local authority system, albeit on a regional basis, was vital to ensure that local councillors were able to make the necessary improvements to the network, at regional and local levels that were important for business, for tourism and for the day to day journeys of people to and from their places of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">There has been much talk and many reports on local government over the years but there has been very little reform.  We started in a meaningful way with the Barrington report in 1991, in which various structures were proposed to organise the local government system.  Some of those proposals were implemented but they related mainly to geographical arrangements, such as splitting Dublin into three county areas and keeping Dublin City, and setting up the city structures with more meaningful boundaries.  There followed the "Better Local Government" system, which was brought before us by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, and subsequently implemented by the former Minister, Deputy Dempsey.  This involved setting up a system of local government that would give community groups much more meaningful input into activities at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">There is no point in having those structures when we are effectively taking away from the Department a funding mechanism for non-national and regional roads and giving it to another Department.  The direct line of communication is now cut off.  Notwithstanding the pressures the Minister is under from the Department of Finance to have this put through for budgetary and estimate reasons, I ask the Minister to tell us on the conclusion of Second Stage or on Committee Stage whether there will be reform of the National Roads Authority in terms of how it engages with parliamentarians and councils and whether we will have access to its staff as regards their additional, as well as existing, funding for national routes, and the principles which will govern them.  Local Government has stood the test of time.  It is more than 100 years old.  It is the form of government nearest to the citizen.  I have reservations about giving away that amount of money to another Department from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The Minister made a statement over the weekend that he would increase motor vehicle taxation in the context of the budgetary framework on the basis that it would be good for the environment.  He suggested it would be based on the engine capacity of the vehicle rather than on emissions of the vehicle.  If he is interested in environment issues, as I know he is, I would have thought that he would have taken the opportunity to speak about a form of taxation in the context of reforming the VRT system to ensure that people are penalised for higher emissions rather than for higher engine capacity.  That is a form of indirect taxation.  The Minister is taking the opportunity to gather in more money for the Exchequer when there is a declining amount of income, and here he will give it to the Department of Transport.</p>

Therefore, he will have no function in the spending of the money even though he has put his neck on the line over the weekend stating that he will charge more for the benefit of the Local Government Fund by increasing by an average of 10% the amount of taxation that will come in for engines with a capacity over 1.6 litres.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">The principles that should guide local government are important.  I believe strongly in the principle of subsidiarity and what the Minister is doing here is not in the best interests of subsidiarity in terms of local government.  There is no reform in terms of the transfer of functions referred to in this Bill and an opportunity should have been taken to include greater devolution of function.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Wherever a public service is provided to a defined catchment area there should be a representative body elected by the people to act as the governing body for that expenditure.  The citizens, through their elected representatives, should control and fund the services locally that are provided for them, and the people, through an adequately funded and functioning local government system, should be sovereign.  The Minister is seeking in this Bill to take away a significant portion of that funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Many quangos established some years ago to draw down local government funding through the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund are no longer required.  Partnership and other groups that were established to draw down that funding are not accountable to the local government system.  All of the funding drawn down by a community, an area based partnership, a Leader programme or any such programme should be accounted for in the local government system and I would ask the Minister to look at those functions in the context of whatever review of local government he will undertake in the future.  When he is giving away so much money, he is obviously not in any hurry with such a review.  Certainly, he should consider that all of the opportunities of groups and organisations to draw down funding in a geographical catchment area should be accounted for, through the local government system and the elected representatives, to the people.  That is the principle he should adopt.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The Minister may recall the devolution commission set up in 1996 that considered various functions that could be transferred to the local government system.  Nothing has happened since then.  This is typical of the usual lip service we hear about introducing more devolution to local government but where the Minister of the day does not walk the walk in terms of that policy.  I refer to the administration of various tourism and educational facilities, proper planning and development for health and educational services and industrial development.  All of these areas should be devolved more at a local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will remember the county development boards were set up for the purpose of co-ordinating funding from various State agencies and Departments.  However well the theory sounded, it was never put into practice in the local government system.  We are long enough around to know FÁS will not transfer part of its budget to a local authority for the purpose of implementing a community employment programme.  We also know the rural assistance budget of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, will not be transferred for the purpose of allowing a local authority to implement a programme that will assist rural communities to develop community activities.  Likewise, while the school building programme is co-ordinated at national level by the Department of Education and Science, there will not be any input by local authorities in regard to site provision.  The town of Callan, County Kilkenny, is seeking a health centre but the HSE will not transfer any of its functions to the local authority to ensure it has the appropriate site location to provide this essential medical facility for the community.  If we are serious about proper and accountable local government, these are the types of measures that should be examined in terms of devolving to local authorities some of the remits that are currently the responsibility of a variety of Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is seeking to transfer an amount of money from his Department to another Department without a "yea" or "nay".  This is a capitulation by the Green Party to its Fianna Fáil colleagues in terms of local government funding.  It is a disgrace to give that money to a Minister like Deputy Dempsey, who has demonstrated so much incompetence in his time in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  He compounded this by his efforts in the Department of Transport where he could not even get a road safety strategy right.  It is politically irresponsible of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to even contemplate giving anything to his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, notwithstanding the personal friendship he may have developed with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The transfer of funds might appear to be a necessary technical matter to comply with a discussion that took place some months ago in a smoke-filled room in which the programme for Government was concocted.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">The rooms were filled with smoke in terms of the discussions that took place on this measure.  In effect, the Minister is transferring a funding source from the Department.  This shows political naivety and weakness.  The Minister will not be able to implement some of the key measures required in the area of local government policy that require finance to back them up.  One cannot implement much change in local government without the money to do it.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Gormley, will let us know whether he has in mind the imposition of additional charges or other sources of funding for local government in the future.  Given the proposed transfer of funding to the Department of Transport, he certainly will not have access to a vital source of funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I look forward to hearing what the Minister will say regarding future accessibility of local government to the National Roads Authority.  Has this issue been discussed and thought through?  Is there reference in the small print to the Government's policy position on this matter?  I hope the Minister will return to the House at the earliest opportunity, not with an innocuous technical Bill like the proposed transfer of functions to the Department of Transport, but with a meaningful package of measures for local government reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">It is always a strange day when one witnesses the transfer of powers from one Department to another.  One must always ask what is the rationale underpinning the change.  The obvious reason for such a move is the creation of greater efficiency, reductions in cost or a benefit in terms of a better standard of service to citizens and local authorities.  In most cases, the change is for the better.  However, what we have seen recently, especially in the provisional drivers debacle, is a case of good ideas that are poorly implemented and delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I have several concerns with the proposal in hand, not so much in what it sets out to achieve but in how it will be rolled out.  Take the example of roads in my constituency of Cork South-Central, which reflects other constituencies around the country.  Housing estate after housing estate has been built on non-national roads and, in many cases, boreens.  This practice has been going on for decades.  When people come out of housing estates that have been built in the past 18 months to three years, they drive on new roads that may have been taken in charge by the local authority that will accommodate cars on both sides yet when they exit the estate they are on a boreen.  I hope the Bill will create some movement in this regard.  In 2009 the local area plans and county and city development plans will be examined on the basis of commercial, residential and community development.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The question is whether moving this responsibility to the Department of Transport will create a more efficient planning model or further exacerbate the disjointed planning we have had to date, namely, the building of housing estates on country laneways.  Quality bus corridors and park and ride facilities do not fit into this type of planning.  The Department of Transport appears to be growing by the day, and problems are increasing by the day in terms of the provisional licences and the Shannon debacles.  Does it need additional areas to come under its remit to be mismanaged?  It is unfortunate the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, is not present as the transfer of funding is a matter for his Department and he should be present to answer questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">What is the status of the transfer of the proceeds from the collection of motor vehicle tax from local authorities to the Minister for Transport?  Likewise, what is the position regarding the collection of fees for driving licences which has been carried out by local authorities?  Will the Minister for Transport take responsibility for the planning of what have become suburban roadways because housing estates have been built along them?  Where do they fit into the greater scheme of things?  It is necessary to clarify whether these roadways will be considered to be in suburban areas or if they will be classed as non-national roads.  Where will the responsibility lie in regard to the expenditure of funds for the maintenance of these roads?  Will local authorities who had responsibility for the planning of these roads, and who had accounted for them in their budgets, have to look for sanction from the Department of Transport?  Who will set the priority and be responsible for the planning and layout of roads?  I refer in particular to county and city development plans that are coming up for appraisal.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">In recent years we have witnessed significant congestion resulting from poor planning with regard to road services.  I remember when Transport 21 was announced; it was about 6.10 p.m. on a Monday.  This may not be the most appropriate thing to say but occasionally I fall asleep during the "Six-one" news.  Perhaps we all do that, although I should not say that as a public representative.  I was not sure whether I had woken up or was having a nightmare when I saw the then Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen, talking about €36 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_436">Something like that would frighten the life out of anyone.  The Minister, Deputy Cullen, who had the e-voting debacle under his belt along with another, was being awarded €36 billion of lolly.  What happened to that money and where does this plan fit in to Transport 21, or catch 21 as it is turning out to be?  In my part of the country the Cork commuter rail service to Midleton has been pushed back to 2009.  The flyovers at the Sarsfield Road and Bishopstown roundabouts appear to have disappeared off the map.  The local authorities have been given permission to survey the area but there does not appear to be any level of joined up thinking.  If one was building a house in the manner in which we do road development here we would get a loan from the credit union for the back door, get another loan some weeks later for some blocks and another one later on for cement.  There does not appear to be any overall project management plan, and the Kinsale Road roundabout is a case in point.  That project worked successfully but it is now hampered because the continuation projects are not in place.  Where is the joined up thinking in this transfer of functions for road works to the Department of Transport?</p>
          <p eId="para_437">On another matter, the park and ride issue requires local authorities and Bus Éireann to work out plans.  Does that now become an issue for the Department of Transport also?  I am not sure whether this transfer of functions should be viewed as a capitulation by the Minister's Department but an empire appears to be growing in the Department of Transport which is worrying and undermines to some extent the idea of subsidiarity and local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The purpose of the Bill, to which the Labour Party will table some minor amendments on Committee Stage, is something that affects people on a day to day basis.  When people who work hard all week come out at 7 o'clock in the morning to face a day's work and drop their children to school or child care, they need some sort of infrastructural development around their community.  They do not want to travel on boreens and roadways that are out of date, so to speak.  Improvement in these roadways has not been delivered to date.  The Transport 21 concept now appears to be pie in the sky.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I hope that as a result of this Bill, and I am not sure if it will happen, the National Roads Authority, the Minister for Transport, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities will operate in a joined up fashion in terms of developments and that the roadways in those developments will add to the quality of people's lives.  If that is to be an objective of the Bill, the Minister will have the support of the Labour Party but at this stage there are many doubts undermining it which we will address when we examine the Bill in detail.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_440">I want to raise a number of issues with the Minister about the rationale for this legislation.  There are implications for the transferring of this function to the Department of Transport but can the Department of Transport deal with these additional responsibilities?  The Department of Transport has become a vast empire.  A number of issues that have arisen there, for example, the disastrous privatisation of Aer Lingus and the implications for Shannon Airport and the whole region; the learner drivers fiasco; and the apparent inability of the Department to deliver on most of the Transport 21 projects.  With all that taking place, will the Department be capable of delivering any additional projects and functions on time and within budget?</p>
          <p eId="para_441">There is a history of transfer of functions into and out of the Department of Transport which has not been successful and would not inspire confidence in the ability of the Minister and his Department to successfully realise these additional functions.  For example, during the previous Dáil, responsibility for ports and marine transport was transferred from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the Department of Transport yet it appeared to fall into a black hole, so to speak, in that Department where it was not given adequate attention or resources.  Will that happen to the roads functions now being transferred?</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Deputy Lynch expressed concerns about the type of accountability that will arise regarding the building of these roads.  Who will be accountable if there are problems with them?  The Minister might clarify that because he did not refer to it in his contribution.  Where will the accountability arise if there are legal actions regarding issues that arise out of the maintenance or building of these roads in future?  Who will be the defendant in such actions?  Will the Minister clarify that?</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The Minister mentioned funding of roads building with the new transfer function and said that this year, in addition to the €87.5 million, there would be money from the local government fund.  He went on to say that this will be the benchmark going forward.  Are the Green Party Members getting into corporate speak now, which is difficult to decipher?  I want the use of the term "going forward" to be banned and the Minister should start with that.</p>

Does it mean there will be €87.5 million in the budget this year in addition to whatever would take into account the adjustment for the new economic situation?  Will that €87.5 million from the Exchequer plus the local government funding be in the budget this year?  I would like the Minister to clarify that.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">A few weeks ago there was a lengthy debate on road safety where a number of Deputies from throughout the country described in detail the dangerous nature of many of our non-national roads, especially in the west and north-west.  When the issue was raised the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, gave a commitment during that debate to drastically increase road safety measures but if there is not, at the very least, matched funding in this year's budget for building of non-national roads, that would go against the Minister's commitment, which would be unacceptable.  I would like the Minister to clarify the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">It should be pointed out that there are no provisions under Transport 21 for the maintenance and upgrading of non-national primary roads.  With the transfer of functions will that be given priority in terms of our traffic and transport commitments?</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Throughout the country motorists can drive along a major inter-urban route which has been upgraded to a very high standard but when they come on to a non-national road they are often faced with poorly maintained and dangerous stretches of road on which they must complete their journey.  Will the Minster give that issue priority with the transfer of the functions to the Department of Transport?</p>
          <p eId="para_450">On the national vehicle and driver file, there were disturbing reports in the media recently about the impact of uninsured drivers on road deaths and road safety.  Recently, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that 1,351 vehicles recorded as written off on the national vehicle and driver file were back on Irish roads.  Has the Department of Transport-led investigation into this matter been concluded and what recommendations were made?</p>
          <p eId="para_451">What plans are there to reform the NVDF to take recent events into account?  Is the Minister considering the Motor Insurance Bureau's recommendation that the Road Safety Authority take charge of the file?  The automobile authority has called on the Government to introduce a new non-national driver file to maintain a record of penalty points for those producing foreign licences following motoring offences in Ireland.  Is the Government considering this type of reform?</p>

We should welcome the publication of the Local Government (Roads Functions) Bill 2007, the main feature of which is to provide for necessary legislative amendments of a technical nature to facilitate the transfer of non-national roads and the NVDF to the remit of the Minister for Transport.  The Bill is required to give effect to the Taoiseach's announcement on the formation of the Government in June, which seems a long time ago, that responsibility for non-national roads and the NVDF was to be transferred from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">It is important to make these points.  While not being critical of the Minister, there is work to be done in terms of devolution of responsibility to local authorities.  The debate about too much authority and power being vested in county managers will continue for some time.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I am glad that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is present.  I applaud the work he has done since the formation of the Government and I wish him well in his role.

          <p eId="para_463">I was going to mention it and the Minister is welcome to use it.  Thank God for it.  The Minister has been to Tallaght, but he will see on Friday that it is a different place from the one to which I moved years ago.  It is a vibrant city in everything but name.  The Minister has opinions on whether Tallaght should be a city, but he and I must agree to disagree on that fundamental point during the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country.  We have facilities and services in Tallaght to be expected in a major town, but I have listed them in other debates.  Anyone who visits Tallaght knows it to be vibrant.  While we have good roads and infrastructure and the Luas, there are gaps——</p>

          <p eId="para_470">I will get to it.  My preamble relates to it because it is important to stress the progress made in many communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Deputies will mention their constituencies during the debate.  They will refer to good elements, but they will also refer to challenges.  Deputy Ciarán Lynch referred to boreens.  While there are not many boreens in Tallaght, there are quite a few poor roads.  At a time when significant progress is being made in terms of national roads, as seen by Deputies while driving around the country, there are gaps in terms of non-national roads.  There is much work to be done, a point I hope the Minister will make before he passes this file to his colleague in the Department of Transport.  I expect many colleagues to make this point during the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I could bring the Minister around Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue or Greenhills.  When people, even those in new communities, get up in the morning and drive to school, to the shops or about their business — sometimes, I walk to the Luas, but I drive when the weather is inclement — they face poor roads.  I could bring the Minister to as many potholes in my major urban area as a Deputy could bring him to in Roscommon, Thurles, Tipperary or Cork.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charlie O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_474">It is important that we understand the challenge.  If we are making progress with the national roads, there is a strong case to be made for the Department to consider a five year or ten year framework in which local authorities, particularly South Dublin County Council, could know that they will get a certain amount of money to allow them to deal with the non-national roads challenge in an effective way.  This challenge includes sorting out the roads and footpaths.  Last night during my constituency work in Springfield where I live, I met an 87 year old man who had fallen on a footpath.  It was installed approximately 30 years ago and is in poor condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">It is fair to make such points because major roads have been paid much attention.  While driving up the Newry road for the first time in a long while to attend the recent SDLP conference, I marvelled at the progress made.  However, one can find poor roads and boreens in every constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">In the context of the forthcoming budget, people may state that the economy is tightening, but there has been unprecedented wealth.  While local authorities have been well funded, there will always be room for more.  We need to deal with the issues people want us to address in our agendas.  It is true that there are non-national roads in south Dublin and Tallaght that must be dealt with quickly.  It is not a matter of patchwork, which is being carried out and of which every Deputy can give examples.  A more fundamental approach should be taken to this problem.  County managers and councillors should know on a five year or ten year basis what amounts will be made available to get work done.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I do not want to be too parochial, but I get around my constituency as much as anyone does.  One wonders what the professionals are doing.  I could bring someone to Firhouse where a great deal of work has been done at the Old Mill on the Old Bawn Road and elsewhere.  With all of the public money expended on that road, why will it not be turned into a larger carriageway and why will there not be further scope to get rid of traffic?  Everyone who must use his or her car, whether early in the morning or late at night, knows of difficulties to be addressed.  There are side issues, such as the question of why people drive their children to school 100 yards away, which occurs in every constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Like other Deputies, I will not be afraid to mention the recent issues concerning driver testing.  People spoke about it while I went about my business in recent weeks.  In reporting this debate to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, Deputy Gormley should mention that it is an issue and people are talking about it.  In every community learner drivers face up to the new challenges, wonder how they will get their tests and how effective the system will be, and it is fair to make the point.  I do not say it should be easy for people to pass their tests, but they should be able to get a test.  I come from a generation in which one was able to get a test easily.  I did not pass the first time and that is okay.  At least one was not waiting forever for a test.  There are still problems with how testing is organised.  In a recent Dáil debate I said a friend of mine who lives near Bray applied for a test and was sent to Naas.  That makes no sense and I do not understand how professionals can make those kinds of decisions.  It is fair that I mention it.  Where there are difficulties with these systems we should not be afraid to say so.</p>

However I did not want to join the Opposition because I would have to complain about everything.  I am happy to represent my community in a constructive way and try to achieve for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The Bill provides for an amendment of the Local Government Act 1998 to allow for payments from the local government fund to the Minister for Transport in respect of non-national roads and Minister's expenses in maintaining the NVDF records, administering motor vehicle tax and issuing driver licences.  These expenses are being met from the fund and the legislation provides for the administration of these expenses following the transfer of functions.  The Bill provides a statutory basis for the Minister for Transport to make regulations on the NVDF functions being transferred to him.  The Bill vests in the Minister for Transport all ministerial consent provisions in respect of railway orders where the works involved are likely to affect public roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Earlier I mentioned the non-national roads issue.  Following the 2002 general election most of the Department administration and ministerial functions on roads, road traffic and road safety were transferred from the then Department of the Environment and Local Government to the then Department of Public Enterprise, now the Department of Transport.  There is no longer any rationale for having two Ministers and Departments dealing with aspects of the public road network.  The Government decided responsibility for the non-national road investment programme should be vested in the Minister for Transport, and the Bill provides for the administration of these expenses following the transfer of functions.  It provides for a statutory basis for the Minister for Transport to make regulations on the NVDF functions being transferred to him.  The Bill vests in the Minister for Transport all ministerial consent provisions in respect of railway orders where the works are likely to affect public roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">I am not afraid to say that I have the same problems and frustrations as many Deputies in dealing with agencies where functions of the Department, particularly the Department of Transport have been hived off.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">I did not set them up and we must deal with the existing systems.  It frustrates me when I table Dáil questions and the Ceann Comhairle's office has to tell us the Minister does not have responsibility in these matters.  A process must be found to deal with our concerns and issues.  There have recently been issues on road development, road safety and driver testing on which it was legitimate for all of us to ask questions and try to achieve what we want because people are talking to us about it.  It seems a long time since these systems were established and while some of them work, there are gaps.  I share the same frustrations on trying to get information as other Members on both sides of the House.  There are Ministers who try to help us and get the information to us, but sometimes it is difficult.  We could talk about the HSE all day, but I do not want the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to throw me out.  It comes into this discussion, but I will let it pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The Minister said the NVDF is a database of national strategic importance.  It contains details of all 2.4 million registered vehicles and 2.5 million licensed drivers in Ireland.  It is the product of a major computerisation project which was completed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2002.  The system enables all vehicle and driving licence transaction processing to be updated in real time.  It is critical to the management of the national motor tax and driving licence services including the optimisation of these services to the motoring public.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">I come from a different Dublin in a different generation when there was hardly a car on the street.  I remember the horses on the street and the trams before the tracks were pulled up.  Now everybody has a car.  When I first moved to Tallaght hardly anybody had a car, and I did not have one.  Now every house has three or four cars and that adds to the challenge.  Anybody who tries to drive in the morning or evening knows the difficulties this entails.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The data in the NVDF plays a key role in vehicle and driver regulation and supporting the critical road safety agenda.  In this context the Government deemed it appropriate that the system and its support staff transfer from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Department of Transport.  This Bill is necessary to give effect to the transfer of functions relating to non-national roads and the NVDF to the Department of Transport.  The Government will make a transfer order to coincide with the enactment of the Bill.  I am glad this Bill is being supported on the Government benches, and if I have listened carefully to most of the speeches from the Opposition there is a measure of support there and that is fair.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_502">I wish to stick specifically to the Bill and deal with the provisions for the national vehicle and driver file.  Data on penalty points is held on the driver file and, as it currently operates, this file is fundamentally flawed.  A quarter of all drivers who qualified for penalty points could not receive them as they do not hold an Irish driving licence.  We are allowing 25% of drivers who are breaching the law to get away scot free.  All over the country we see lunatics overtaking on continuous white lines and travelling at the speed of light, yet many of their registration plates are Northern Irish, British or continental European.  These people can come in to the jurisdiction and give two fingers to the Garda Síochána and to Irish road traffic legislation, as we have not been prepared to address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">This Government has been in office for ten years and we have had ten years of road safety strategies.  It promised in its original strategy that it would address this issue, but nothing has happened since.  This has led to a litany of road traffic accidents, yet we are  not prepared to do anything about it.  This place has turned into a talking shop.  The Minister for Transport will come before this House and say that we are discussing the issue with the Northern Ireland authorities, the British authorities and at EU level.  These discussions have gone on for ten years, but nothing has happened to address the problem.  People are getting away with breaking the law thanks to the system that is there at the moment, yet we continue to ignore it and brush it under the carpet.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">This also applies to motor insurance.  There are currently 100,000 vehicles on Irish roads without any insurance.  Up to end of September 2007, 6,539 people had received penalty points for driving uninsured.  Given that a quarter of drivers on our roads are exempt from the laws of this country as we cannot attach penalty points to their licences, many of these uninsured will get away scot free.  The failure of 100,000 people to insure their vehicles costs the rest of us an additional €45 per annum, but we could address a quarter of them if penalty points were attached to drivers from outside this jurisdiction and if there was an up to date national vehicle and driver file.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">This is not the only road safety issue in which promises have been ignored.  In their contributions, the Minister and Deputy O'Connor made the point that the national vehicle and driver file is critical to support the road safety agenda in this country.  It should be updated and modernised, and we should be able to deal with foreign drivers in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">There is also a problem with people using driving licences as a form of identification for other breaches of the law.  A five year old could forge our driving licences.  I could get a forged Irish driving licence in the morning for €10.  It is farcical to think that there is any security involved in it.  All drivers are now required by law to carry their licences, a piece of paper that crumples easily.  In 2003, the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, promised us that a credit card sized driving licence would be in place by 2004.  The Minister said at the time that he was determined to have it in place by then.  When I contacted the Road Safety Authority on this issue last week, I was told that the new directive means that it is not required to be in place until 2013, and that it is the objective to have it in place by 2012.  We were promised this in 2004, but we will have to wait eight years before it is in place.  In the meantime, that form of identification is an insult to anybody's intelligence.  It is being blatantly flouted and those people on false licences cannot be given penalty points.  The whole system is a farce.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Law abiding citizens in this country can be one or two miles per hour over the speed limit at the edge of a town, yet they receive penalty points from a garda taking the soft option.  The people who give two fingers to the law do not receive points, which is something we cannot continue to ignore.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">I would like to make a final point about the notification of change of ownership and vehicles that have been written off.  More than 1,000 vehicles in the State have been written off, but are put back on the road.  This cannot be ignored and is causing huge road safety problems.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I would like to support Deputy Hogan's stance on this Bill.  In seeking to rush it through the Houses, the Government is once again shelving responsibility and enforcing the "Dublin knows best" mentality at the expense of the autonomy of local authorities.  The main purpose of the Local Government (Roads Functions) Bill 2007 is to make legislative changes that are required to enable the transfer of responsibility for non-national roads and the national vehicle and driver file to the Department of Transport.   One could of course point out that it is rare for this Government to take responsibility for anything.  It is interesting though that the Minister is finally embracing transparency and admitting that his Department has made a total mess of roads infrastructure, especially on our rural roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">I am all in favour of the recent spate of U-turns by this lame-duck Government and even sympathetic to the Minister's need for therapeutic confusion, but at the end of the day, local authorities are not pawns in a political game of expediency, with responsibility being shifted from one Department to another to the detriment of local autonomy.  According to figures in the Government's pre-budget outlook, local authorities are facing a cut of more than 13% in funding for non-national roads, the routes which constitute 94% of the overall road network and carry 60% of all traffic.  Pre-budget figures show that the budget for non-national roads will fall from €87.5 million this year to €53.8 million next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">We are being told that the urgency of rushing through this legislation is to facilitate the Department of Finance in the necessary budgetary adjustments.  Does this herald a divide and conquer approach, with cutbacks slipping in by default?  Funding of €253,771 promised for Longford's rural roads was slashed in post-election cutbacks while €11,892 was taken from funding for Westmeath roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The Minister, hastening to appear accountable, will claim this is the responsibility of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs as the moneys are allocated under the local improvement scheme as part of the CLÁR programme.  I do not care which way the Minister spins it or manipulates change to his advantage.  The bottom line is that our roads, in particular non-national roads, are a disgrace.  Rural communities are suffering economic deprivation due to the state of our roads.  Communities are being isolated by a lack of necessary infrastructure and many roads are in a deplorable condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">I have made numerous representations for the upgrading of non-national roads in the Longford-Westmeath area, many of which are in a prehistoric condition.  Continual representations to the Department have still not brought the upgrading of the roads in the midlands, essential to the region's economic growth.  Gateway and hub towns have been created in isolation with no real effort to develop links between them.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The Bill provides for the transfer of the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF, to the Department of Transport.  This is to be welcomed as there has been a lack of engagement by NVDF staff under the watch of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  While any plan to deal with the inadequacies in the NVDF is a step in the right direction, the Road Safety Authority recommended a new agency be established to rectify the problems.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business recommended the creation of a motor vehicle agency as a partial solution to the problem of uninsured drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The European Commission's motor insurance directives require the State to develop an accurate central insurance database on every vehicle in the State.  This project, known as the information centre, is deficient due to problems with the NVDF.  The Irish Insurance Federation has brought difficulties with the database to the attention of the Department, recommending responsibility for it be given to the Road Safety Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">The Garda does not have access to an accurate central database of insurance information, essential to the maintenance of roadside checkpoints.  Uninsured drivers kill up to 20 people each year and leave a further 2,000 seriously injured according to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland.  There is evidence that a large number of owners of foreign-registered vehicles retain their domestic registration, renewing insurance in their home country.  Foreign insurers refuse to pay claims on the grounds that the driver is resident in Ireland and provided incorrect residency information.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I am tired of telling the House that rushed legislation is bad legislation.  Once again we are at the mercy of the Government's inefficiency and pressurised to copperfasten its expedient legislation.  Local authorities are the bedrock of local democracy.  As a former general secretary of the Local Authority Members Association, I know well the issues of concern to all local authorities.  The whims of central Government cannot be allowed to impact adversely on the autonomy of local authorities.  I will not support this Bill and will vote against it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_518">When I noticed the Local Government (Roads Functions) Bill on this week's schedule, I was looking forward to learning of major proposals for the future of the road network.  However, when I read the technical aspects of the Bill, I was disappointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">What is the future of the local improvement and the community involvement scheme?  While these important schemes have had a large impact on many communities, their single largest problem is in securing adequate funding.  When I served on south Tipperary's local authority, each year when agreeing the council's budget, our main concern was the lack of funding for roads projects.  We were forced to wait each year for the Minister to announce how much would be available.  The powers-that-be in any Department in Dublin do not understand the impact of the local improvement scheme on rural communities.  With the forthcoming budget, will the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government make more funding available for these wonderful schemes?</p>
          <p eId="para_520">As a Member I am always frustrated with replies to parliamentary questions from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  As a Member representing a rural constituency, I note that every week a matter is raised about the condition of local roads.  As traffic volumes increase, it is becoming an important issue.  I do not understand why a simple reply to parliamentary questions on road projects and improvements cannot be had.  How the Department of Social and Family Affairs deals with parliamentary questions is an example to behold and which every other Department must follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I question the wisdom and logic of transferring certain powers from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Department of Transport as proposed in the Bill.  I am concerned this will not be good for road users.  People are frustrated because they are paying a large amount in road tax.  Those living in rural Ireland see a large amount of tax being paid in keeping a car on the road, from when one buys a vehicle to motor tax to the petrol pump.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Recently there was debate on putting extra taxes on jeeps and SUVs because they are supposed to be fuel-guzzlers.  The Minister, Deputy John Gormley, promotes this view.  He should be very careful as many of these vehicles are necessary to those who are hard-pressed in rural Ireland.  Before the Minister jumps to make such a decision he should tread carefully and think of the people on low incomes whose way of life has changed drastically but who need those vehicles.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Deputy Martin Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_523">Not for the first time I have the pleasure of following my constituency colleague, Deputy Tom Hayes, and while I do not agree with everything he said I agree with much of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">This is primarily a Bill about the organisation of Government business.  There is no perfect rational way of organising sections of Departments, however they are divided there will be anomalies.  In 2002 a rationale was put forward for allocating national roads to the Department of Transport and other roads to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and LocalGovernment because local authorities have much to do with local and regional roads.  They are also involved in the national roads programme, if not to the same extent as the National Roads Authority.  I accept and support the idea that one Minister be responsible for all roads because some important roads, not classified as national roads might otherwise be the responsibility of a separate Minister.  Departments are shaped and reshaped partly to reflect the wishes and attributes of Ministers.  I am not entirely surprised to find that the Minister of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is also the leader of the Green Party, is divesting himself of responsibility for roads.  At best roads have a neutral, and at worst a negative, connotation for someone with an environmental, ecological outlook.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Those who live in Dublin or who, like all of us here, spend a great deal of time speeding a considerable distance down national roads, may not appreciate that people in rural constituencies primarily use local and regional roads and maybe some bit of national road close to their homes.  For most of their working lives they may never go near a dual carriageway or a motorway.  If one conducted a survey of the numbers using the different roads one would find that 85% of traffic, or more, is on non-national roads.  These roads are important but of variable quality, some are good, while others connecting important towns leave much to be desired.  The same applies to small roads, some of which are dangerous and twisting with ditches that are falling in.  An announcement on the local improvements scheme is imminent and it will contain good news for west and south-west Tipperary to which I look forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">At a meeting that I attended last night someone made the point about speed limits that there is an 80 km/h limit on good regional roads and on every other sort of local and rural road even those of poor quality.  One may take the view that the Government or public authority should not have to legislate for everything or one can impute common sense to people.  I had to travel up the mountains today, to pay my respects to a former councillor who lost her husband yesterday, and realise that 60 km/h is fast on some of those roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Too little attention is paid to the road drainage these days compared with a generation ago.  Farmers do not seem to maintain their drains as they used to do, when perhaps they had more time.  There may have been more personnel in local authorities who were more attentive to this work.  When a rainy season begins, which may be fairly soon after the two and a half months of dry weather we have been experiencing, flooding and potholes occur rapidly.  The Government and local authorities should pay more attention to improving drainage, possibly by including it in farm schemes, which would benefit farmers and their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Given the volume of fast traffic nowadays there is a case to be made for extending pavements some way out of towns and villages.  The only surprise is that there are not more accidents involving pedestrians.  Street lighting helps where there is a cluster of houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">According to the newspapers the construction industry faces a steep decline in house building.  I hope that the budget and the Estimates will provide substantial funding for the national roads programme and for local and regional roads.  While we all understand the importance of the national roads to the national economy and for important centres, hubs and gateways and so on we must not lose sight of the fact that local roads, all the way down to the boreen, are important to the people who live near them.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I wish that road signs were improved.  Some counties place an L sign at the end of every road, however small or minor.  I discovered when a road scheme was mooted for the Tipperary bypass and part of it crossed a road close to my home that the minor road I use is a four-digit L route.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">It would be helpful if this was extended to help people identify where they are going when they leave an area.  Road signs could be improved and some important towns are separated by hills.  The road signs between Nenagh and Tipperary are appalling and the opportunities for strangers and visitors to lose their way are infinite.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The previous speaker made a point on road tax which, like most taxes, is not a dedicated tax.  On the whole, dedicated taxes are not an efficient way to run a budget; those who use our roads not only contribute to the upkeep of roads and investment in transport but also help fund our schools and hospitals.  As a driver who pays his fair share of road tax, and every other tax on petrol, diesel and so, on I do not object to this.  The Exchequer needs money to pay for public services and, on the whole, those who use roads are not the worst off in society — especially not those who drive large jeeps and four by fours.  Deputy Hayes made a touching case for people in expensive jeeps who are deprived and for whom these vehicles are essential but I do not accept this.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">We must get a little serious on carbon emissions and sometimes a little discouragement can work wonders.  Take the plastic bag tax, for example.  Will anyone, even a person on social welfare, be bankrupted by paying 20c for a plastic bag?  Of course not, but the impact is psychological.  We all waste far more than 20c on a variety of things but the psychology in this case works.  A little fiscal discouragement of gas guzzlers and a lot of discouragement of the kinds of vehicles that race at high speed around our streets and country roads at night, performing figures of eight and doughnuts, and better enforcement of speeding laws would do us all a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I broadly welcome this Bill and believe it gives this House an opportunity to focus on the importance of local roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Regarding the issue of safety, our school buses travel on some quite poor roads that may be quite hazardous.  A survey this morning suggests our children have more freedom in some ways but I feel they have less freedom in other ways.  Not many parents would be happy to see their children under ten years of age go on 30 mile bicycle rides around the countryside, the way they once could, when the only hazard might be a dog that could bite one's ankle.  The emphasis in the survey was on security and this issue is evident in parents' concerns about the safety of their children.  They have every right to be concerned, not least regarding road safety.  In the past 24 hours a lorry drove up on a pavement and I was nearly knocked down by a car speeding into a parking position on a pavement.  We must examine the safety dimension.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">We justified a rail safety programme that took in less used railways and perhaps it is time for a road safety programme that sees investment in road infrastructure in addition to the measures for which the Road Safety Authority, under Gay Byrne, is responsible.  We must remember that speed limits, alcohol testing, driving tests and so on represent only one side of the equation.  Accidents happen more frequently at certain locations and this is likely to be for physical reasons.  Attention must be paid to the improvement and maintenance of hazardous sections of road, even if it requires the straightening of bends or ensuring that hedges are properly cut and that the sides of roads do not slope too precipitously.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">A great deal of work needs to be done in this area.  I welcome the Minister to the House and stress to him that roads that are not national roads are also very important.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_282">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_538">I wish to share time with Deputies Clune and Crawford.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I welcome the Minister to the House and concur with my colleagues on this side of the House in their scepticism.  We are handing part of a Department to the Department of Transport, run by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and this does not instil confidence regarding competence and future direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">An array of experiences in the recent past also informs my personal scepticism.  The Department of Transport has formulated great plans on paper, but, similar to Chelsea Football Club, on the field it is a different story and we need only look to Transport 21 for evidence of this.  Even when Deputy Martin Cullen was Minister for Transport and I was a Member of the Seanad I asked parliamentary questions through my colleague, Deputy Dinny McGinley, regarding consultations with our colleagues across the Border seeking to bring about joined up thinking and joint strategies.  This drew a blank because the harsh reality is Transport 21 is built on foundations of sand and does not go into the long-term strategic thinking needed for our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">There are regular announcements made regarding non-regional roads in the Border areas.  Prior to the recent general election the Taoiseach flew to Letterkenny in a helicopter to announce that there will be a motorway from Dublin to Derry.  That was a beautiful announcement when his party faced losing two of three seats in Donegal north-east and unfortunately it worked because Fianna Fáil held on to two of those seats.  Fortunately I squeezed in.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_543">I struggled through and this incident exemplifies the approach to joined up thinking.  We are discussing non-regional roads but sharp focus is necessary when considering towns and villages such as St. Johnston, Muff and Carrigans.  These rural areas suffered considerably, both economically and socially, during the 30 years of the Troubles.  These are the forgotten areas that have not featured in mainstream thinking in regard to infrastructural development.  We politicians tend to focus on the grandiose announcements regarding motorways and dual carriageways.  I hope the Minister will look after these Border roads within the new framework.  Their condition is an absolute disgrace.  The EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and its successor, PEACE II, have filled a vacuum in funding in the past ten years.  In terms of long-term strategic thinking, however, we cannot expect local authorities to meet the maintenance costs involved.  We must adopt a strategic approach to developing these routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Consideration must be given to the provision of railway services in the region.  Donegal County Council presented a document to the strategic committee in recent days putting forward the case for opening up a former railway route to St. Johnston from Letterkenny and though Strabane.  I am disappointed that the Minister is being sidetracked from transport issues.  He is generally subjected to a barrage of criticism, but I had faith in him in this regard.  It was galling to hear a spokesperson for Iarnród Éireann saying on RTE Radio 1, with reference to the Sligo-Dublin route, that the number of rail passengers is continually increasing.  This is something we must tap into in terms of long-term strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Other types of infrastructural projects also require funding.  I put a question to the Minister for Transport as to whether there will be a funding mechanism for the continuance of the ferry route from Magilligan to Greencastle in north Inishowen.  The response was that the Department has no responsibility in this regard.  This points once again to the lack of joined up thinking in respect of public service provision.  The north west is a peripheral area and the lack of railway infrastructure means we must rely entirely on the transportation of goods by road.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">There is much talk of centralised decision-making, and we must look at that as an opportunity.  The National Roads Authority receives funding for the improvement and maintenance of national primary and secondary roads.  However, there has been an absolute deficit in terms of broader vision.  The NRA must give up the notion that a particular road project is a stand-alone one simply because it happens to be a national primary or secondary road.  Linkages can be created.  Some of the finest regional roads can be as good as, if not better than, some national secondary roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I call for a broadening of thinking in terms of the strategic linkage between our national primary and secondary routes, on the one hand, and our non-national and regional roads, on the other.  I am sceptical about the purpose of this legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_548">As a member of the roads committee of Cork City Council since 1999, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Bill transfers an important element of the Minister's remit to the Department of Transport.  Many speakers have expressed their scepticism about this initiative in view of the difficulty we encounter in obtaining information from the NRA.  As Deputy McHugh observed, the national roads for which the NRA is responsible have a serious impact locally.  Many people use the local sections on a daily basis in travelling to and from work or school.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The condition of roads has been high on the agenda of my local authority since I became a councillor in 1999.  There are many kilometres of roads throughout the State in an unsatisfactory condition.  Many of the previous speakers represent more rural areas than my own.  The area I represent straddles parts of both Cork city and county, and I have seen a vast difference between the condition of the roads in both areas.  Money has been invested in developing roads in the city, an investment that was long overdue.  However, areas on the periphery of the city, including Grange, Rochestown and Togher, do not enjoy the funding to which they are entitled.  I hope the Minister will review the request for a boundary extension to Cork city's local authority area.</p>

          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_551">The Minister should ask people in the area how they might be better served.  Cork city has a low population and, in selling itself abroad, needs to improve its population base.  It is a discussion for another day and a debate that is ongoing in the area.  In terms of roads and services, people would be better served in coming under the remit of Cork City Council.  Cork County Council is responsible for an area stretching from Allihies to the border with Waterford.  In such a vast region, the areas on the periphery of the city suffer.  It is probably the same in Limerick and Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The status of the quay walls in Cork city has varied from national to non-national.  Meanwhile, the walls are crumbling into the river.  As a result, the marina, which is a wonderful amenity, is subsiding.  The quay walls have featured on Cork City Council's roads programme for as long as I have been there but the funding is never available.  Nobody wants to spend up to €15 million on a project that will not improve the appearance and condition of roads in the area.  The walls have historical and heritage value for the city but will be expensive to repair.  Nobody is taking responsibility and the funding programme continues to be put forward every year.  We received funding for a consultant's report and that report was produced, but no funding is forthcoming to undertake the necessary work.  Perhaps this project should be extracted from the city council's roads programme and included elsewhere.  I do not know whether it is any longer a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or if it should be deferred to the Department of Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The area I represent includes several large housing estates, some of which are in poor condition.  There is a huge demand for traffic calming measures.  Speed ramps are evident in many suburban areas in Dublin, some of them attractive and others not.  Local authorities can introduce a speed limit of 30 km/h in a designated area, but this must be done in conjunction with some form of traffic calming.  As someone who is active locally, this has emerged as the most important issue for residents in recent years.  As we have progressed with resurfacing footpaths and improving public lighting, speeding motorists has become of primary concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I am sure the provision of facilities for pedestrians is something close to the Minister's heart.  In most housing estates and other large suburban settlements, pedestrians, both old and young, do not have priority, even though it is their own neighbourhood.  The car is king.  We need to step back from that and recognise that people are living in these areas who wish to walk, cycle and push buggies.  Elderly people want to feel comfortable in the area.  We do not have enough pedestrian crossings and footpaths in many areas are not wide enough.  Speed limits are also unsuitable.  On the whole, there is not enough emphasis on safety for pedestrians and giving them priority, which I would like to see make a return.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">We have seen some green routes coming through the city and county area.  They accommodate buses but also provide safety for pedestrians and encourage people to cycle or walk.  We have seen they are very effective.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_559">That Dáil Éireann,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_560">calls on the Government to radically modify the new proposed child care subvention scheme that the Government intends to become fully operational from 1 July 2008, as this scheme:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_561">will impose intolerable financial pressures on many parents by increasing the expense of child care;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_562">will force some parents to leave employment and become dependent on social welfare payments;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_563">threatens to cause the closure of many not-for-profit crèches throughout the country;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_564">presently renders it impossible for such crèches to recruit new staff on a permanent basis; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_565">undermines the prospects of returning to the workforce or the obtaining of essential training and education by parents presently working in the home who wish to resume employment;</p>
          <p eId="para_566">and further calls on the Government to extend application of the existing subvention scheme up to 31 December 2008 to end the current uncertainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">I wish to share time with Deputies Carey, Feighan, D'Arcy, Clune, O'Mahony, McHugh and McCormack.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman will indicate when I approach 14 minutes in my contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The Government has displayed stunning incompetence in announcing the new community child care subvention scheme that is to become fully operational on 1 July 2008.  I acknowledge the new scheme will benefit a small percentage of community child care services, particularly in some disadvantaged areas of Dublin where a substantial portion of parents are recipients of social welfare or family income supplement.  However, it will also have a profoundly detrimental impact on parents, children and the vast majority of community child care services established on a not-for-profit basis throughout the country.  For children, many parents and community child care providers, implementation of the new scheme is potentially catastrophic in that it will make it financially unviable for parents to continue to use crèche facilities, and it will force some to make a choice between continuing at work or having children.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The question must be asked if the Government is attempting to implement a surreptitious "one child per family" policy such as currently exists in China.  The new child care subvention scheme could be described as State-imposed family planning by stealth.  Clearly, its impact is anti-family, anti-child and anti-parent.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">As an instrument of economic policy it is entirely misconceived.  The continued economic success of this country and our capacity for continuing growth remains partially dependent on the net immigration of workers into this country.  As we have a growing elderly and greying population, and as the imbalance widens between those in employment and those retired, it is also dependent on our birth rate naturally growing.  It should be an essential social and economic objective in this State, as in other member states of the European Union, that parents be encouraged to have children rather than discouraged, and that the economic impact of rearing a young family be mitigated or relieved, not made unnecessarily burdensome.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The impact of the Minister's proposals were very starkly portrayed in a letter written to <i>The Irish Times</i> by Oonagh Montague.  I wish to quote some extracts from that letter.  She states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_572">Today the Government made the decision for me that I shall only have one child.  Up until now I had been trying to hold my ground against the grinding increases in all of life's necessities.  Finally, my husband and I must admit defeat.  The Government has introduced the Community Child Care Subvention Scheme.  This will affect the crèche our daughter attends.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">She goes on:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_574">Whatever remains after child care is needed to pay bills.  We do not go on sun holidays.  Our car was born in 1995.  We do not go out to dinner and the cinema is a rare treat.  Like many of my friends, we live a rather frugal life.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">She continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_576">Up to now I thought I could muddle along.  Now things have changed.  This morning it seems the Government has won.  This is one final increase we cannot overcome. So I can only have one child.  I thought this was a decision I would make for myself.  I will not attempt to express how this makes me feel.  Sometimes there are not words to convey how hopeless this country's voters feel.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">That letter very eloquently and starkly portrays the concerns of many parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The current scheme originally operated under the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-06 and was co-funded by the European Union Social Fund.  Through it, targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community-based not-for-profit child-care providers were awarded grant aid towards staffing costs to allow them to charge parents limited fees for child care.  This scheme, which originally was to end in 2006, was continued by the Government to the end of 2007, no doubt because 2007 was an election year.  No detailed description of the newly-announced scheme was contained in any of the election manifestos of the Government parties.  It was simply cynically announced a short few weeks after the formation of the present Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Funding under the present scheme provides universal supports for all parents who avail of not-for-profit child care services but the new scheme applies to a limited category of parents.  In practice, only parents in receipt of social welfare payments or participating in community employment will benefit from an €80 weekly subvention in respect of full day care provision, and parents in receipt of family income supplement will benefit from a €30 weekly subvention in respect of such day care.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Many parents currently in employment and in receipt of modest earnings will be required to pay substantially higher weekly child care costs than those now incurred.  This is because implementation of the new scheme will render it impossible for current services to continue without increasing charges to parents who do not benefit from subventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The announced new scheme has caused genuine alarm and stress to parents and has resulted in many genuine concerns being voiced by those involved in the provision of community child care services.  These include Planet — The Partnerships Network, which is the representative voice of the 38 area-based partnerships, which work to promote social inclusion through the development of disadvantaged areas and communities.  Such concerns have also been expressed by the Southside Childcare Action Network, Bawnogue Women's Development Group, St. Ronan's playgroup in Clondalkin, Catkin's nursery in Longford and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">It is clear the scheme, if unchanged, will have the following detrimental impacts.  It will impose intolerable financial pressure on many parents by dramatically increasing the expense of child care and it will force some parents to leave employment and become dependent on social welfare payments.  It will undermine the prospects of returning to the workforce or the obtaining of essential training and education by parents currently working in the home who wish to resume employment.  It places at risk the financial viability of many not-for-profit crèches throughout the country should it result in a reduction in the number of children availing of their services due to parents' inability to pay increased costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">It will act as a direct disincentive to parents currently dependent on welfare obtaining further education and training so as to rejoin the workforce, knowing that if they do so, any financial benefit gained through employment will be entirely or largely offset by increased child care crèche costs.  In some areas it will place at risk the social mix of children using specific crèches and will result in the overwhelming majority of children in such crèches deriving from parents dependent on social welfare and effectively segregate these children from others whose parents are in employment and who cease availing of crèche facilities, making arrangements for their children to be looked after by family members or friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The announced new scheme has already had a detrimental impact in so far as it has rendered it impossible for crèches to recruit new staff on a permanent basis in circumstances in which their future funding and capacity to pay wages of any staff recruited is entirely uncertain.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The new scheme as announced in theory becomes operative on 1 January 2008 but it will not apply to community child care facilities already funded under the current scheme until 1 July 2008.  Over 800 services throughout the country are currently in receipt of staffing grant support under the current scheme and transitional arrangements have been put in place to maintain the current scheme for all existing grant recipients until 1 July next.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">From statements made by both the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State with responsibility for children, it seems the reason for this transitional period is that the Minister for Health and Children announced the new scheme without having available to her essential information as to how it would work in practice, and without her Department first undertaking the necessary research to make appropriate judgments.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">No clear data was obtained or maintained as to what was the actual level of disadvantage in respect of parents and children benefiting from the current scheme, which has been in place for four years.  No research was undertaken to ascertain the profile of disadvantaged parents using the service or to determine the numbers removed from social welfare dependency to employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Although it was a condition of funding under the original scheme that a tiered fee structure apply to enable a broad range of parents and their children benefit based on their ability to pay and to ensure a good social mix, no adequate structures were put in place to ensure implementation of such a tiered system.  Neither was any advance research undertaken to determine the impact of any proposed changes to the existing scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Prior to announcing the new scheme, information should have been obtained from the service providers by the Minister to establish a profile of each service currently available in terms of the type of services provided, the profile of the parents using the service for their children, the operational costs and any other relevant data indicating a special need that requires a particular approach.  Instead of first obtaining the information and then announcing a new scheme, the Government announced the scheme and is now seeking the information.  Not only is this an extraordinarily incompetent way in which to administer public funds, because it confirms there was no proper monitoring of expenditure on the current scheme, it is also a scandalously inept approach to the formulation of crucial social policy affecting the rights and day to day lives of parents and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The reality is that in today's world for most parents to keep their heads financially above water, it is essential that both mothers and fathers are in employment.  The truth is that we need more, not less affordable quality child care services; we must reduce the costs for all parents who need to avail of crèche and other child care facilities; we must apply the child-centred approach promised in the Government's National Development Plan 2007-2013; and we must implement policies which strongly support parents into and in employment.  We should encourage a work ethic and not force parents to become welfare dependent.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The new scheme announced by the Government fails to reflect any of these principles.  We have been told in this House that when the Government completes the research that is now under way, it will consider what amendments, if any, it can make to the newly announced child care subvention scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The Minister has indicated that by February or March next, he hopes to be in a position to bring proposals to Government.  We do not know if he will have funding for the new proposals, the content of the proposals, how they will affect parents and children or the capacity of the current crèche providers to maintain their services.  The Minister at this stage does not know what he will propose as the Department must now consider and analyse detailed information received from over 800 service providers about tens of thousands of parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">It is not good enough that the current uncertainty should continue.  The new and amended scheme the Minister is considering announcing should be first published in draft form with a report detailing the information obtained from the research undertaken and the conclusions derived from it.  There should be total transparency and, following publication, there should be a three month consultation period, following which the scheme the Minister proposes to adopt should be brought before this House for debate and, if need be, amendment.  In the interim, the Minister should end the current uncertainty and announce that the current scheme, which is to continue on a transitional basis until 1 July next, will be extended until 31 December 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I call on all parties in this House to support the Fine Gael motion and demand that the Minister address the current uncertainty and real concerns of parents and service providers who have contributed outstanding service to local communities in establishing not-for-profit facilities for children and who wish to ensure secure employment for their staff until at least the end of 2008 and to know where they stand.  It is intolerable that the present situation should continue.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_595">I strongly support this Fine Gael Private Members' motion.  It has been obvious for some time that one of the most pressing needs of today's society is to support parents as they bring up young families and attempt to balance home and work commitments.  The State must ensure that the hardships currently experienced by many families across the country are eased and a genuine choice is offered to parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Child care costs continue to soar — they have increased by 23% in the past two years.  As the cost of living increases, many families with two working parents are locked into a vicious pattern of trying to make ends meet.  It  is time for the Government to listen to these families and to put them first.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Deep concern has been expressed about the new proposed child care subvention scheme by parents and child care providers throughout the country.  Parents are rightly worried about the increase in child care costs and not-for profit crèche providers are facing the real prospect of closure . Newly built community crèches, which promised a better future, now face the real prospect of lying idle.  With this, parents in receipt of social welfare payments will have little incentive to return to work or resume education or training if the scheme goes ahead as planned.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The calls for the scheme to be altered are loud, clear and comprehensive.  In my constituency, I wish to highlight in-depth research carried out by the Clare community-based not-for-profit child care providers.  Their findings, which represent the views of 18 community child care providers in County Clare, confirmed that if the scheme goes ahead as announced the quality and standard of existing services will suffer and child care places will be lost.  The narrow definition of "disadvantaged" as set out by the proposed scheme will have the effect of creating a new poverty trap for those who wish to take advantage of new work opportunities, pay rises, seasonal work or education and training where welfare payments are not retained.  The lack of consultation with those working within the sector on a day-to-day basis, even by the Government's standards, is a mark of appalling arrogance on the part of an increasingly out of touch Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I will highlight two projects in County Clare which will be adversely affected.  The first project is based in an urban setting and has 78 children.  Parents of 59 of these children, or two thirds of them, are in receipt of social welfare payments.  The total operating cost is €420,000, with expected fees of €280,000 and a staffing grant of €130,000, thereby leaving a €10,000 shortfall.  Based on the current enrolment, the subvention allocated will be €75,000, which will lead to an annual loss of €65.000.  To offset this loss, fees will have to rise by almost one third in most cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The second project is located in a rural area with no similar service for 20 miles.  The centre caters for 83 children, who are charged €100 per week for day care and €40 for play-school.  Based on the current proposals these fees will have to rise to €180 and €72 respectively, equivalent to an 80% increase.  In practical terms these proposals will render this service unsustainable, resulting in a reduction in opening hours or a greatly reduced service.  In such rural areas the consequences will be devastating.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I wholeheartedly support this Fine Gael Private Members' motion.  I appeal to the Minister to listen to our argument.  It is clearly not acceptable that parents on low incomes are expected to wait for four months for clarity on this issue.  Parents and community child care providers, such as the one in County Clare, must not be left in the dark.  The scheme must be amended. It is time for the Government to get back in touch with the needs of families.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
          <p eId="para_602">Did the Minister of State have an input into the proposals put forward by his Department?  As a rural TD, he must understand the repercussions of his proposals.  Crèches in rural areas are not as efficient as those in urban areas.  In rural areas, occupancy of 65% is common so it is impossible to work as cost effectively as in a crèche in an urban area.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">In many cases both spouses are working, the mother is unable to find work three or four miles away and invariably must travel 30 miles in a car, costing up to €120 per week, to get to work.  Who decides the percentage of income that makes child care affordable?  This has not been addressed in the value for money report.  Were the Minister of State's proposals to go ahead, such women would be obliged to leave the workplace and would no longer contribute towards their pensions.  Given that this policy is being promoted by the Government, the proposal has not been thought through.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">How will grants be calculated and distributed?  I understand that grants are being calculated by the number of children in the crèche.  My calculations suggest that grants are not being calculated on the basis of the age of the children in the crèche.  I refer to the cost to the Exchequer.  A total of 50% of a typical grant of €78,000 to a child care facility will return to the Government in PAYE and PRSI contributions.  Consequently, accurate and reflective data regarding the actual cost to the Government should be obtained.  I must also emphasise another point.  A new child care facility has been built in my locality at a cost of €1.25 million.  Were the Minister of State to proceed with his proposals, its doors would not open.  We will be left with white elephants throughout Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">This week I spoke to a lady who has two children under three years of age.  She gets them out of bed every morning at 6.15 a.m. to reach the child care facility by 7.15 a.m. to facilitate her arrival at work at 8 a.m.  She has a net income of €410 and her child care costs her €270.  She works 40 hours per week for a take home wage of €140 per week.  I ask the Minister of State and Members on the other side of the House to support this motion and to think of the mothers and their children nationwide.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelWDArcy" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
          <p eId="para_606">The Minister of State should listen to the points made by my colleagues.  The recent example cited by Deputy Sheahan reflects what is taking place nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">As the father of two young children and someone who relies on crèche facilities, I am acutely aware of the crippling child care costs imposed on parents in the State.  Such costs can be even more demanding on those who are disadvantaged.  The proposed new child care subvention scheme must be altered radically in order that neither children nor their parents in disadvantaged areas are neglected.  It is a scheme that was tabled cynically by the Government for commencement in the year after the general election because it knew the measure would not be welcomed.  It knew it would not be popular because it is aware it does not help some of those it is designed to help most.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">In this case, it may be appropriate to say, "suffer little children".  However, not only will children in disadvantaged areas suffer, so too will their parents and those who provide care for them in their home localities.  Effectively, the present EOCP programme was designed as a back to work scheme in order that those who aspired towards a better quality of life, job satisfaction and a sense of self-worth by contributing to the community and reinstating themselves into society, could so do without being completely crippled by those child care costs to which Deputy Sheahan referred.  Child care costs in Ireland are the highest in Europe and have risen by more than 22% in the last two years alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The current scheme, which was designed as a back to work measure, could be replaced by one that does the opposite.  Those people who gain from employment, which helps their quality of life, self-esteem and self-worth, may be obliged to return to a reliance on social welfare payments because the new scheme will not make working a viable option.  Those who are struggling at present may find that the scheme increases unbearably the financial pressures on them.  Those who wish to obtain essential training and education will find it to be increasingly difficult, if not impossible.  Members should be encouraging women to return to the workforce, to increase equality in the workforce and to create an increased sense of equality for the most disadvantaged, who most need it.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_610">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, to the House and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shatter, on tabling this motion.  This is a national issue and the Minister of State does not require Opposition Members to inform him of this.  The Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party had a robust debate on this issue and the Minister of State is aware that many of his colleagues are against the proposed new intervention and the new subvention scheme.  However, the sad reality is that the Minister of State's parliamentary colleagues will back him tomorrow night in voting down the Fine Gael motion, which has been welcomed nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">I attended a meeting in Letterkenny last night at which more than 200 service providers and parents were present.  As the Minister has been involved in this game for much longer than me, the last thing he needs is some advice from a novice like me.  However, as a rural Deputy or Minister of State, I advise him to take heed of developments.  If this proposal is implemented on 1 July, this issue will be brought onto the streets.  A campaign is being formed at present and the proposed changes are not going down well.  I advise the Minister of State to intervene at this early stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The wheel was not broken, in that a bottom-up approach was in place whereby parents got together on a voluntary basis to work with service providers.  Incidentally, those service providers worked on a voluntary basis at preschool for years as best they could under difficult circumstances.  The advent of this scheme meant they could be rewarded for their work and could receive a wage.  The devolved wage system that has been in use for the past six years worked and provided some credibility to the projects.  In tandem with increased capital funding, there have been significant improvements in the manner in which young people are treated at a preschool level.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">However, the Government proposals will take this away and will pull the carpet from under a working scheme.  The scheme allowed children to sit side by side, whose parents were in receipt of family income support or social welfare benefits or whose parents were working at different levels of the income stream.  We were getting rid of the stigmatisation of those who felt inadequate.  Children were ready to enter primary school, where the sons and daughters of parents who were working would sit side by side with the sons and daughters of those in receipt of family income support and social welfare benefits.  The Government's proposals will begin a process of segregation.  A beautiful integration project was in place that operated on a bottom-up basis, was community and family-led and used the best possible practice.  Young people with proper qualifications and training were involved and this scheme was working.  However, the Minister of State is pulling the rug from under it.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">Last September, as soon as I raised this issue, the Minister of State appeared on my local radio station one Friday evening to accuse me of being preposterous in my insinuation that the proposed scheme would not work.  He came out with some sort of nonsense to the effect that funding would be increased by 16%.  If this issue is considered at an economic level, there will be an increase in certain areas.  However, how will such an increase take effect if, as my colleague, Deputy Sheahan, has noted, there will be white elephants dotted across the country?  Such white elephants will lack both service providers and young people.  This matter should be taken seriously and the Minister of State should heed the contributions to the debate from this side of the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_615">I welcome this motion which "calls on the Government to radically modify the new proposed child care subvention scheme that the Government intends to become fully operational from 1 July 2008".  I do not take great pleasure in this issue.  For the last five years, Members have spent time attending the openings of crèches.  They have observed how, from the bottom up, parents, children and teachers who provided care, have worked together in many communities, a considerable number of which were rural, to ensure their area was not left behind in the provision of child care.  Many of the parents involved have gone to work and are delighted that the operation of this child care scheme over the past five years has provided them with the opportunity to enter the workplace.  It has generated great self-esteem among the parents and their children.  However, the proposed scheme may force parents to leave their employment and become dependent on social welfare schemes despite what we have been trying to achieve for many years.  I visited Dromahair last Friday night and met hundreds of people who were extremely angry about this new scheme.  That it targets disadvantage is to be welcomed.  However, it is affecting the new disadvantaged, those on middle incomes and those who need this scheme to get into the workplace, to get ahead and to ensure that their children have the best child care places before they start school.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">There is a saying "When you are in a hole, stop digging".  The Minister is listening to all the signals.  He knows about the public meetings being held around the country.  He can hear the ordinary people, who have no interest in politics but have an interest in the future provision of child care and in providing for their children, who are telling us that this scheme is against the best interests of their children.  We must listen to that.  It is all right for us when we are in opposition, but the Minister is in government and I know he hears his party's Deputies and Senators talking about this.  They are embarrassed by this scheme.  Deputy O'Rourke said two weeks ago that the Minister should not listen to his officials but should do what he thinks is right.  The officials in the Department are only considering the bottom line and do not care about what happens in rural Ireland.  I know the cupboards are bare and that a lot of things were promised in the election, but this time the Minister should listen to his backbenchers and the people at public meetings.  If he modifies the proposed child care subvention scheme I will not say it is a U-turn but will welcome the fact that the Government has at last seen sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The scheme affects people in rural areas who must travel to work.  We must address this.  This new scheme renders it impossible for crèches to recruit new staff on a permanent basis.  How can people get a mortgage or a car loan when there is a cloud hanging over child care provision?  I ask the Minister to sit down with the members of his parliamentary party and talk about this.  I ask him to do the right thing and reverse this disastrous proposal.  I will welcome it when he does so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_618">I discussed this matter with the Minister of State many times in the past month, including during Adjournment debates.  I am sure he is well aware that a series of public meetings have been taking place across the country.  There was one in Cork last week and there was also one in Donegal.  These meetings reflect the real concern that is out there regarding the proposed changes in the community child care scheme, particularly changes to staffing grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The community child care facilities have worked extremely well.  I represent a constituency which contains a number of RAPID areas and the community child care providers I talk to work in RAPID areas.  The child care facilities have proved to be extremely valuable.  They are certainly doing what they are supposed to do in that they give those who are welfare dependent the opportunity to move on by availing of education and joining the workforce.  The problem that has been highlighted is that of parents on low incomes who will be excluded from using these facilities and will therefore once again become welfare dependent.  Thus, the new scheme will reverse the progress that has been made by removing the supports that were previously available.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Generally, mothers are the people who depend on child care to get out to work.  People on low incomes who are working in supermarkets, department stores or the major shopping centres that have sprung up around our cities depend on community child care to allow them to go to work.  If a person is coming home with €200 per week and her child care costs are €100, that is 50% of her take-home pay.  If she is coming home with €400, that is 25% of her take-home pay.  The cost of child care in real terms is extremely high.  I do not have a problem with this as it is important that we have high quality staff and facilities.  We certainly cannot avoid those costs and we need to invest in child care.  However, we need to support people to allow them to enter the workforce and we need to support low-income workers.  If people were allowed to include their child care costs to qualify for family income support the door would be open to many more people to avail of community child care facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The Minister has extended the programme to July.  Listening to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Cullen, last week, I got the impression that there were to be changes to the scheme.  There is an expectation that some changes will be made so I recommend that the Minister come forward with these sooner rather than later to avoid uncertainty and anger and to put the scheme on a proper footing so that people can move forward in the knowledge that there is certainty and that these valuable community facilities will continue to be available.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_622">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute briefly to this debate on our community child care services and I commend Deputy Shatter and Fine Gael on bringing forward this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">There is deep concern among community child care providers across the country that the proposed new child care subvention scheme will only lead to greater disadvantage within our communities.  The new scheme would lead to massively increased fees which people on low incomes would find impossible to pay.  The result would be that many community child care providers would be forced to close.  In many cases, people on low incomes will be better off not working so that they have access to cheaper child care.  We should make no mistake about it, this new scheme is a disincentive for people to join the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">We are told that the changes being introduced are targeted at those who are disadvantaged, but the reality will be that these people will also be faced with a doubling of fees.  Meanwhile, the increase in fees will create a whole new disadvantaged section of the population who are unable to afford child care.  Staffing will be affected, jobs will be at risk and trained staff will be lost, which will in turn affect the quality of the service provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">There is genuine fear among all partners involved in the provision of child care at the moment.  In many cases, people from families in which two parents have entered the workforce are telling me that one of them will have to give up working outside the home.  Many representatives of community child care groups have asked me whether the purpose of this scheme is to close down the community child care system.  They also say that the changes are being proposed by people who have no understanding of how community models work.  We should remember that these services are being run in the community by voluntary committees of working mothers who have invested much time and energy in making the projects the success that they are.  In many cases staff attend meetings, training events and information sessions without any remittance from their employers.  In most cases employers cannot afford the cost so employees bear the cost of training and related expenses.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">If something is not broken, why fix it?  Instead of rewarding these voluntary groups with praise for a job well done and continuing the scheme, the proposed changes are pulling the rug from under the feet of the community.  Under the new scheme, the role of the community representatives will be more onerous because they will have to collect sensitive data from parents who, in many cases, are their neighbours.  This should not have to be done by volunteers.  Small rural child care providers in such areas of Mayo as Killeen, Clare Island, Bangor Erris, Bofeenan, Ballycroy, Robeen, Ballyglass, Ballinrobe and Kilmaine, to name but a few, who have explained their case to me, say that they will close if these changes go ahead.  If they close, it is not because they are inefficiently managed but rather because of these ill thought-out changes to the scheme.  I strongly support the Fine Gael motion.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Deputy Pádraic McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_627">I do not know whether the Minister is serious about the changes in the child care subvention scheme.  Up to now, child care facilities were co-funded under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, but this will change at the end of the year.  It is the responsibility of the Government to continue to fund this scheme in the manner in which it is currently being funded.  If the Minister states that there is a 16% increase in funding, could he please explain, when he arrives, where this money is going?  The reality on the ground does not reflect this.  At present, parents are paying €32 per week for four days or €40 for five days of child care.  Those same parents, if they are not on social welfare, will now pay €100 for a five-day week from July next.  Apart from the hardship this extra expense will cause parents, there are two other negatives.  First, as many of those community run child care facilities were set up to facilitate a parent, usually the mother, to get back in to the workforce, some of those may be on wages just above the threshold and will not be able to afford the increase in costs.  In many disadvantaged areas of Connemara and Galway city those community based facilities enable mothers to return to the workforce and this change in funding will have a negative effect on such parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The second real danger is that with the increased cost many parents will no longer be able to afford to send their children to these child care facilities with the result that the facilities will close, parents will lose the benefit of being able to go back to work and the children will be deprived of the learning experience available in the facilities.  I have personal experience of the benefit of such facilities in my constituency in Lettermullan, Lettermore, Clifden and Merview on the west side of Galway city.  Many of those community child care facilities are run on a non-profit basis.  My advice to the Minister of State is if it is not broken, do not fix it.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_630">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_631">"notes:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_632">the success of the Equal Opportunity Childcare Programme (EOCP) in establishing a childcare infrastructure in Ireland from a very low base, creating over 35,000 childcare places, which support not just parents in accessing employment, education and/or training, but also provide many young children with the benefit of early years education;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_633">the role within that programme of the staffing scheme, which over 8 years provided a total of €174 million in supports for the running costs of community based not-for-profit services in disadvantaged areas;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_634">that the staffing scheme was originally awarded to such groups for a limited period, in order to allow them become self-sustaining where this was possible;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_635">that following this period, a number of such groups in very disadvantaged areas were awarded staffing continuation funding to the end of the EOCP, to allow them continue to reduce the fees charged to disadvantaged parents.  A condition of this funding was the development of tiered fees, to ensure that the benefit of the grant aid went to the disadvantaged parents it was intended for.  This also ensured that community services did not unfairly compete with private services for middle and higher income parents;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_636">that a value for money review was conducted of the EOCP in 2006-07, which consulted with all stakeholders, including community childcare providers, private childcare providers, parents, and Government Departments.  While largely positive regarding the scheme, it called for the current method of funding to be replaced with a less <i>ad hoc</i> and more transparent system, which would more effectively target funding to disadvantaged groups.  The community childcare subvention scheme (CCSS) has been developed to provide this framework;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_637">that the staffing scheme will cost over €37 million in 2007, whereas €153 million has been secured for the CCSS over the 3 year period 2008-10 starting with €47 million in 2008; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_638">in addition to this targeted support for disadvantaged parents, universal support is available to all parents towards the cost of childcare through child benefit and the early childcare supplement, and the latter alone costs over €400 million in a full year;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_639">welcomes:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_640">that on the announcement of the new scheme in July 2007, it was also announced that the current level of funding to services would continue to July 2008, to allow the collection of data which would allow costing of improvements to the subventions under the scheme, and that a series of regional seminars were held where this was outlined to community childcare providers;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_641">that the large majority of groups have already returned this data, and the Office of the Minister for Children has started to collate and analyse it in order to advise the Government in regard to any changes or improvements which may be introduced, as promised last July;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_642">the initial analysis of this data suggests that, under the new scheme, even with no subvention, the price charged to non-disadvantaged parents will be significantly below the market price of childcare, largely as a result of capital grant aid and the not-for-profit nature of the services in question;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_643">a number of services, which already had a strong focus on disadvantage and had implemented the tiered fee structure, have contacted the Office of the Minister for Children to say that, having got the information required from parents, they will now have an increased level of grant aid from July 2008, regardless of any future improvements; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_644">the recent reiteration of the Office of the Minister for Children that this analysis will be completed early in 2008, and that enhancements based on the data will be presented to Government well in advance of next July;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_645">endorses:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_646">the Government's approach to supplementing universal supports to all parents such as child benefit and early childcare supplement, with additional supports to parents who would not otherwise be able to afford childcare and early years education for their children; and</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_650">The community child care subvention scheme is a new support scheme for community-based child care services which is being introduced under the national child care investment programme, NCIP, 2006-10 and which will come into effect in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I am concerned at some of the negative reporting in recent weeks regarding the scheme which is undoubtedly causing some unnecessary concern to child care providers in the community sector and to parents and staff associated with these services.  The Fine Gael motion, and the way it is being presented in some elements of the press, will contribute to this mis-reporting and the unnecessary concerns.  I am pleased to have this further opportunity to set the record straight in regard to the community child care subvention scheme, which has the sole purpose of continuing to support the community child care sector.  I am also pleased to have this opportunity to explain once again the deliberate and measured way, over a 12 month period, in which the new subvention scheme is being introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Since the announcement in July of this year of the Government's decision to introduce the new scheme in 2008, two of the most significant points which I continue to make have been consistently overlooked or ignored.  These are that the scheme has been designed to take effect following a 12 month transition phase, one of the key reasons for which was to enable an in-depth analysis of the scheme, as announced, to be undertaken.  The fact that I intend to report back with the outcome of this process to my colleagues in Government in early 2008, appears to be something of a surprise to the Deputies supporting the Private Members' motion.  That position has been outlined consistently since July last.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">As I said in the Seanad last week, there appears to be an impression that the Government will walk away from its €1.1 billion investment in child care from 2000 to 2010, over half of which has been spent to date.  There also appears to be an impression that the policy of putting community-based child care at the heart of our investment in child care will cease to be a fundamental principle of this investment despite the success of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06 and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-10, much of which has been built on the contribution and work of community volunteers, as has been mentioned by Deputy Shatter and others.  Nothing could be further from the truth and the new scheme is being introduced to continue this recognition and support for the community not-for-profit sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">As Deputies will be aware, the new subvention scheme will replace the EOCP staffing support scheme which ends next month.  The eight year EOCP, which has been co-funded by the Exchequer and EU Structural Funds, was the first major investment programme in child care in Ireland.  It adopted a particular focus on disadvantage and the community not-for-profit sector was able to apply for 100% capital grant funding, up to a ceiling of €1.4 million per project, to develop community based child care facilities.  Community child care services were also supported with current funding, under the staffing support grant scheme.  This scheme made funding towards the cost of child care staff available, recognising that, even where the full capital cost of these projects was met through grant funding, and despite being non-profit bodies, community child care groups which were located in disadvantaged areas and which had a strong focus on disadvantage, might not be in a position to become self-sustainable in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Specific funding was allocated under the scheme to assist community providers in their start-up years to target disadvantaged parents and their children using their services.  The grant was given on a three year basis as a support towards the services' staffing costs.  It took this form because supporting employment for child care workers qualified for grant aid under the EU rules governing the programme.  The original three year funding under this scheme began to end for some groups from 2004 onwards.  In most cases, where the community services receiving staffing grants were able to confirm their continuing focus on disadvantage, they were approved for continuation funding to bring them up to the end of the EOCP in December this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The ability of projects which receive developmental aid to become self-sustainable over time through funding support in their developmental stage, is an underlying principle of both the European Social Fund and the Exchequer.  The principle of self-sustainability was built into the EOCP from the outset and has been an explicit condition of grant approval since 2004 when the continuation funding commenced.  As a result, every existing EOCP staffing grant recipient has agreed to operate a tiered fee system which is tailored to the differing economic circumstances of their client group and which ensures that child care places subsidised by the programme are targeted towards those most in need.  In effect, the grant recipients were required to use their grant aid to give a high degree of subsidisation to very disadvantaged parents, a lesser degree of subsidisation to less disadvantaged parents, and no subsidisation, other than the general benefit of the capital grant aid, to non-disadvantaged parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The new community child care subvention scheme will continue to be based on the tiered fee system.  Under the new scheme, services will continue to receive grant aid on the basis that they charge fees to parents which relate directly to the level of subvention they receive in respect of particular parents.  I should say that many community child care groups implemented effective tiered fee systems and complied with this requirement under the EOCP, thereby enabling disadvantaged parents to access child care at reduced costs.  However, it is also the case that many services did not implement this requirement as envisaged under the programme and, for them, the new scheme will require them to review their current fee structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I can see that for community services which were not implementing an effective tiered fee system up to now, the new scheme may appear to be an intrusion into the way they operate their services.  The comment could be made that the more structured approach under the new scheme, to ensure that all services implement effective tiered fee structures, should have been introduced earlier.  It is a point that Deputy Shatter made earlier.  I would not support this view as I think it was important that the EOCP responded in a developmental way to fostering and supporting the community services and their invaluable work and contribution to local child care services.  However, as with any programme, in particular an innovative and developmental one such as the EOCP, in moving forward it is important to build on strengths and identify weaknesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">The value for money review of the EOCP made recommendations for a new community support scheme under the NCIP, which it identified as a transitional programme which should complete the development of new child care services while longer-term child care policy would be considered in the context of a third child care programme for 2011-15.  These recommendations emphasised the need for the NCIP community support scheme to be based on having effective tiered fee structures in place with appropriate minimum and maximum fees.  In addition, eligibility for funding should be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure all services move towards sustainability when this is possible and the new scheme should be less <i>ad hoc</i>, more structured and transparent, and better targeted on appropriate groups, including socially excluded groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">In considering those aspects of the staffing support scheme which could benefit from more structured and transparent systems and criteria, it is clear that a more consistent approach is required in determining the level of grant aid and the way it is used, than was the case under the EOCP.  In order to qualify for the staffing grant scheme, community child care groups were first required to show that they were located in a disadvantaged area, with CLÁR and RAPID as the two key indicators in this respect.  After that, the group was asked to demonstrate in its grant application that it would adopt a strong focus on disadvantage.  This was largely a self-reporting system with no clear data, particularly as time went by, on the level of disadvantage in the services.  Clearly, with the economic upturn and high employment rates now enjoyed in Ireland, the profile of disadvantaged parents using the services has, possibly, changed considerably and the increase in employment is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">As the profile of services in receipt of grant funding changed over time, different services responded in different ways.  Many services implemented effective tiered fee structures enabling the broad range of parents and their children to benefit based on their ability to pay and ensuring a good social mix.  Where services did not implement an effective tiered fee structure but charged reduced fees across the board, in some cases this resulted in very low fees for all parents, including non-disadvantaged parents, sometimes leading to an inability to compete on the part of other, non-subsidised private sector providers in the area.  Where services combined the grant aid with their increasing ability to collect more substantial fees and adopted a higher, across the board rate, this often resulted in a very high quality of service provision, but one that was outside the reach of the disadvantaged parents for whom the grant aid was intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Another weakness of the current scheme is its non-transparency and the fact that the broadly drawn criteria resulted in a high level of subjectivity in the assessment of grant applications.  There have been cases where applications from services with very similar levels of disadvantage and service provision were approved for substantially different levels of funding.  Again, the subjectivity of the criteria was not assisted by the degree of self-reporting on which the system relied.  In addition, the current scheme penalises large-scale services which have very disadvantaged profiles, as the level of grant funding is capped and disadvantaged parents using a community service which is not located in a disadvantaged area could not avail of the subsidised fees as the scheme is defined by reference to the area rather than the parent.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">All of these issues highlight the fact that in meeting the needs of the existing grant-aided community child care sector, as well as moving forward to any future child care programme of initiatives, we need to address a series of diverse and complex issues.  However, the fundamental principle which must guide us in meeting these needs, and at the same time further developing child care policy, is that we ensure that we find a fair and equitable approach to targeting disadvantaged parents using community child care facilities which is underpinned by transparency and accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">The new scheme has been portrayed widely as a cutback in funding for the community sector and for disadvantaged parents and their children.  Nothing could be further from the truth and the new scheme has been given a total funding allocation of €153 million over three years.  This means that in 2008, some €47 million will be available to the new scheme while €37.25 million was available under the EOCP staffing scheme in 2007.  This substantial increase in funding is intended to ensure that the greatest number of children and parents using community-based child care services benefit.  The truth is that, in the absence of sufficiently hard data to enable my office to accurately quantify and cost a more generous scheme under the new, more transparent arrangements, it was decided to identify the most disadvantaged categories of parents at the outset.  Clearly we could not disregard these parents and start at higher income levels but, equally, we could not commit to a scheme which goes beyond the most disadvantaged categories until we are in a position to accurately quantify and cost the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">This is the essential reason an innovative, transitional approach to the introduction of the scheme was adopted.  As more than 800 services are currently in receipt of staffing grant support, the first priority was to continue funding for these services during the transitional period.  All of the existing grant recipients who apply for funding under the new scheme will receive their existing level of funding during the first half of 2008.  To date, applications have been received from approximately 75% of the existing grant recipients and these are being processed as quickly as possible by my officials.  When the first priority of informing these services that they have been approved for funding under the new scheme has been completed, work will begin on the detailed analysis of the services in terms of the type of services they provide, the profile of the parents using the services for their children, the operational costs, and any other relevant data which might indicate that a special need exists which requires a particular approach to be adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">My officials and I have stressed at every opportunity that this data is essential to enable the assessment of the scheme, as announced, to be undertaken, and that the urgency with which this is being undertaken is to facilitate the existing services to move to the new scheme without disruption.  As I stated, the first priority is to inform the services that they have been approved for transitional funding.  After that, the analysis of the data will be completed and I will be considering the various issues which emerge so that I can meet my commitment to report back to the Government in early 2008.  Subject to the Government's decision and any changes agreed, my office will then be in contact with the services to advise them of their new funding level, based on the information provided with their application and the final details of the scheme.  I hope to see this process fully completed by the end of February or early March 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Clearly, I cannot be specific in advance of any Government decision as to what changes will take place.  However, I reiterate that the scheme will be implemented in a way which maximises the outcome for parents and their children using community child care facilities and that the funding which has been provided for this purpose has been greatly enhanced.</p>

        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_302">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_668">It is my pleasure to speak in support of the amendment.  It is important that we stand back to reflect on where we have come under the equal opportunities childcare programme.  A total of 35,000 extra child care places that did not exist in 2000 have been created with an investment of €500 million.  It is on that basis that we move on to the new programme outlined by the Minister of State.  The figures are quite staggering.  The sum of €575 million has been allocated with a target of creating 50,000 extra child care places.  Combined investment of approximately €100 million will lead to the creation of 80,000 child care places.  With that kind of investment on the part of the Government it was essential to have a value for money audit.  It is important in every way that the reporting would be tightened up so that everybody involved in managing the sector could be assured the investment was being targeted in the proper direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">It is important to reflect on the Minister of State's remark that the scheme is under review.  The review will be based on the returns that were due to be submitted last Friday week.  Those returns will show the exact level of disadvantage among the current clients of the community child care scheme.  Based on the information given in the returns, we will then be able to make a proper assessment and adjudication of the new scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">From my experience of the sector and from what I have heard from constituents in recent weeks, it appears the data from the forms will reveal flaws in the new system.  The jump from band B to band C, from families on family income supplement with a certain level of support, to virtually no support under band C, is too severe and restrictive.  I am confident when the data come back they will show a large numbers of families which are not eligible for FIS, but which will need support.  The national child care investment programme will require the benefit of a higher subsidy than is currently on offer in order to allow people to maintain their place and to keep working.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The data will show that in some areas and in some facilities the original aim of the programme has become skewed and that children are in facilities enjoying rates that were intended for families who are disadvantaged or on low incomes, whose parents are able to afford a higher rate.  The places they are currently occupying are at the expense of other children.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The new system presents a particular difficulty for child care facilities in rural areas.  I refer in particular to the minimum numbers required to access the grant and retain viability.  As a rural Deputy, the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, appreciates and understands this point.  It should be possible to provide an administration grant for rural facilities whose geographic catchment area is probably quite large but whose population centre is quite small, which are forced to look in many different directions in order to fill the places and maintain the viability of the centre.  This option should be examined for rural services whose viability could not otherwise be maintained.  The grant could be subject to conditions in regard to quality, service need in the area and the capacity to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">There is significant concern among organisations and committees involved in running child care facilities about data collection.  Even though the data required is quite basic, and is information that is freely available to many people, there is an understandable concern about information getting into the hands of the wrong people.  The data collection aspect of the scheme should be transferred to the county child care committees or even to the Office of the Minister for Children so as to take the local manager out of the data collection system altogether.  This approach would ensure we would still manage to acquire that information.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">It appears people have forgotten about the allocation of the child care supplement of €2,000.  In many centres this payment should be diverted to supplement the payment of child care.  The Government must reflect on this payment and redesign it in the context of the new scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The Fine Gael motion is premature.  It is only two weeks since the deadline for the submission of the data from all the centres around the country, which will no doubt provide proof for the various claims that have been made.  Given that much of that data will not get back to the Minister before next February, I suggest this motion is premature.  I am confident that when the data come back, the Minister will act in the interests of the community sector but, more importantly, in the interests of disadvantaged children and parents to ensure they continue to have access to the places in the community child care sector and that they can continue to work, should they wish, while using the facility.  I am confident that given the level of investment in the previous programme — €500 million is a great deal of money — the Minister will ensure white elephants are not created in some of the fantastic centres that have been established.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate on child care.  I commend the many magnificent crèches and child care groups that are doing excellent and valuable work.  If we are serious about tackling child poverty and educational disadvantage, the focus of the spending must go to the most disadvantaged children who would not have access to such services.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I welcome the provision of €37 million in 2007 and the €47 million for 2008, starting after Christmas.  These are major progressive developments and to say otherwise is misleading.  I especially welcome the extra funding that will go to the most disadvantaged children and families in Dublin North-Central.

          <p eId="para_679">On a wider level, I welcome the extra funding of €88,441 in information and communications technology grants for 18 schools in my constituency and the additional funding of €108,377 for Dublin North-Central schools.  I have also seen in recent weeks €1,165,485 being provided for a disabled housing project in Coolock, the setting up of the Greendale school for autistic children on the north side and extra educational services in the Marino area.  These are all clear strategies to improve our educational services for children and a direct attempt to build a future for our young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">An examination of the detailed figures in this debate will show that €153 million spent over the next three years is a massive investment in child care for the poorest sections of our society.  Investing in child care and education is an investment in the future.  It will create a better chance for our children and enable them to make choices that can sustain them for the rest of their lives and make them valuable members of our community.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">I came into politics through the community and voluntary sector and these are issues concerning my broader vision for this country.  Child care and quality education are the engine room of any future economy and will improve the quality of life for all our people.  I also welcome the fact that on the announcement of the new scheme in July 2007, it was also announced that the current level of funding to services would continue to July 2008 to allow the collection of data, which would allow costing of improvements to the subventions under the scheme, and that a series of regional seminars were held at which this was outlined to community child care providers.  The initial analysis of the data suggests that under the new scheme, even with no subvention, the price charged to non-disadvantaged parents will be significantly below the market price of child care largely as a result of capital grant aid and the not-for-profit nature of the services in question.  As well as this, a number of services which already had a strong focus on disadvantage and implemented the tiered fee structure have contacted the office of the Minister for children to say that having got the information required from parents, they will now have an increased level of grant aid from July 2008 regardless of any future improvements.  In other words, the most disadvantaged will gain more in this debate.  That should be our focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">We must build on improving child care services to ensure that all our children are cherished equally and every child in this State gets a good chance in a lifelong learning process.  It is only then that we can all say there is equality in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_683">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on child care and the success story that is child care support in this country.  The Government has directly promoted the development of preschool infrastructure virtually from scratch, so to speak.  We should be proud that since 2000, the European Union has supported the equal opportunities child care programme which means that many mothers have been in a position to go back into the workforce knowing there is a child care facility available to them to care for their children.  That programme has been a success and to date more than 35,000 new child care places have been created in the community, not-for-profit and private provider sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">A total of €500 million has been invested in that programme and we now move into the national child care investment programme.

          <p eId="para_687">The programme will be of support to people in disadvantage and I am keen that should be the case.  In some cases it has been suggested that people on low incomes will not be in a position to avail of this programme.  I disagree with that wholeheartedly.  This issue is a very different one.  What has happened in some cases is that well-salaried people are using community child care facilities.  They are availing of the same services at the same cost as those who are disadvantaged.  That is not appropriate in terms of fairness or an equal playing field.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Child care facilities are now set up throughout the country.  In my constituency we are very proud of an investment of more than €10 million in the child care programme in recent years, with wonderful facilities and more than 900 places in the county.  We are proud of the community services and the private providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">The one concern people have is the Civil Service getting involved in this programme to such an extent that a bureaucracy will be created.  That is something we do not want and the Minister must ensure that does not happen.  He should keep the support system for community child care simple to ensure those people are in a position to avail of the grants in the best interests of the people involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">The ordinary taxpayer is conscious of the enormous amount of money that will be invested in the coming years up to 2010.  They want to see that this money will go to the people who need it.  The debate has focused somewhat on people who are on social welfare.  That is unfortunate and it is a turnaround from what we had previously because the original programme, the equal opportunities child care programme, was aimed at getting people back to work.  The new programme should not be aimed at people on social welfare.  It must ensure those people who returned to work are in a position to stay there because they got the opportunity of having their children cared for.  It is important we identify with low income families and ensure they are part of the new regime of supports in the child care programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I am very pleased the Minister showed common sense by allowing the 12-month period when this programme was announced.  I have met and consulted many groups in my constituency and asked them to forward documentation to me — I will forward it to the Minister — outlining any difficulties they see in the operation of the programme.  Any pitfalls or difficulties that may arise will be identified between now and next May or June.  It is important that child care providers co-operate with the Department to tease out difficulties in the interest of child care provision until 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Statements concerning cutbacks in child care are inaccurate and should not have been made.</p>

The Opposition motion is political opportunism.  It should submit appropriate proposals to the Department instead of making a political issue of it.  People in many constituencies are making all kinds of statements and hyping something that will not be concluded until July 2008.  In the interests of a proper analysis of the child care programme, the way in which it is to be funded and who will receive grants, it is important to have a balanced and open debate with all of the available information, including that provided by child carers to the Minister and other public representatives.  We want one of Europe's best child care facilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_697">Listening to the debate has been interesting rather than enlightening.  The previous speaker was not lobbied as ferociously as the rest of us.  Not for the first time, light was originally cast on this issue in Cork.  Public representatives were asked to attend a public meeting last week by the Early Years Network, an umbrella group in Cork city and county.  The meeting made it obvious that the cutbacks in community child care would ensure that the people to whom the previous speaker referred would not be able to afford child care in their communities.</p>

          <p eId="para_700">The Acting Chairman is from Tallaght, so he is tolerant.  There is a difficulty regarding the amount of funding in the next tranche.  According to the Department's figures, funding of €500 million in the first tranche provided 30,000 places.  It is hoped the next tranche's funding of €575 million will provide 50,000 places, but the Government has not made the initial 30,000 places sustainable.  People are expected to sink or swim, which is what former Deputy, Michael McDowell, tried to do while he was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  He was stopped in his tracks by the outcry and furore the proposal engendered among the public, a head of steam that is rebuilding.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">According to the previous speaker, the Minister is so caring and good that he has allowed a year's lead-in and consultation, but that is not the case.  When the programme was first published, the time cited was January 2008.  The Minister extended that to next June because of the type of representation put in place last week in Cork.  I worry when something is extended to June and implemented in July.  As we know, the Government will be on holidays and assuming that others have done likewise, meaning we cannot address a matter until the following September or October.  The cutbacks will ensure that people on limited incomes who are not in receipt of social welfare payments, including the family income supplement, will not be able to afford child care in their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">As for the statement that we have a magnificent child care system, the 30,000 places are good because expertise and provision has been built up, but to say they will be sufficient to address demand is outrageous, ridiculous and untrue.  Events in Dublin and certain areas of Cork will recur, namely, the provision of child care will be ghettoised so that only the children of the poor will receive child care or early childhood intervention.  This is not what good child care is about.  It is not only about early educational needs, but also social interaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">The Government does not care about good quality child care.  It is only interested in stretching its money as far as possible.  If I worked in a crèche and knew that my provision for next June would mean a decrease from ten workers to four workers, I would not wait in hope until then were I to see another job on the horizon.  I would move on.  We will lose expertise and the people who provide excellent care.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Today's <i>Evening Echo</i> carries a story of a young mother.  The headline reads “I can’t afford to have more children”.  The Government forced people into the workplace because the economy demanded it.  This was not bad.  The Government does not care about children and will not provide the type of child care needed by the women in question.  Eventually, they will say that they can take no more and that they are going home.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_705">I rise as someone who does not need to depend on empirical or anecdotal evidence because I am the only Deputy present who is a director of a not-for-profit child care body.  I am also a member of the Westmeath County Childcare Committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">I am flabbergasted to hear the likes of Deputy Finian McGrath speaking in riddles and rhymes.  Are they behaving like ostriches and are their heads buried in the sand?  Why would Sr. Finbarr in Mullingar, who has worked with the disadvantaged and marginalised for many years and who is involved in child care, attend a public meeting and state that the scheme proposed by the Minister will be a disaster?  The Deputy spoke about someone who is at the coalface of child care provision to ensure lone parents get opportunities to return to the workforce.  The best route out of poverty is through a job.  Many lone parents, low income parents and parents on social welfare payments have found this to be the case.  It is a truism.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The way the scheme is structured will create a poverty trap.  The minute one tries to improve oneself, everything is lost.  No one should tell me about it because I work in this area.  I will give the House our scheme's evidence.  Our child care facility has ten workers and 50 children or so, many of whom have moved on over the years and are now putting their own children into the facility.  It is a high quality, accessible and affordable system.  It is not-for-profit and complies with the regulations and stipulations.  It has been visited by environmental health officers and public health nurses.  It must meet all the conditions and eligibility criteria.  The scheme under which we received the money under the equal opportunities child care programme will be €70,000 short after the changes proposed by the Minister.  As a director of a not-for-profit child care facility, a limited company, I will have an obligation to double the prices to ensure it is properly run and no reckless trading is involved.  That will be all right for a few people who are well off but what about those who are on social welfare?  Subvention will be fixed and they will have to find more money to pay for child care.  That is nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">I cannot believe this scheme was approved.  The only reason it is being reviewed is because its financing has moved from the European to the national Exchequer.  This scheme was overseen by the Department of Finance.  There was token consultation.  We were not consulted.  Many who use these crèches are the working poor who work hard from morning to night, leave their children in, pay substantial mortgages, pay for child care and transport to get to their jobs and are left with little on which to survive.  It is time the Minister woke up to this fact because he does not realise the damage that will be done.  Why would all the facilities in my area from Rathowen to Dromard in Longford to Kenagh, Kinnegad and Ballynacargy be up in arms?  Why is there a mass uprising?  The scheme must be reviewed.  It must be put on the back burner.  The Minister must ensure a proper scheme that allows affordable child care be put in place.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_317">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_709">The debate on child care we should be having is about how to ensure the best care for our children, including in the home, at school and in crèches.  We should debate how the State can support such a caring system and how it can be delivered to all who need it on the basis of need alone.  Instead, once again, we are addressing a critical situation, a botched Government scheme that has thrown the community child care system into chaos.  This need not have happened.  If the Department of Health and Children had consulted the community child care sector when it was framing a new scheme and if it had listened to what it was told by those on the front line of child care delivery, this situation would not have arisen.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The Government's approach has led first to confusion, then serious concern and now alarm among thousands of child care workers and parents.  The proposed new community child care subvention scheme is fundamentally flawed.  Throughout this State over recent weeks community child care workers and parents have been meeting to organise against the implementation of this scheme in its present form.  It requires radical and fundamental reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">In my constituency child care workers at Farney community crèche in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, have predicted that if this scheme goes ahead many parents will pull out of the crèche and it will have to double its fees.  Like other such child care facilities, it could be forced to close, resulting in loss of jobs.  Farney community crèche has provided affordable child care in Carrickmacross for more than a decade.  It has allowed many parents, especially women, to take up the opportunity for jobs and training.  This is under threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The Farney experience is replicated right across the Twenty-six Counties.  From Donegal to Wexford and from Dublin to Mayo, the community child care subvention scheme has provoked intense opposition.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith, is aware of this.  I met him recently in the company of other County Monaghan Oireachtas Members when he was lobbied by representatives of the community child care sector in our shared constituency.  Without exception those representatives made clear to the Minister of State their strong objections to the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">In response to the widespread alarm at the scheme the Minister of State has indicated that the subvention will not be confined to parents in receipt of social welfare.  This may be the beginning of a U-turn or it may not.  It has certainly caused further confusion.  The scheme has been clearly signalled to community child care workers as one designed for recipients of social welfare payments.  The application forms filled in by parents and collected by the crèches reflect this original design of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Last week my Dáil office received a briefing from officials in the Minister of State's office.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, for that opportunity.  However, the briefing confirmed that the scheme will go ahead as planned and that it is based primarily on subsidisation of child care costs for parents in receipt of social welfare.  In addition, the officials informed us that the application forms received will be assessed to ascertain the overall profile of parents using crèches subsidised under the equal opportunities child care programme.  We are told that based on the assessment, the Government will decide how widely to extend the subvention beyond those on social welfare.  The Minister's office indicates that a decision on a new income threshold will be announced in February.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The Government has felt the need to respond to the upsurge of opposition to this scheme but it is unclear what the outcome will be.  It is essential, therefore, to emphasise again the key points of objection to the scheme as it will remain essentially the same scheme and with the same negative consequences.  Nobody disagrees with the stated intent of the scheme which is to make child care more accessible for low income parents.  Too many families still cannot gain access to child care owing to lack of affordability.  This has serious consequences for children and for parents who wish to improve the lives of their families through part-time or full-time employment.  Far from meeting these needs in a fair manner, however, the new scheme, if implemented in its present form, could lead to a two-tier child care system.  We could have one tier of crèches for people on social welfare and other low income families and another tier for those paying the full cost.  The application procedure has already placed an excessive burden on often small community child care services that operate with few staff and feel overwhelmed by the bureaucracy that has landed on their desks.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">I emphasise again that there are already clear indications that this new scheme will lead to fees being increased significantly for those not on social welfare and it could also lead to crèches closing if they do not have sufficient numbers on social welfare on their books.  This scheme will undoubtedly drive many parents, especially women, back out of work and into social welfare dependence.  They will find that as they are not on social welfare they will not qualify for child care subvention and will face higher child care fees.  This will eat up their income and they will conclude that it is not worth their while working.  They will lose the opportunity to work and the community child care facilities will lose them as clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">We call on the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brendan Smith, to suspend the introduction of the new scheme, extending the EOCP in the meantime, pending full consultation with the community child care sector.  I emphasise that full consultation is crucial.  We need to get this right and not put in place a flawed system that could cause untold problems in the future and would be very difficult to unravel.  The Minister of State may well decide to extend the subvention, for example, to those with the full medical card.  The difference between the social welfare and the medical card thresholds would be marginal.  However the danger is that this would be presented as a major concession and extension of the scheme and that would not be the case.  I hope the Minister of State will note this fact because if that is the area in which he is considering extending the remit of the scheme it will fall significantly short of what he needs to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The scheme is fundamentally flawed.  We should move towards universal provision of preschool child care.  This scheme moves us in the opposite direction towards a two-tier structure that mirrors our grossly inequitable two-tier health service.  Sinn Féin has set out its vision of how the State should address this important issue of child care.  We believe the Government should have the following goals and should work to achieve them within a definite timeframe.</p>

            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_719">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.  The Mantua preschool child care facility in County Roscommon was established in September to carry out two functions.  It was to provide a service for young children and their parents in the local communities, while also securing the long-term future of Mantua national school, which was originally built in 1872 and is one of Ireland's oldest primary schools.   A few years ago the school was on a knife edge, as it was threatened with closure due to dwindling numbers.  The local community looked at the issue and thought of providing child care facilities locally.  The preschool would support those numbers at the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">There was a spare room at the school that was not being used, so the community established a child care committee and, subsequently, the preschool facility in Mantua national school.  The community raised funds for the projects, including over €2,000 at a function in the local pub.  They have also held car boot sales, an auction and a church gate collection.  They also submitted an application to Pobal for funding.  The school in question is recognised as disadvantaged by the Department of Education and Science under the DEIS scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">The number of young families moving into the Mantua area is growing, which augurs well for the future of the child care facility and the school itself.  The school applied for an interim staffing grant under the interim staffing measure of the NCIP, but it received a response from the Department that it had not demonstrated the ability to manage and sustain the service efficiently.  The service is up and running since 3 September, with five children on board.  A vacant classroom in an existing school is being used, and a modern child care service is being provided.  It is being managed by an experienced child care leader who is being paid from the funds that have been raised by the local community.  This small, rural community has raised over €2,000 to get this facility up and running.  The parents and the committee have told me that their funds are almost exhausted and they will have to close this Christmas unless the Minister rescinds the decision that was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">They also plan to expand the existing service to include an after-school service, but they cannot cater for that without the provision of funding from the Department.  The future of the school itself is in doubt if this funding is not provided.  There are several examples in my constituency of schools with small roll numbers, but they have managed to maintain and even increase numbers by putting child care facilities in vacant classrooms.  In this way, they have supported local education provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">In their response to the local community in Mantua, departmental officials stated that a new scheme would be coming into place from 1 January 2008 and that community representatives should contact the county child care committee to make an application.  The difficulty is that this facility will close at Christmas if the school does not get an interim funding grant from the Department to keep it going until it can apply under the new scheme.  We have been consistently told that the objective of the scheme is to support disadvantaged communities.  I ask the Minister of State to provide the interim funding to keep the facility going.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_724">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The programme for Government and the progress of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 and the national child care investment programme are confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing child care services to support the child care needs of parents.  The NCIP 2006-2010 has a funding allocation of €575 million and aims to create an additional 50,000 new child care places.  It is expected that approximately 22,000 of these places will be in the private sector and 28,000 in the community and not-for-profit sector.  Twenty per cent of the overall places will be for children in the three to four age group and will provide an early childhood care and education focus.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">The NCIP programme incorporates a number of key objectives.  It will increase the supply and quality of early childhood care and education services across the board.  It will also support families in breaking the cycle of disadvantage and will provide a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care that is centred on the needs of the child.  Both the EOCP and NCIP have a combined budget of almost €1.1 billion and are projected to create over 90,000 child care places, which are provided either through community-based and not-for-profit child care groups or by private providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">When taken into account with other child care related measures, such as the increases in paid and unpaid maternity leave, the introduction of the early childhood supplement worth €1,000 per year per child under six, and tax relief for child minders, no one can doubt that the Government is giving this issue the priority it deserves.  Many child care services throughout Roscommon have benefited from grant assistance under the EOCP and the NCIP.  To date, funding of over €10 million has been approved for child care in Roscommon, supporting the creation of 766 new child care places and supporting over 714 existing places throughout the county.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">The group in question applied for interim support funding under the NCIP and was declined in September 2007, as its application had not demonstrated sufficient ability to manage and sustain the service efficiently and, therefore, did not meet the requirements of the NCIP interim support scheme.  The group was invited to contact its local county child care committee, should it wish to apply for funding under the new community child care subvention scheme, which will come into effect in January 2008.  The group requested a review of this decision and its request, along with any details provided by the group, have been forwarded to Pobal, which oversees the day-to-day management of the programmes on behalf of my office, for an assessment which will be considered by the programme appraisal committee.  That committee will make its recommendation to the Secretary General who in turn will make the final decision, and the group will be informed of the decision.  It would be improper of me to prejudge the outcome of that process in advance of the final decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">The interim support scheme under the NCIP was introduced as an interim measure, pending the introduction of the new community child care subvention scheme, to facilitate groups which were unable to meet the contractual deadline of December 2006 for funding under the EOCP staffing support scheme.  Under the EOCP, targeted support was provided for community-based not-for-profit child care providers through the staffing support grant scheme.  The community child care subvention scheme under the NCIP is the successor programme to the EOCP staffing grant and will be introduced on 1 January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">This scheme has been allocated €153 million over the next three years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the parents who benefit.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.  It is hoped that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children, while continuing to support community child care services generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">The more detailed and comprehensive data which has been generated by the new scheme will be analysed by officials in my office between now and the end of December.  As outlined at the launch of the scheme last July and at regional seminars held by my officials since then, this data will allow any adjustments necessary to secure the best outcomes for child care services and for disadvantaged parents and their children, and will be considered by the Government in early 2008 and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.  I asked the review committee to analyse further the data submitted by the group and to make a decision as soon as possible on the application.</p>

            <p eId="para_733">In the past week a shattering and demoralising blow has been inflicted on the diligent and committed workforce at Premier Foods, Thurles, County Tipperary.  This company and the Erin brand, synonymous with Thurles, announced that it was to cease production, resulting in the loss of 95 jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">The workforce and their dependent families have endured prolonged uncertainty and fear of the unknown.  Arising from this decision, they face the prospect of coping with the daily pressures of life without a job and financial security.  We have an obligation and responsibility to provide alternative job opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">Will the Minister ensure the UK management of Premier Foods, the parent company of Erin, offers the current staff facing lay-off the maximum terms and conditions for redundancy?  Will he also ensure every support and resource is made available by the State to these 95 people to assist them in seeking new employment?</p>
            <p eId="para_736">I question the role of the Competition Authority in the demise of the Thurles Erin plant.  The authority's decision that Premier Foods had to divest from the Erin brand at the beginning of the year cast a long shadow over the future of the Thurles plant and its viability.  It is outrageous that the Competition Authority, operating autonomously, could make a decision which sounded the death knell of the Thurles plant.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">The plant's closure concludes the gradual obliteration of the manufacturing base in Thurles.  In the not too distant past, north Tipperary was home to some of the world's largest industrial companies such as Aventis Pharma, Antiger, Procter and Gamble, Tubex, BSN Medical and Irish-owned companies such as Irish Sugar.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">North Tipperary has not benefited from significant foreign direct investment for many years.  Throughout north Tipperary there are four international industries compared with 11 six years ago.  It is critical that a large scale positive action campaign is initiated to secure industry for the region.  To achieve this, it is vital that all parties concerned, from Government to development bodies and local business groups, embark on a cohesive, focused and coordinated course of action that will result in sustainable high quality industry locating in north Tipperary.  It is crucial that the full services of the investment promotion unit of Shannon Development, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are brought to bear in an attempt to attract the type of investment that Thurles and its hinterland deserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">The Government must address the urgent need to create and attract high-tech, high-end jobs to Thurles and north Tipperary.  To this end, it is imperative the Minster initiates a concerted and effective positive action campaign for the town and region.  North Tipperary and Thurles are ideal locations for new business enterprises.  Thurles is an excellent town which is well located and connected.  The town enjoys an educated, vibrant and skilled workforce.  It has many attributes that give it an advantage.  It is time these were harnessed to provide the industries that the town and its people require.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">The employment and job creation problems of north Tipperary are serious and require a specific coordinated response.  I call on the Minister to act quickly with the aim of implementing proactive and positive measures to encourage and attract foreign investment to north Tipperary.  It is imperative that sustainable, modern replacement industries be secured for Thurles as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_741">The company in question informed me last Thursday that redundancies would be taking place at its Thurles operation on a phased basis until June 2008.  I am concerned about the consequences for the workers involved and their families.  I wish to assure the people concerned that the Government, through the State development agencies, will provide every assistance it can.  The priorities will be the workers in the company and to increase employment opportunities for Thurles and north Tipperary.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">The role of FÁS, the State training agency, will be particularly important in offering assistance to the workers.  The agency made contact with the company today and the full range of its services will be made available to the employees if they wish to avail of them.  The company has decided to consolidate manufacturing in the parent company in the United Kingdom.  This decision follows an operational review of the Thurles factory.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">The development agencies will instigate a strong response.  The IDA Ireland strategy for Thurles and north Tipperary involves developing the knowledge economy by winning new foreign direct investment in innovation-driven, high skills sectors.  The agency is also working with its existing company base to expand their presence in Ireland by the addition of new functions of scale and by deepening their strategic functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">Another of the agency's strategies is to influence the provision of property solutions and the supporting infrastructure to meet the requirements of inward investors.  The agency recognises the need to achieve high value employment in Thurles and is committed to marketing the area as part of its national goal of achieving balanced regional development.  It has five supported companies in north Tipperary, employing some 680 people, one of which, a pharmaceutical distributor, is in Thurles.  In addition, investments by two companies in Roscrea and Templemore will result in significant additional employment for the whole area including the surrounding towns.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">The agency also works closely with Shannon Development in the development, promotion and marketing of tailored property solutions to potential investors throughout the mid-west, including the development of Tipperary Technology Park in Thurles.  Shannon Development has completed the first stage development of Tipperary Technology Park, which includes 25,000 sq. ft. state-of-the-art accommodation, to facilitate the attraction and development of knowledge-based enterprises.  The park is a component of IDA Ireland's international marketing programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">Enterprise Ireland activity in Thurles and north Tipperary is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies and the retention and creation of jobs in existing companies.  The agency also works with its clients to enhance the innovation capability of Irish companies at both national and regional levels.  A significant number of Enterprise Ireland client companies in the county are actively developing their businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">During 2006, North Tipperary County Enterprise Board approved a total of €295,389 to 16 projects and paid out €238,850 in grant assistance to 18 projects, which resulted in the creation of 21 net jobs in CEB assisted companies throughout north Tipperary.  North Tipperary CEB also organised 56 different types of training interventions during 2006, based on meeting the wide and varied needs of the small business owner-managers of north Tipperary.  Some 629 participants attended training programmes run by the CEB during 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">The most recent data available, which is for October 2007, shows a figure of 963 on the live register, which is down from the September 2007 figure of 1,000 people.  The strategies and policies pursued by the State development agencies, in partnership with other key players, are designed to ensure new employment opportunities in the Thurles and north Tipperary area.  The aim is to replace the companies referred to by Deputy Lowry with the companies of tomorrow.  There has been a significant churn in the economy which has been reflected in the north Tipperary area.  I am conscious of the need to work with the agencies in tackling this situation.  I will get back to the Deputy in the coming days to develop the coordinated and cohesive response he demanded.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_749">In spring during the run-up to the teacher unions' conferences and the general election, the Minister for Education and Science announced to a media fanfare that a primary school, under the patronage of the VEC, would be built for Diswellstown, Castleknock, Dublin 15.  The Minister's decision was seen as an overdue response to the large number of children seeking primary school places, a consequence of the thousands of new homes built in the area and the failure of the Department of Education and Science to build a sufficient number of primary schools to meet demand.  Despite her promises and the general welcome by Dublin county VEC to the proposal, it never happened.  Why did the Minister run away from her promise, a belated response to a dreadful school places crisis facing parents and children?  Instead, the community of Dublin 15 had an awful summer as parents jostled frantically to secure places for their children in the nearest primary school.  Frantic parents and stressed children face the same situation this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">The Minister's emergency last minute response of begging the Catholic Church to act as patron for two years or more of a new Catholic primary school, Scoil Colm, has had a predictable outcome.  Scoil Colm is perceived as a school for "others", children of non-Irish parents, and is one of several primary schools in Dublin 15 where there are few or no children of Irish parents.  When the children are bussed out in the morning one can see that this is a school for immigrant children.  Has the Minister abandoned the VEC-patroned school for Diswellstown that she had promised?  Does she have a site and has she discussed the proposal formally with the County Dublin VEC?  Her inaction and cowardice in this area are leading to the development of segregated schools for non-Irish and Irish-born children of foreign immigrants.   One set of parents is being pitted against another.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">The Government states repeatedly that it wishes to avoid ghettoisation.  Segregated schooling is the quickest route to building ghettoes.  Is that the Minister's intention?  Fingal County Council recently announced, as requested by the Minister, a programme of school building for Dublin 15 and Fingal.  Has the Minister secured the funding for this from the Minister for Finance or is this more pie in the sky?  Is the promised Diswellstown school included in this plan or has the project been dropped, as I suspect?</p>
            <p eId="para_752">The Minister needs to come out of hiding and honestly address these difficult and complex issues.  I have called for a new national convention on education to address the question of who will be the patrons of new schools in new areas with diverse communities, and how we provide for a different ethos, religion or other delicate issue.  We want the Minister to face up to the management of primary schools in a changing Ireland.  We want identified enrolment policies in primary schools that will make them inclusive rather than ghettoised. Does domestic and EU equality legislation apply in this environment and how will the Department address these issues?</p>
            <p eId="para_753">School sites should be acquired when permission is granted for the building of thousands of houses and apartments.  The Department should face up to its responsibilities from the day planning permission is granted, not ten years after the homes have been built and occupied.  This has been the style of this Government, which puts the interests of its friends in the construction industry ahead of those of parents and children.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_325">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_754">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter as it allows me to apprise the House of the background to, and progress in piloting, a new model of community primary school in Diswellstown.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">Historically, the church authorities, mainly Catholic and Church of Ireland, acted as patrons or sponsors of primary schools by initiating the process of establishing a new school when one was needed to serve a specific geographic area.  This model of school provision has evolved incrementally to reflect changes in demand and in the expectations of society, notably the demand for diversity.  With these changes, there has been an increase in the number of patron bodies seeking recognition for new schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">The present model of primary school provision has served the country well.  When the Minister for Education and Science announced her intention earlier this year to pilot a new patron model for primary schools, she made it clear that this would provide an additional patronage option and was not intended to replace the existing patron models.  Following her announcement, officials in the Department engaged in consultations with the education partners and the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee to explore the detailed implementation measures that must be put in place prior to the opening of the proposed new school.</p>
            <p eId="para_757">The new model will be introduced on a pilot basis in the first instance at a school to be built in Diswellstown, County Dublin.  It is intended that this school will be community-based and will operate within the administrative framework of the County Dublin VEC.  Once the pilot phase has been evaluated and the various issues that may arise identified and resolved, consideration can be given to allowing other VECs to establish community primary schools.  Meanwhile, my Department will continue to prepare for the establishment phase for the Diswellstown school.  While the exact location of the new school in Diswellstown has yet to be finalised, two potential sites are being considered and my Department has asked Fingal County Council to expedite the process as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_758">The Department has intervened at primary level in the Dublin 15 area in response to the acknowledged need for considerable extra school places.  These interventions include measures to increase the capacity of existing schools, as well as the development of new schools to meet the growing demand.  The provision of increased places is, and will continue to be, backed up by a significant construction programme which has already delivered three new primary schools in the recent past, with another on site.  Together with radical changes in how projects are planned and delivered, adequate primary school places in west Dublin will be ensured well into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">My Department is advancing plans to make considerable extra post-primary provision available in the Dublin 15 area.  Four such schools will be provided in the coming years, each catering for 1,000 pupils.  These schools are being provided in Phibblestown, Tyrellstown, Hansfield and Castleknock.  Last Friday the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, officially opened the new Educate Together national school in Castleknock, Dublin 15, catering for a student population of some 400, which cost over €5 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">My Department will liaise with the local authority and use its other information sources to ensure that whatever other school accommodation needs emerge in the Dublin 15 area will be addressed as expeditiously as possible.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and allowing me to clarify the position on the pilot patron model and ongoing developments in the area.</p>

          <speech by="#RoryOHanlon" eId="spk_326">
            <from>Deputy Rory O’Hanlon</from>
            <p eId="para_761">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Killeen, for coming in to deal with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">I fully support the North-South electricity interconnector.  There has been a great change since the last one was put in place, which lay idle for 30 years because of the violence in Northern Ireland.  We are pleased with the present level of co-operation North and South because it will ensure the supply of electricity in a growing market and will hopefully reduce the cost.  Nobody at the meetings I attended opposed this connector.</p>
            <p eId="para_763">I am aware that this is primarily a matter for EirGrid, not directly for the Government.  My colleague, Deputy Margaret Conlon, and I attended many meetings in County Monaghan where concern was expressed about the visual impact of the interconnector.  EirGrid will consider this in the planning process under the strict guidelines of the Strategic Infrastructure Act.  The issue of prime concern is health, and people were unanimous that the cable should be underground.  I ask EirGrid to consider whether this is possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_764">The health concerns expressed are similar to those expressed when telephone masts were erected.  However, I am satisfied that there is no serious health risk regarding low frequency power lines.  I believe the State bodies involved will adhere to the strict guidelines laid down by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection, the World Health Organisation and the European Union.  This does not, however, solve the problem of those who fear they are at risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">The most important point I will make tonight relates to communication.  EirGrid must communicate with all stakeholders, including those who live along the proposed routes from which one will be selected.  EirGrid must contact each household and ensure people's health fears are alleviated because, while this matter poses no direct risk to one's health, lying awake at night worrying about a perceived risk could damage a person's health.  I ask that EirGrid examine the possibility of running cabling underground as this would alleviate the fears of all concerned.  The company must also ensure that factual information on this issue is made available to the public because there was a great deal of misinformation at the meetings we attended and many people are frightened by what is happening.  It is important that these fears are dealt with and this can be done if EirGrid contacts all householders and invites them to attend explanatory meetings where the relevant information is available and people can make up their own minds.</p>
            <p eId="para_766">We support this project and hope to see it proceed but would like to see it supported by local stakeholders, which can be achieved if their anxiety is alleviated.</p>

            <p eId="para_767">I thank Deputy Rory O'Hanlon for the opportunity to comment on the issue of electromagnetic radiation associated with 400kv power lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">The Government published earlier this year the report of the expert group on the health effects of electromagnetic fields.  The expert group was established by an inter-departmental committee that examined Government policy regarding the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, EMF, with reference to the recommendations of the 2005 report of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, titled "Non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts".</p>
            <p eId="para_769">The report examined a wide range of issues relating to the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields, including those produced by mobile telecommunications.  It answers many questions commonly raised by the public regarding the health effects of electromagnetic fields and can be downloaded from the Department's website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">With regard to extremely low frequency, ELF, fields emitted by electricity power lines, including 400kv power lines, the report concluded that there is limited scientific evidence of adverse health effects.  The expert group has recommended that precautionary measures be used where appropriate and that Ireland continue to adopt and enforce the international guidelines developed by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection and endorsed by the World Health Organisation and the European Union.  For example, where possible new power lines should be sited away from heavily populated areas and where major new power lines are to be constructed there should be stakeholder input on the routing.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">The Government also decided that the responsibilities of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources regarding the health effects of EMF would become the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government from 1 May 2007.  Furthermore, it was decided that a single State agency should be established to deal both with ionising radiation and non-ionising radiation.  This will be achieved by extending the statutory powers of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to include responsibility for matters relating to non-ionising radiation.  The details of implementation of the new mandate for the RPII will be presented to Government for approval in due course by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, following detailed consultation with other relevant Government Departments and agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">The Government has also agreed to establish a national research programme to undertake further scientific research in Ireland on the health effects of exposure to EMF.  This research programme will build expertise in Ireland and contribute to global knowledge.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">With regard to the planning aspect of power lines, section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides planning authorities with the discretionary power to grant planning permission, subject to conditions as appropriate, to the individual project.  Under the Strategic Infrastructure Act 2006 An Bord Pleanála has powers to attach conditions in respect of applications made to it under the new strategic consent process.  With regard to electricity transmission lines specifically, this means that planning authorities and the board already have powers to require that power lines be placed underground if, for example, they are in close proximity to inhabited dwellings or exceed a particular voltage.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">The interpretation and implementation of planning legislation is a matter for the planning authority concerned in each case and ultimately for the courts.  However, the legislation sets out that in making decisions on planning applications planning authorities must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant ministerial or Government policies.</p>

        <b>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if her attention has been drawn to the fact that there are only 127 educational psychologists serving more than 800,000 students, with only half of existing primary and secondary schools having access to such services; if her Department has plans to properly fund the provision of extra psychologists in order to curb the high rate of ADHD, depression and suicide among young people; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_776">The Deputy will, I'm sure, be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA and have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS. The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">The Deputy will also be aware that since NEPS was established, we have trebled the number of psychologists in the service. Notwithstanding this and as I have previously announced my Department is committed to increasing psychological service staffing further, so that by 2009 there will be 200 NEPS psychologists.  To this end I can inform the Deputy that my Department has been working, in conjunction with the Public Appointments Commission to recruit new psychologists from an existing panel to the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">The number of psychologists as of April 2007 stood at 128 including 4 assigned to the National Behavioural Support Service and to the Further Education Service. Since then nine individuals have been appointed in this regard. This advance in numbers has been reduced somewhat by the effects of resignations and retirement and the compliment in service currently stands at 134. Three further psychologists are due to join NEPS under this process between now and early January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">The panel concerned is now exhausted and the Public Appointments Service has recently announced the commencement of a competition from which a new panel will be drawn to continue the recruitment process. The deadline for receipt of applications in this regard has now passed and work is proceeding on the short-listing of candidates for interview. It is envisaged that the process will be completed and panels formed by the end of next month allowing recruitment to re-commence early in 2008. My Department remains committed to the development of a strong and robust educational psychological service serving the needs of all primary and post-primary pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">The occurrence of ADHD and Depression amongst young people is a serious issue which falls, in the first instance, into the province of clinical diagnosis and treatment by the appropriate health professionals. However schools fulfil an important role in this regard especially in terms of prevention. Such prevention needs to be addressed at whole school level through provision of relevant curricula for all children, through effective implementation of the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) programme, and through the provision of the supports afforded by a good care system, including the capacity to respond appropriately to early signs of difficulty. The development of self-esteem, general coping skills and personal effectiveness is the most appropriate way to help the general population of young people to deal with life pressures and stress. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">All post-primary schools have an ex-quota allocation for guidance and counselling provision. Qualified guidance counsellors are trained to provide counselling support to students and the guidance programme seeks to equip students with self management skills and encourages students to seek help during times of stress. Where children exhibit symptoms teachers, tutors, guidance counsellors, home school liaison co-ordinators and the services of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) can all play an important role in this respect and where necessary make referral to the appropriate health agencies for definitive diagnosis and treatment.</p>

            <p eId="para_783">The reply of 2 October 2007 dealt with the issue of implementation of Relationships and Sexuality Education in second level schools. The content of the Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE)  curriculum for primary schools was developed as part of the revised Primary Curriculum which has been implemented  on a phased basis over the period 1999 to 2007.  Social Personal and Health Education has been part of the national curriculum in all primary schools since September 2003.  It is delivered to children at all levels from infants upwards.   It provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, health and well-being of the individual child, to help the child to create and maintain supportive relationships and to become an active responsible citizen in society.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">The curriculum is built around 3 strands – Myself, Myself and Others, and Myself and the Wider world, and deals with issues such as making decisions,  developing self confidence, growing and changing, personal safety, relating to friends, family and others, handling conflict, respecting difference and awareness of bullying. Issues such as knowing about and taking care of one's body,  feelings and emotions,  the onset of puberty, reproduction,  decision making skills, staying safe, realising when and how to get help are dealt with. The content of relationships and sexuality education is embedded in the programme in an age appropriate way for the different class groupings.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">All primary schools are required to implement all aspects of the curriculum. A report on Phase 1 of the evaluation of implementation of the revised primary curriculum was published in 2005 focusing on English, Mathematics and Visual Arts.  A Phase 2 evaluation is now under way focusing on Gaeilge, Science and Social Personal and Health Education. This will evaluate the implementation of the SPHE curriculum in schools, and review the effectiveness of the delivery of the RSE components within the curriculum.</p>

            <p eId="para_788">As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has been prioritising developing areas for investment under the School Building and Modernisation Programme. During the period of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006, record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems allowed a major acceleration of the school building programme. Over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level. This was the largest investment programme in the history of the State and delivered over 7,800 building projects involving tens of thousands of extra permanent school places.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model have been introduced to ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time-frame possible. Much greater authority has also been devolved to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thereby freeing my Department to concentrate on the larger scale projects. We have also improved forward planning through greater cooperation with Local Authorities and the publication of 10-year Area Development Plans. All of these developments have facilitated the provision of extra school places in extensions and new schools in developing areas all over the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">The budget for 2007 is the first year of the roll out of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school buildings. This funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation particularly in developing areas. We are planning for an expected 100,000 additional school places over the lifetime of the Plan. This year alone around over €540 million will be spent on school building infrastructure with over 1,500 projects on my Department's school building programme. Construction in 2007 alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">The Programme for Government includes a commitment to establish a Developing Areas Unit in my Department, dedicated solely to progressing school planning in rapidly developing areas, building on improvements that have already been made in recent years. I should point out that my Department's school planning section has been organised on a geographical basis for some time, with staff dedicated to planning for the needs of counties such as Dublin, Meath and Kildare which include rapidly developing areas. The developing areas unit will consolidate this work. In advance of the full establishment of the unit, some staff have already been redeployed to focus on its priority work, including the need for extra accommodation for September 2008. Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance in relation to the additional staffing required to resource this new unit for its longer term work programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">As part of our strategy for the provision of school places for 2008 and onwards my Department has also initiated a tender process for a drawdown contract facility that will be used to provide additional school places in the rapidly developing areas. This drawdown contract facility is aimed at providing school accommodation in very short timescales using modern methodologies such as off-site construction. Both I and my senior officials have met with the relevant local authorities in relation to the acquisition of suitable sites for new schools and, where possible, pre-empting any planning issues that may arise. This close cooperation with local authorities will help ensure that additional school places are provided in the developing areas within the earliest possible timeframes.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_794">My Department is notified annually of the details of all pupils attending post primary schools. This information is provided by each school via the October return and is used for a number of purposes, including the production of statistics on the retention of pupils in the post primary school system. In addition to this the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, places an obligation on schools to report on school attendance to the National Educational Welfare Board. Schools are asked to submit information about individual student absences under various categories including students who drop out of school.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving. We established the National Educational Welfare Board to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school. The Board runs promotional campaigns on the importance of attendance and finishing school and provides a service locally through its Education Welfare Officers to parents, children and schools. It is encouraging to note research findings that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved by 4% in 2004/05 compared with the previous year.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">My Department is also currently implementing DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) an action plan for educational inclusion. DEIS is an integrated educational inclusion strategy developed for 3-18 year olds and represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing particular problems to a multi-faceted and more integrated approach.  In addition to the NEWB there are some 620 staff, within the education sector, deployed in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS. The School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) are preventative measures designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. Children at risk of early school leaving are targeted under the School Completion Programme for a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">Other measures facilitated through the DEIS action plan include extending access to Schools' Business Partnerships, school meals, guidance counselling and student councils. Increased integration is also being promoted between the work of second-level schools and centres catering for young early school leavers, particularly Youthreach centres and Senior Traveller Training centres.  The range of curricula available to students has also been extended to include the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. These options provide an alternative for many children who might otherwise opt out of formal education at an early stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">This Government has shown a sustained commitment to providing greater opportunities in the further education sector by supporting second chance educational opportunities for young people who leave school. Many of these young people take up places in Youthreach centres, while others pursue options such as FAS apprenticeships. In line with the commitment in Towards 2016 we have already created 400 of the additional 1000 Youthreach places to be put in place by 2009.  A further measure to combat the contributing factor of poor behaviour on early school leaving was to put in place the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS). Fifty schools were identified to receive support and the NBSS is working intensively with these schools. An allocation of €8 million has been provided in 2007 to support the work of the NBSS to help schools promote positive student behaviour at second level.</p>

It should be noted that the number of second level students decreased over the period and that there was one teacher for almost every 13 post-primary pupils in the 2006/07 school year.  There were 463 additional WTE teachers for mainstream and PLCs allocated to the VEC sector in that period.  2,732 more special needs assistants were employed in primary schools in September 2007 than in September 2004, while 1,080 more were employed in post-primary schools including Vocational Education Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">2,709 primary teachers retired between 2004 and 2007. 2,311 teachers employed in Secondary and Community/ Comprehensive schools also retired.

            <p eId="para_812">At primary level it is a matter for each Local Authority to provide a library service for schools in its area. While my Department has no involvement in the actual operation of this service, it does make a grant available to each Local Authority on an annual basis to enable Local Authority Librarians select, purchase, and deliver books to the primary schools in its area. The grant is based on the number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in each Local Authority area.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">Enrolment data is based on the Annual Primary School Census which provides information on the enrolment and staffing of all schools at the last Friday in September of each year.  This information forms the basis for how the Department provides teachers and grants to schools and is also the basis on which library grants are made to Local Authorities. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the provision in respect of library grants has been increased from €1.5 million in 2004 to €2.118 million in 2007, an increase of more then 40% since 2004. The question of increasing the provision in the future will be considered in the context of available resources and priorities within the education sector.</p>

         if, with reference to her press statement of 17 February 2007 announcing her plans to establish Diswellstown Community National School, it is still her position that no other VEC primary schools will be recognised until the initial pilot school is evaluated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_815">Historically, the church authorities (mainly Catholic and Church of Ireland) acted as patrons or sponsors of primary schools by initiating the process of establishing a new school when one was needed to serve a specific geographic area. This model of school provision has been incrementally evolving to reflect changes in demand and in the expectations of society, notably the demand for diversity. With these changes, there has been an increase in the number of patron bodies seeking recognition for new schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">The present model of primary school provision has served the country well. When I announced my intention earlier this year to pilot a new patron model for primary schools, I made it clear that this would provide an additional patronage option and is not intended to serve as a replacement of the existing patron models. The new model will be introduced on a pilot basis in the first instance at a school to be built in Diswellstown, Co Dublin. It is intended that this school will be community-based and will operate within the administrative framework of the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">Following my announcement, officials in my Department engaged in consultations with the education partners and the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee to explore the detailed implementation measures that will need to be put in place prior to the opening of the proposed new school. The proposal to pilot the new model has been broadly welcomed by the partners. Pending the completion of the consultation process and the evaluation of the pilot phase, I decided as a matter of policy that no vocational education committee (with the exception of the pilot project within the administrative area of the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee) should act as a patron in respect of a primary school or otherwise establish or maintain a primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">I therefore directed all Vocational Education Committees not to establish or maintain a primary school and not to seek recognition of a primary school until further notice from my Department. The purpose of this direction was to ensure that all aspects of the establishment process were given careful consideration before the model was adopted at national level. I was especially anxious to avoid a situation whereby different Vocational Education Committees might inadvertently adopt varying and possibility contradictory approaches to what is a very complex area.  Once the pilot phase has been fully evaluated and the various issues that may arise have been identified and resolved, consideration can be given to allowing other Vocational Education Committees to establish community primary schools.  In the meantime, my Department will continue with the preparatory work in advance of the establishment phase for the Diswellstown school.</p>

            <p eId="para_828">I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 was enacted in July 2004. The Special Education Appeals Board (SEAB) was established under section 36 of the EPSEN Act to hear and determine appeals pursuant to a number of sections of the Act. Members of the inaugural appeals board have been appointed and are currently working on the development of processes and procedures which need to be in place before the relevant sections of the Act, which provide for appeals, are commenced. The following sections have been commenced:- 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4), 19 to 37, 40 to 44, 45-49 and 50 to 53. The remaining sections have not yet been commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">As the EPSEN Act does not provide for phased commencement by age cohort the education sector must be in a position to provide the required services to all children before the relevant provisions are commenced. My Department's priority, therefore, has been to put in place the resources required for children with special educational needs and to ensure that the necessary supports are in place to facilitate the commencement of the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act. At primary level, there are now over 6,000 teachers working directly with children with special educational needs compared with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. At post primary level, over 2,450 whole-time equivalent teachers support special needs students compared with 200 in 1998. The number of Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) has increased from 300 in 1998 to over 8,800 in 2007 and the amount allocated for assistive technology has increased from less than €1m in 1998 to €3m in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">The National Council for Special Education was required by the legislation to advise on implementation of the Act. My Department has been examining the Council's advice and in this connection has held a series of consultations with the education partners on implementation issues.  Arising from this process my Department is developing proposals for the implementation of the Act. It is hoped to complete this work shortly. At the same time my Department continues to provide for the allocation of additional resources through the Council to enhance the capacity of the education system to meet special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">My Department has also been collaborating with the Department of Health and Children, the National Council for Special Education and the Health Service Executive to ensure that the implementation of the EPSEN and Disability Acts are progressed in a co-ordinated manner. To this end a Cross Sectoral Group representative of officials from the education and health sectors has been established to progress the work in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">There are varying estimates of the number of children with special educational needs. The National Council for Special Education is currently compiling data on children in respect of whom resources have been allocated and has also indicated that it proposes to strengthen the area of prevalence data. My Department will support the Council's efforts in this regard.  As outlined above, the sections of the EPSEN Act in respect of assessments and individual education plans have not yet commenced. However as already stated services continue to be provided to children with special educational needs on a non-statutory basis.</p>

        <b>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if her Department is making provision to provide more school places for pupils entering the primary school system in 2012 in view of the recent report (details supplied) that highlighted that Ireland’s birth rate is expected to increase by 11% compared to 2006; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [28454/07]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_337">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_835">The annual total of births in Ireland has been increasing since 1995. As a direct consequence of this, enrolments at Primary level have been increasing since 2001/02 and are projected to continue increasing for the foreseeable future. Inward migration is another factor pushing up enrolment at both primary and second level in recent years together with an underlying increase in participation — especially beyond the compulsory school-leaving age.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">While any projection into the future is tentative and dependent on many factors that are not subject to policy control or absolute confirmation, it is highly probable that enrolment at primary level will increase by at least 20% over the coming decade. That implies an increase on last year's level of 458,000 pupils at primary level to approximately 555,000 in 2015/16. In other words, enrolment will regain the level recorded in 1989 by the year 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">To deal with this increasing demand for school places, the Government is providing funding of €4.5 billion over the lifetime of the new National Development Plan (NDP). This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and it will enable my Department to ensure that school places are available where needed as well as continuing to upgrade existing school facilities. This investment will allow my Department to continue the school building programme which commenced during the life time of the last NDP when well over €2.6 billion was invested in school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">The budget for 2007 is the first year of the roll out of the new NDP. This funding will enable my Department to continue to provide modern school accommodation on an on-going basis, particularly in developing areas. This year alone around over €540 million will be spent on school building infrastructure with over 1,500 projects on my Department's school building programme. Construction in 2007 alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time-frame possible. My Department has also adopted a policy of devolving much greater authority to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thereby freeing the Department to concentrate on the larger scale projects. My Department has also improved forward planning through greater cooperation between it and Local Authorities and the publication of Area Development Plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">The main focus of the school building programme is to deliver additional capacity in the rapidly developing areas. It is projected that 100,000 additional school places will be required over the next number of years. I am conscious of the need to provide more school places quickly and these are being delivered. As part of our strategy for the provision of school places for 2008 and onwards my Department has also initiated a tender process for a drawdown contract facility that will be used to provide additional school places in the rapidly developing areas. This drawdown contract facility is aimed at providing school accommodation in very short timescales using modern methodologies such as off-site construction. Both I and my senior officials have met with the relevant local authorities in relation to the acquisition of suitable sites for new schools and, where possible, pre-empting any planning issues that may arise. This close cooperation with local authorities will help ensure that additional school places are provided in the developing areas within the earliest possible timeframes.</p>

            <p eId="para_848">The information on class sizes for the 2007/08 school year is currently being compiled in my Department.  As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.  A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years in order to reduce class sizes. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_857">Existing education policy is that students up to 18 years of age are admitted to primary and second level schools irrespective of their nationality or status. Indeed, under the Equal Status Act, schools may not discriminate in admission to schools except where this is necessary to maintain the religions values or ethos of the school. While the Act does provide for differential treatment in relation to fees for further and higher education for persons who are not nationals of an EU Member State, there is no such condition specified in regard to second level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">The admission of persons to the State from outside the EU is a matter for the immigration authorities. Children of refugees, those with humanitarian leave to remain in the State, and asylum seekers are entitled to access free first and second level education. However, the basic conditions for a student visa require that the student attend a full time programme of education and training, and be financially self supporting.  The Report on the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Internationalisation of Irish Education, published in 2004, set out a strategy with the objective of enhancing the attractiveness of Ireland as a quality venue for international students and increasing the numbers of students coming to Ireland to participate in further and higher education and training and in the language sector. It was envisaged that students from outside the EU/EEA and Switzerland, other than refugees and those with humanitarian leave to remain in the State, would participate on a fee paying basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">In the course of the discussions leading to the Report, the position of minors attending school for second level education was discussed, and the existing immigration policy that student visas should be allowed only in respect of attendance at fee-paying schools was confirmed, on the basis that to do otherwise would give rise to additional demands on the State.  In overall discussions with the immigration authorities in regard to student visas at second level, my Department has made clear the requirements under the Equal Status Act, has stressed the need to take due account of the age and vulnerability of children who, while having no entitlement to remain in the State, may already be enrolled in schools in the Free Education Scheme, and the importance of completion of second level education to future life chances.</p>

            <p eId="para_861">The question of whether children walk to and from school or are driven as part of a car pooling initiative is a matter for decision by their parents. However, it is clear that walking to school can make an important contribution to children's health and to developing their sense of road safety as well as decreasing traffic congestion around school routes. Many local authorities have developed schemes to encourage walking to school, through initiatives such as the organisation of a ‘walking bus', the provision of school traffic wardens, the organisation of Walk to School Weeks, and the development of ‘park and stride' initiatives. Local authorities are also involved in promoting car pooling initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">An Taisce's Green Schools Initiative includes initiatives such as the Safer Routes to School Project which aims to increase the number of children who walk and cycle, increase the number of families who ‘park and stride' or ‘carpool', and reduce school-related congestion. The Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) Programme in all primary schools includes a specific ‘safety and protection' strand which is designed to develop in children an increasing sense of personal responsibility for their own safety and that of others. The learning objectives of this strand specifically include such issues as safety strategies for crossing the road, using the bus or being a pedestrian, crossing the road with an adult, and being familiar with the rules for travelling in a car or bus, or on a bicycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">SPHE is also a mandatory junior cycle subject at second-level. The SPHE curriculum at both primary level and in the junior cycle at second-level stresses the importance of daily exercise and a healthy diet to maintaining health and well being. The ‘personal safety' strand of the junior cycle programme includes such issues as road safety and is supported by a range of curriculum materials. In addition, a road safety programme for use in Transition Year has been developed and is currently being piloted by the Road Safety Authority in collaboration with my Department, the NCCA and the Second Level Support Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">In addition school transport services are operated by Bus Éireann on behalf my Department.  Some 135,000 children are carried annually under the scheme, of which 8,500 are children with special needs.  Transport is provided by Bus Éireann and private providers with a mix of large, medium and minibuses, as well as a number of car taxis.  One of the effects of provision on this scale is to lessen the amount of children being transported to school in cars.  The Department of Transport has also begun the process of developing a Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan, which the Government is committed to publishing in the Spring of 2008.  My Department is represented on the Steering Group set up to oversee the development of the plan, and the plan will specifically address the issues relating to children travelling to and from school.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">Finally, in February of this year, the Road Safety Authority launched the RSA MACE "Safe to School" campaign at primary level, which is aimed at helping primary school children learn effective road safety lessons. The first part of this campaign is about walking to school safely and as part of this initiative educational packs and DVDs have been distributed to all primary schools and a Walking to School Guide has been produced. A dedicated website, www.safetoschool.ie, has also been launched as part of the campaign.</p>

        <b>Deputy Emmet Stagg</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         if her attention has been drawn to the fact that the average cost of rented accommodation for students in Dublin city centre is €600 per month and that the grant system forces many students to seek part-time work to support themselves, thus not giving adequate attention to their studies; if she will include a speedy, efficient, centralised grant system in the forthcoming Student Support Bill; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_869">As the Deputy may be aware, I secured approval for a 10% increase in the standard rate of student grant for the academic year 2007/08. This very substantial increase, at twice the rate of inflation, will assist in meeting the costs associated with attending higher and further education for over 56,000 students who receive a maintenance grant. This has resulted in an increase in the maximum rate of ordinary grant to €3,420 for 2007/08 and students who qualify will also have the student service charge paid on their behalf.  In addition, over 12,500 students in receipt of the Special Rate of maintenance grant have benefited from an even more substantial increase of over 14%, with the maximum rate for 2007/08 increasing to €6,690.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students and to consolidate the administration of this unified grants scheme in the VEC sector. This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administrative system. The scheme, which will be underpinned by a new Student Support Bill, will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants. The Student Support Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation, and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. For planning purposes the country was divided into geographic districts each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was that these defined districts would facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs. The Programme for Government provides for a review of the school transport scheme, including catchment boundaries, to be carried out.  My Department is currently considering how this review should best be undertaken.</p>

            <p eId="para_876">The information requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of PE teachers employed in second level schools is not readily available within my Department.  Teacher allocations for second level schools are approved by my Department on an annual basis in accordance with generally applied rules based on recognised pupil enrolments on the 30th of September of the preceding school year.  Each school management authority is required to organise its curriculum, teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils' needs within the limits of its approved teacher allocation. The appointment of teachers to posts within the approved quota is a matter for the authorities of the schools concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">At primary level, Physical Education is one of the seven curriculum areas and is an intrinsic element of the Primary School Curriculum which was revised in 1999. A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils. All qualified Primary teachers are qualified to teach the full spectrum of the Primary Curriculum including Physical Education.</p>

            <p eId="para_879">In determining the pupil teacher ratio at primary level, all teachers in primary schools are counted, not only those employed as mainstream classroom teachers, but also those working in areas such as resource teaching and language support. In determining class size in primary schools, class teachers are counted.  Pupil Teacher Ratio in respect of all primary schools is currently only available at national level and is not disaggregated by school or any other variable.The following is the Pupil Teacher Ratio nationally since September 2002:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_880">2002/03,  18.0;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_881">2003/04, 17.44;</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_883">2005/06, 17;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_884">2006/07, 16.4.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">The Pupil Teacher Ratio for the 2007/08 school year is currently being compiled in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">The following tables indicate the number of pupils by class size by county for the years 2002/03 to 2006/07.  Information in relation to class sizes is provided in the annual census of primary schools. The data relating to class size for the 2007/08 school year will not be available until this process has been completed later in the school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this. Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.  The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years in order to reduce class sizes. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_2340">However, a separate evaluation of DEIS, the Action Plan on Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, is under way,  focused on schools in the School Support Programme of DEIS.  This is being prioritised to ensure base line data which will enable the impact of the DEIS programme to be assessed over the period to 2009/10. In spring  2007,  baseline achievement data, based on tests in English and Mathematics, has been gathered by the Educational Research Centre  from about 17,000 pupils in a sample of almost 500 participating schools.  Pupils took tests in English and mathematics in second, third, and sixth class in the urban strand of SSP, and in third and sixth class in the rural strand of the programme.   Testing will be repeated in the same schools and with many of the same pupils in the spring of 2010.  The data gathered from the DEIS evaluation will provide important information for the DEIS strand of the national monitoring programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2347">The level of extra financial or teaching support provided to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible non-English speaking students enrolled. I indicated in January last that the limit of two teachers per school and the limit of two years' support to an individual pupil which had applied up to then, will no longer apply. As a result, an individual school may be allocated up to six language support posts under the arrangements now in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">Schools with between 3 and 13 eligible pupils receive grant assistance towards the cost of employing part-time teachers. Schools with 3 to 8 such pupils receive a grant of over €6,300, while schools with between 9 and 13 such pupils receive over €9,500.  Schools with 14 or more such pupils are entitled to one or more language support teachers, the number of which has increased dramatically in recent years.

The IILT materials will also enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of the language proficiency of the child and his or her need for continued language support.</p>

            <p eId="para_2351">The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the process, as the school authorities would usually alert the Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend capacity or provide new infrastructure where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">In addition, Local Authorities are obliged by statute to refer draft local area development plans to the Department for observation and comment so that lands can be zoned for future education use. There are numerous sites reserved for education purposes particularly in the rapidly developing areas so as to ensure that there will be sufficient land set aside and available for the future development of education infrastructure.  Over and above the statutory consultation provisions in relation to local authority draft area development plans, the Department has in recent years worked to strengthen contacts with local authorities to enable informed decisions to be made in planning future educational provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2353">My Department makes extensive use of data from the Census of Population for a variety of purposes including long-term projections of enrolment at national and local level. The census results for 2006 are of use in identifying broad trends in total population by county and local area.  School Planning Section use census data when drafting area development plans and planning school provision for likely enrolment at local area level.  It should be borne in mind that Census data do not provide a completely precise guide to future enrolment patterns in any particular locality. Given the time lag involved from Census date to publication of detailed results by area and age as well as uncertainties about trends in enrolment across area boundaries, care is needed in making detailed projections into the future for any specific locality.</p>
            <p eId="para_2354">The Deputy may be aware that the Programme for Government includes a commitment to establish a Developing Areas Unit in my Department.  The unit will be solely dedicated to progressing school planning in rapidly developing areas, building on improvements that have already been made in school planning, in recent years.  Staff in the unit will liaise with local authorities, identify where new schools are needed and ensure that they are delivered in the fastest possible timeframe.</p>

            <p eId="para_2358">I presume that the Deputy is referring to the issue of tuition fees for students studying in Northern Ireland.  Under my Department's Free Fees Initiative the Exchequer meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved undergraduate third-level courses in the State. There are no plans to extend this initiative to cover third level institutions in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">Under my Department's Higher Education Grant Schemes, maintenance grants are available to eligible students pursuing approved undergraduate courses in other EU Member States, including Northern Ireland. In general, approved courses are those pursued in a third level institution, which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. However the payment of undergraduate tuition fees under these schemes does not extend to approved courses outside the State and there are no plans to change this position at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_2360">It is understood however that students attending Higher Education Institutions in Northern Ireland and who are ordinarily resident in a Member State of the European Union will be eligible for a fee loan from the Northern Ireland Authorities up to the amount charged by the Higher Education Institution.

            <p eId="para_2363">The type of Lease involved, in the case of State investment in privately-owned schools, is not a demise of property but rather it puts a charge on the property. This charge, on the Department's behalf, is registered as a burden on the relevant folio and requires to be legally surrendered by the Department should the owner of the property wish to sell. This charge does not permit the Department to prevent the property owner from selling. However, the Department may seek a full or partial refund of the capital investment, which is the subject of the Lease, in accordance with the terms of the individual Lease.</p>
            <p eId="para_2364">As part of our ongoing modernisation of administrative systems and delivery methods, the School Building Section is in the process of finalising a generic Deed of Covenant and Charge to protect State investment in privately-owned schools. This will be more flexible and less onerous to put in place than the old-style Lease. However, as with the old-style Lease, the Deed will empower the Department only to re-coup its investment should the owner decide to sell or otherwise to cease operation as an educational facility. It does not confer the power to prevent a sale in such circumstances, as long as appropriate recoupment is made by the property owner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2365">The draft Deed of Covenant and Charge is currently being examined in my Department in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's Office.

            <p eId="para_2367">Quality assurance in higher education is governed by statutory provision and is based upon expert peer review, of both Irish and international experts, which must include representation from students, business and other stakeholders.  The Irish system of higher education quality assurance system itself has been reviewed and I would refer the Deputy to the independent report of the European Universities Association on the university quality assurance system, published in 2005. That review found that the Irish system, with its emphasis not only on quality assurance, but also quality improvement, could act as a model internationally.

            <p eId="para_2370">The specific data requested by the Deputy is not available to my Department. The emphasis placed by this Government on tackling educational disadvantage in recent years is absolutely unprecedented. Since 2003, we have increased investment in educational inclusion measures at all levels by no less than 60%, to €730 million in 2007.  We are determined to ensure that young people from disadvantaged areas get the support they need to encourage them to finish school. To this end, we have provided additional investment in a wide range of areas, including extra teachers, grants for books, homework clubs, school meals and summer camps. We have also expanded access to important services such as the Home School Community Liaison scheme and the School Completion Programme which work with students at risk of early school leaving and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_2371">Indeed, there are now approximately 620 staff working in services such as these, including over 130 extra posts allocated under the DEIS Action Plan over the past two years. In addition, the National Educational Welfare Board now has over 100 staff, and is specifically tasked with tackling attendance problems that if left unchecked can culminate in young people dropping out of school. There is an emphasis under DEIS on helping children to make a smooth transition to second level. Initiatives such as familiarisation days and week-long transfer programmes have been shown to have been very successful in that regard. Schools participating in the School Support Programme under DEIS are being encouraged to prioritise the development of effective transfer programmes for pupils making the transition to post-primary education.</p>
            <p eId="para_2372">In terms of achievement at post-primary level, it is important to look at the issue in terms of attainment of second level education or equivalent rather than just school completion. Focusing just on school devalues the hard work of students who continued their education in Youthreach centres, went on to train for apprenticeships through FÁS, or acquired qualifications through other equally valuable routes. The Government is encouraged by data that shows that the attainment levels of our young people have improved significantly in recent years. By 2006, 85.4% of Irish 20 to 24 year olds had obtained upper second level education or equivalent - up from 82.6% in 2000 and significantly ahead of the EU average of 77.8%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2373">The improvement in the proportion of 20-24 year olds with at least second level education or equivalent in recent years is testament to the success of the Government's dual strategy of both improving school completion levels and increasing access to second chance and further education. Further improvements in the availability of second chance education are a priority for us. As the Deputy may be aware, funding has been provided for 400 extra Youthreach places this year. 600 more places are due to be provided by 2009 under the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement.  We are also conscious that the content and perceived relevance of the school curricula have an important effect on students' motivation and desire to finish school. Under the DEIS plan, more students in disadvantaged areas will have access to the Junior Certificate Schools Programme and the Leaving Cert Applied programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">To conclude, there is evidence that the Government's focus on improving school completion rates and attainment levels in recent years is making a difference. I assure the Deputy that further improvements in this area will continue to be a priority for us in the years ahead. Social inclusion measures across other Government departments have also been prioritised under the Towards 2016 agreement, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion and the National Development Plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_2376">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP). DEIS will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2377">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate. The identification process involved a survey of primary schools conducted by the Educational Research Centre in May, 2005 and the updating by them of existing data sources on levels of disadvantage in second-level schools.  Details of the schools included in the School Support Programme under DEIS are in the tables below. They are also available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">The Department has put in place separate arrangements for new and newly amalgamated primary schools established since 2005. The website list of schools in the SSP will be revised shortly to include new and newly amalgamated schools that are identified for inclusion in the programme.</p>

        <b>Deputy Róisín Shortall</b>
         asked the

         the expected number of students, including the percentage increase, to enrol into secondary schools in September 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012; the locations which can expect an increase in pupil enrolment based upon her contact with secondary schools; the provisions being made by the schools to facilitate the increase in students enrolling into secondary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_6559">The information in the format requested by the Deputy is not readily available. The annual total of births in Ireland has been increasing since 1995. As a direct consequence of this, enrolments at Primary level have been increasing since 2001/02 and are projected to continue increasing for the foreseeable future. Inward migration is another factor pushing up enrolment at both primary and second level in recent years together with an underlying increase in participation — especially beyond the compulsory school-leaving age.</p>
            <p eId="para_6560">Taking all factors into account including some further growth in retention, continuing net inward migration and the long-term impact of rising numbers at primary level feeding through to second level, it is expected that total enrolment at second level will resume growth from its current low level of just around 330,000 (projection for 2006/07) to reach about 370,000 in 2015/16.  It will increase further after 2015 as those born in the years of rising births from 1995-2004 will pass through second level in the period coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6561">Of course, the projected growth in enrolment at primary and second level will not be evenly spread across the country. Sharp differences in population growth, and even decline in some areas, are characteristic of many areas of the country.  While the level of teaching resources can be adjusted to changes in enrolment through the staffing schedules in operation at primary and second level hard infrastructure such as buildings and other facilities are more difficult to plan for at a very local level. And where investment takes place it takes time to put these resources in place to meet additional and sometimes unexpected demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_6562">To deal with this increasing demand for school places, the Government is providing funding of €4.5 billion over the lifetime of the new National Development Plan (NDP). This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and it will enable my Department to ensure that school places are available where needed as well as continuing to upgrade existing school facilities. This investment will allow my Department to continue the school building programme which commenced during the life time of the last NDP when well over €2.6 billion was invested in school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_6563">The budget for 2007 is the first year of the roll out of the new NDP. This funding will enable my Department to continue to provide modern school accommodation on an on-going basis, particularly in developing areas. This year alone around over €540 million will be spent on school building infrastructure with over 1,500 projects on my Department's school building programme. Construction in 2007 alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_6566">I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 352 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6567">The process of increasing the number of Irish/EU places in medicine in Ireland commenced in 2006 following the acceptance by the Government of the report entitled "Medical Education in Ireland A new Direction" published jointly by the Department of Health and Children and my Department. The report (the Fottrell Report) called for an increase in medicine places to 725 (from 305) over a four year period. This is being achieved through the provision of an additional 180 undergraduate places, and the introduction of a new programme of graduate entry to medicine which will provide 240 places.  In the 2006/07 academic year, an additional 70 undergraduate places were provided amongst the five medical schools and 40 additional places were provided in the 2007/08 academic year. A further 35 places will be provided in 2008/09 and 2009/10.</p>
            <p eId="para_6568">In addition to increasing the number of undergraduate places, a programme of graduate entry to medicine has commenced in the current academic year with 60 new places created. A further 60 graduate places will be provided in the 2008/09 academic year and the graduate stream will grow to 240 places by 2010/2011.  Generally, it is open to higher education institutions to enrol non-EU students and this is in keeping with the report on the Internationalisation of Irish Education Services accepted by the Government and published in 2004, and the OECD Review of Higher Education published in 2004. It is a matter for institutions to determine the fees charged. I am aware that there will be a reduction in non-Irish/EU medicine places in our medical schools as part of the process of increasing Irish/EU places.</p>
            <p eId="para_6569">I do not propose to comment on a case that is before the courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_6571">I can inform the Deputy that since NEPS was established, we have trebled the number of psychologists in the service. Notwithstanding this and as I have previously announced my Department is committed to increasing psychological service staffing further, so that by 2009 there will be 200 NEPS psychologists.  To this end I can further inform the Deputy that my Department has been working, in conjunction with the Public Appointments Commission to recruit new psychologists from an existing panel to the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_6572">The number of psychologists as of April 2007 stood at 128 including 4 assigned to the National Behavioural Support Service and to the Further Education Service. Since then nine individuals have been appointed in this regard. This advance in numbers has been reduced somewhat by the effects of resignations and retirement and the complement in service currently stands at 134. Three further psychologists are due to join NEPS under this process between now and early January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6573">The panel concerned is now exhausted and the Public Appointments Service has recently announced the commencement of a competition from which a new panel will be drawn to continue the recruitment process. The deadline for receipt of applications in this regard has now passed and work is proceeding on the short-listing of candidates for interview. It is envisaged that the process will be completed and panels formed by the end of next month allowing recruitment to re-commence early in 2008. My Department remains committed to the development of a strong and robust educational psychological service serving the needs of all primary and post-primary pupils.</p>

            <p eId="para_6575">The Department has carried out an extensive study on educational requirements for Swords for the medium to long term.   This study has been formalised and included in the "Draft Area Development Plan for North Dublin, East Meath and South Louth" which was published in January 2007.  The Commission on School Accommodation has completed a public consultation process on foot of this draft Plan and is currently finalising its report which will also be published.  The recommendations in the final Report will be used to inform capital investment decisions in the areas covered including Swords for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p eId="para_6576">There is no doubt that additional post primary places will be needed in the coming years in the area concerned and the Department is already taking action under the Fingal School Model process to ensure that these will be delivered commensurate with the need.  In the meantime, the Department is satisfied that, between them, the four existing post primary schools have adequate provision to cater for current demand.</p>

            <p eId="para_6578">In relation to SSIA income, I want to assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to ensure that SSIA savers are treated fairly in the calculation of reckonable income under my Department's maintenance grant schemes. This is being achieved in two ways: firstly, income from SSIAs is being treated exactly the same as income from similar savings and investment products; and secondly, the reckonable income limits for student grants have been increased considerably in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6579">Since SSIAs were introduced, the amount of income to be included in respect of them is the government grant earned on the savings in the relevant tax year plus, in the case of savings accounts, the gross interest earned in the relevant tax year, and, in the case of investment accounts, the investment profit earned in the relevant tax year. Investment losses sustained in the relevant tax year are deductible.  The same position has long applied to interest earned on other savings products, including deposit accounts, post office savings certificates, life assurance bonds etc. The treatment of SSIAs is therefore consistent with the traditional treatment of other similar investments over many years. The Department of Finance is aware of this approach to the assessment of income for eligibility for student support.</p>
            <p eId="para_6580">So, in applying for a grant for the 2007/08 academic year, only the relevant income earned, as outlined above, on the SSIA in 2006 has to be declared. The maximum that the Government grant to any SSIA saver could have amounted to last year, as in any year of the SSIA scheme, is €762. This has been the position since SSIAs were introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_6581">In relation to the income limits which apply when a person's eligibility for a grant is being assessed, the Deputy will be pleased to know that these have increased significantly since SSIAs were introduced.  The 2003/04 academic year was the first year in which the full year SSIA income had to be included in applying for a grant, as the reference tax year for the purpose of grant assessment was 2002.  For the 2003/04 academic year, the income limit for a family with 4 children was increased from €23,770 to €35,165 – an increase of nearly 48%. The income limits have continued to rise each year, to the point where the limit for a family with 4 children this year is €42,490 – an increase of nearly 79% on the amount allowed in the 2002/03 academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6582">As these increases show, this Government has shown a clear determination to improve the grant system to ensure that students get as much support as possible. But, not only have we increased the income limits significantly, we have also made other improvements to the grants system:</p>
            <p eId="para_6583">We have introduced two new income thresholds to allow for 25% and 75% grants as well as the 50% and 100% rates;</p>
            <p eId="para_6584">We have brought in a new Special Rate of Maintenance Grant to target extra funding at those who need it most; and</p>
            <p eId="para_6585">We have increased grant payment rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_6586">Indeed, the maximum level of the ordinary maintenance grant available this year is €3,420 – compared to €2,390 in 2002.  The maximum level of the Special Rate of Maintenance in 2007/08 is €6,690 — compared to €3,000 in 2001/02.  This year, over €241 million has been allocated for the third level student support schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_6587">The student referred to by the Deputy is in receipt of assistance under the maintenance grant schemes for 2007/08.</p>

            <p eId="para_6589">I am aware of recent public comment in relation to the operation of the CAO system. In my view, the CAO system has been a long standing success of the Irish education system. In addition to its core task to serve as a clearing house for the institutions in the allocation of higher education places to applicants, the CAO has, since its creation, earned a well deserved reputation for integrity and fairness in the conduct of its business, which has served students, institutions and Ireland well.</p>
            <p eId="para_6590">There have been considerable efforts over time to review the operation of the CAO, and the points system which underpin the operation of the CAO, most notably in the Points Commission report of 1999, which considered and rejected the concept of a lottery approach.  However, I am concerned that the points system can, in some cases, lead to undue pressure on students to attain perfect or near perfect performance in the Leaving Certificate in order to gain access to particular third level courses, particularly medicine. I do not believe that is good for students or for the second level system. Accordingly, as part of the Fottrell reforms for medical education which were accepted by the Government, new procedures to reform access to medicine are currently being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_6591">It is planned to introduce the new procedure in 2009. The Programme for Government contains a commitment to evaluate the success of the new alternative entry arrangements for medical education with a view to determining if similar changes should be made in the application procedures for other high-points courses.</p>

            <p eId="para_6609">Examination fees are generally increased each year in line with increases in the consumer price index.  It has not been the practice to hold discussions with the Department of Social and Family Affairs or any other Government agency before setting examination fee levels.  There is an alleviation scheme in place whereby current medical card holders and their dependents are exempt from the payment of examination fees. This exemption applies to approximately 30% of all examination candidates each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_6610">I should point out that the income received from examination fees generally covers only a fraction of the cost of running the examinations. The costs associated with the certificate examinations have been increasing significantly in recent years due to the introduction of new methods of assessment in various subjects and to continuing increases in special arrangements for students with special needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_6612">Based on a constant average annual salary of €60,000 over a forty year teaching career, the cumulative gross salary of a teacher would amount to €2.400 million in today's money. The gross superannuation costs calculated on this same salary on a constant basis over a subsequent 25 year retirement period would amount to €0.840 million inclusive of €90,000 in respect of retirement gratuity. The superannuation costs are those applicable in the case of a person who pays modified class D rate PRSI through out his/her employment and whose occupational pension on retirement is not integrated with social welfare benefits. The corresponding costs in the case of a person who pays full rate, Class A, PRSI and whose benefits are integrated with social welfare benefits would be €2.965 million, comprising €2.400 million salary and €0.565 million superannuation inclusive of €90,000 in respect of retirement gratuity.</p>

            <p eId="para_6624">The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department. However, if the Deputy wishes to request details on a specific school, my officials will provide the required information. The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_6625">The focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary/prefabricated accommodation at primary level and to upgrade existing facilities, two new initiatives, the Permanent Accommodation Initiative and the Small School Initiative were launched in 2003 on a pilot basis. The purpose of these initiatives was to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money as opposed to the provision of temporary accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_6626">The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased year on year and many schools are anxious to be included. In order to maintain this momentum I approved over 250 additional schools to participate in these schemes in 2007. As a result of these schemes the amount spent on the purchase of prefabricated buildings has been significantly reduced.</p>

            <p eId="para_6845">As the Deputy will be aware the decision whether to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved.  Data on flood risk is provided to insurers by private companies and the use of such information is a matter for the company concerned in determining whether any particular risk should be underwritten. The representative body for the Insurance industry in Ireland has however indicated to my Department that insurers would seek to continue to provide insurance cover to customers in circumstances where the risk of flooding has increased, but the change in risk would need to be reflected in the terms on which the insurance was offered. It also indicated that it was not aware of specific instances where insurance cover was refused where no history of flooding existed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6846">The Financial Regulator has no role in relation to issues of pricing or the scope of cover provided by insurance companies. However, an individual, in dealing with an insurance provider can refer any unresolved complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman for investigation and adjudication. My Department has also been advised by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that as regards planning and flood risk, the Planning and Development Act 2000 states that planning authorities may include in their development plans objectives regulating, restricting or controlling development in areas at risk from flooding. Where development is proposed in an area at risk from flooding, it is a matter for each planning authority to evaluate such risk on the basis of a flood risk assessment, where appropriate.  In addition, planning permission may either be refused, or, if granted, can be made subject to conditions requiring the implementation of measures necessary to alleviate or avoid damage due to flooding.</p>

            <p eId="para_6848">It is assumed that the Deputy's Question refers to data displayed on the Office of Public Work's website floodmaps.ie.  At present there is not extensive national flood plain mapping. In 2004 the Government designated the OPW as lead agency for flood risk management. The OPW is currently implementing a comprehensive strategy that includes a programme to develop predictive maps that will indicate areas expected to be at risk from flooding for flood events of varying severities. A European Union Directive that will enter into force this month will require that Member States produce this type of mapping for all River basins where there is significant flood risk. A number of sophisticated techniques, including hydraulic modelling will be used. While it will take a number of years to complete the predictive mapping programme, maps for the first catchments completed will be available on the website in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6849">In preparation for the predictive mapping programme, the OPW collected from various state organisations and other sources reports, newspaper articles and other records in relation to areas that flooded in the past. The material was checked to establish as far as possible the accuracy of the information and the approximate location of the flood event recorded. The material was presented on the floodmaps.ie website in 2006 as a guide to members of the public and planners pending the development of predictive maps.</p>
            <p eId="para_6850">Due to lack of information in some of the source material, it is pointed out on the website that the location indicated for flood events is approximate only. Users of the website are invited to forward additional flood related material they may have or to query items already displayed on it. If the Deputy will provide my Office with further details of the information relating to Lucan that is believed to be incorrect I will have the matter examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_6855">The position is that the PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis. The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_6856">There have been changes since 1980 — the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis, for example. However, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit. Moreover, given that there can be significant timing advantages in the payment of tax for the self employed, the employee credit is still perceived as necessary to ensure a balance in the system.  The cost to the Exchequer of extending the PAYE credit to farmers and the self employed, including proprietary directors, is estimated at €610 million in a full year.  The cost of abolishing the PAYE credit and increasing the personal credit by the same amount is estimated at €750 million in a full year.  The additional cost would arise because the personal credit is transferable between spouses.</p>
            <p eId="para_6857">It should be borne in mind that there is already in place a generous package of reliefs and specific arrangements that continue to be available exclusively to the farming sector. These include income averaging;  stock relief; accelerated capital allowances for expenditure incurred on farm buildings; accelerated capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on certain pollution control measures; capital allowances in respect of expenditure incurred on the purchase of milk quota; an exemption from income tax in respect of certain income from certain leased farmland and special tax treatment in respect of profits accruing as a result of the disposal of stock under statutory disease eradication measures. In addition, certain young trained farmers can also qualify for full relief from Stamp Duty on the transfer of land and can also avail of enhanced stock relief of 100 per cent.</p>

            <p eId="para_6859">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that provision already exists for a limited scheme of tax relief in respect of expenditure incurred on the treatment of trade effluent and the supply of water. The scheme operates in conjunction with local authorities. It caters for a situation where, for the purposes of his or her trade, a person contributes a capital sum towards expenditure incurred by a local authority on an asset to be used for trade effluent control purposes or for the provision of water supply. Capital allowances may be claimed in respect of any such capital sums contributed, with amounts contributed being written off over eight years at the rate of 12.5% per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_6860">I am also informed that, in the farming area, capital allowances are available for capital expenditure incurred on the construction of certain buildings or structures for the control of farm pollution. These include waste storage facilities including slurry tanks, soiled water tanks and effluent tanks. The scheme applies only to farmers who have put in place a farm nutrient management plan drawn up by an agency or planner approved by the Department of Agriculture and Food. For expenditure incurred on or after 1 January 2005 allowances can be claimed over 3 years with the expenditure being written off at the rate of 33 1/3% per annum.  There are no plans for the introduction of further tax incentive schemes in this area.</p>

         his views on reviewing the vehicle registration tax being charged for personnel currently involved in the taxi industry who buy a wheelchair accessible taxi in view of the costs involved in terms of converting a normal taxi to a wheelchair accessible taxi and the fact that in recent years the number of wheelchair accessible taxis has reduced rapidly; if he will consider this proposal as a means of encouraging the number of wheelchair accessible taxis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6876">I have no plans to reduce or eliminate VRT on taxis.  In this regard, it should be recognised that tax reliefs have proved at times to be a blunt, inflexible and expensive means of providing assistance and achieving policy aims which might be more effectively achieved through regulatory or direct expenditure means. VRT on vehicles helps to broaden the tax base and provides an important source of Exchequer revenue. I am asked regularly to introduce tax reliefs for one purpose or another, but to accede to all such requests would lead to an immediate narrowing of the tax base.</p>

            <p eId="para_6934">The position is that the VAT treatment of goods and services is governed by EU law with which Irish VAT law must comply. The rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the status of the customer. There is no provision in European VAT law that would allow the application of an exemption or reduction of VAT on supplies of goods or services to customers over a certain age.</p>
            <p eId="para_6935">However, the Deputy may be aware that local authorities already provide grants to assist in the provision and adaptation of accommodation to meet the needs of the elderly and people with a disability. These grants cover such works as access ramps, stairlifts, installation of downstairs toilet facilities, accessible bathrooms and extensions. In addition, the Housing Aid for Older People Grant Scheme implements the Government decision to transfer the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme from the HSE to the Local Authority sector by amalgamating it with the Essential Repairs Grant Scheme. The aim of the scheme is to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have essential repairs or improvements carried out. The maximum grant under this scheme is €10,500 and may cover 100% of the approved cost of the works for applicants with an annual household income of less than €30,000 tapering to 30% for those with annual household incomes of between €54,001 to €65,000. This grant covers such works as structural repairs, rewiring, replacement of doors and windows, provision of water and sanitary services, and other repair or improvement works which are considered essential.</p>

It was announced in the 2003 Budget that no roll-over relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than current levels.  The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low.</p>
            <p eId="para_6940">As the Deputy will be aware, there is already in place a generous package of reliefs that continue to be available to the farming sector.  As you will also be aware, it is a long standing tradition that the Minister for Finance does not comment on taxation matters in advance of the annual Budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_6946">I have noted the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service regarding the time limit for claiming refunds of overpaid tax. My predecessor as Minister for Finance examined the whole question of taxpayers' entitlement to repayment of tax and interest with a view to introducing, in so far as practicable, a uniform scheme which was fair and reasonable for taxpayers, and which also took into account the position of the Exchequer.  On foot of that review, a new provision was introduced in Finance Act, 2003 (Section 17) which for the first time gave taxpayers a general right to repayment of tax overpaid subject to a 4 year claim limitation period. This became effective for all claims received on or after 01 January 2005.  At the same time the right of the Revenue Commissioners to raise assessments and make enquiries was also reduced to a 4 year period, apart from cases where fraud or neglect is suspected. The scheme was devised after careful and detailed consideration.  It was designed to achieve the necessary balance between establishing a fair and uniform system for taxpayers, while, at the same time, providing the necessary protection for the Exchequer from exposure to claims going back many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6947">Overall, I am satisfied that the current provision is both fair and reasonable and I have no plans to amend the legislation in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_6953">The position is that the VAT ratings of all goods and services are subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Under the VAT Directive Member States may apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed in Annex III of the Directive.  In addition, Member States may retain a reduced VAT rate for goods and services to which a reduced VAT rate applied on 1 January 1991 (the so called "parked rates").  Under the Sixth Schedule to the Value-Added Tax Act 1972, the supply of photographic prints, slides or negatives is subject to the reduced rate of VAT of 13.5%.  Since this measure was introduced in 1987 prior to 1 January 1991, Ireland is allowed to maintain its treatment of such products.</p>
            <p eId="para_6954">However, digitised photographs were not included as a category of good that could be subject to the reduced rate as applied on 1 January 1991, nor are they included in Annex III of the VAT Directive. It is therefore not possible for Ireland to extend the reduced rate to photography on disk. Thus, photographs, etc on disk are subject to the standard rate of VAT of 21 per cent.</p>

            <p eId="para_6956">The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States. In the Irish context, these derogations allowed for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services.</p>
            <p eId="para_6957">While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, who are the deciding authority, have to date refused all such requests.  The Commission maintain that, in keeping with the EU Energy Tax Directive, Member States must apply at least the EU minimum rates of excise on fuels in such circumstances and that any further favourable excise treatment is not allowable. At the Commission's behest my officials have indicated that Ireland will avail of the forthcoming Finance Bill to make the necessary legislative changes to conform with the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_6958">In the circumstances, the relevant line Departments are exploring, in conjunction with my Department, alternative non-tax support mechanisms that could be put in place where appropriate to maintain the assistance currently being provided subject of course to compatibility with EU State Aid requirements.

            <p eId="para_7001">The minimum wage in 2006 was €7.65 per hour. On an annualised basis, this is equivalent to €15,514.20 assuming a 39 hour working week.  In 2006 the entry point to income tax under the PAYE system was €15,600 per annum for a single person under 65.  The current minimum wage is €8.65 per hour. On an annualised basis, this is equivalent to €17,542.20 assuming a 39 hour working week.</p>
            <p eId="para_7002">The present entry point to income tax under the PAYE system is €17,600 per annum for a single person under 65.  The position is, therefore, that an employee earning the minimum wage who benefits from entitlement to the employee (PAYE) tax credit in addition to the basic personal tax credit would not pay income tax in 2006 or 2007.  The number of PAYE income earners earning the equivalent of the minimum wage in its annualised form or less, who paid no income tax is estimated 556,000 and 619,000 for 2006 and 2007, respectively. These figures do not take into account those earners who earned the applicable minimum wage rate, which is an hourly rate, but who, through overtime working or bonus payments would have earned more than the minimum wage in its annualised form.  The figures are provisional and likely to be revised.  It should be noted that a married couple that has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</p>

            <p eId="para_7004">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant information available is the amount of tax revenues collected as Mineral Oil Tax (excise) and VRT in respect of motor vehicles. The information furnished with VAT returns does not require the yield from a particular sector or sub-sector of trade to be identified. However, the estimated receipts of VAT from cars and motor fuels are included in the attached schedule.</p>

            <p eId="para_7372">The Group in question applied for interim support funding under the NCIP and were declined in September 2007 as their application had not demonstrated sufficient ability to efficiently manage and sustain the service from September 2007 and therefore did not meet the requirements of the NCIP interim support scheme.  The Group was invited to contact their local City/County Childcare Committee should they wish to apply for funding under the new Community Childcare Subvention Scheme which will come into effect in January 2008.  I understand that the Group requested a review of this decision and will be informed of the outcome shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_7373">The interim support scheme under the NCIP was introduced as an interim measure pending the introduction of the new Community Childcare Subvention Scheme, to facilitate Groups which were unable to meet the contractual deadline of December 2006 for funding under the EOCP staffing support scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_7383">I propose to take Questions Nos. 137, 191 and 198 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7384">My Department understands that the Health Service Executive (HSE) has not received formal notification from any community pharmacist regarding cessation of services under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  I have previously outlined in detail to the Oireachtas the legal provisions under competition law which prevent the HSE from negotiating with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU) on fees, prices or margins for their members. When it became clear that the HSE could not negotiate with pharmacists or wholesalers on fees or margins, a detailed, fair and transparent consultation process, including independent economic analysis and public consultation, was carried out to inform the final determination of the new reimbursement pricing arrangements for drugs and medicines under the GMS and community drugs schemes. These new arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17th September 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_7385">To address concerns expressed by the IPU, on behalf of community pharmacists, about the implications of the legal advice on competition law on their right to negotiate fees through the Union, a process of dialogue was established, chaired by Bill Shipsey SC, to explore ways in which concerns raised by the IPU about the implications of this legal advice might be addressed.  Despite suspension of this process during the recent withdrawal by individual pharmacists of methadone services, there has recently been renewed engagement between the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE under the auspices of Mr. Shipsey.</p>
            <p eId="para_7386">In regard to the new reimbursement prices, the main wholesaler companies have confirmed to the HSE that they will charge community pharmacists the same price for these drugs and medicines as pharmacists will be reimbursed by the HSE for these products. Furthermore, there are no changes planned by the HSE to the operation of the GMS medical card and community drugs schemes, and all patients continue to receive their entitlements in the normal way.</p>

            <p eId="para_7390">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  Persons aged 70 and over are statutorily entitled to a medical card, regardless of income. In all other cases an assessment of means is undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_7391">Since the beginning of 2005 I have introduced a number of significant changes to the manner in which the assessment for medical cards and GP visit cards is undertaken.  The assessment guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29%.  Applications are now considered on the basis of income net of tax and PRSI and allowance is made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work.  In June 2006, I agreed with the Health Service Executive (HSE) a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those used in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_7392">The Programme for Government commits to the following: Indexing the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage; Implementation of an annual publicity campaign and making applications easier so as to increase uptake amongst those who are eligible for Medical Cards and GP Visit Cards; Doubling of the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and trebling them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability; Allowing people with disabilities to work without losing key essential medical card cover after 3 years. My Department is at present considering the steps required to enable these commitments to be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_7393">My Department is also examining the steps necessary to give effect to the Towards 2016 commitment to review the eligibility criteria for the assessment of medical cards in the context of medical, social and economic/financial need with a view to clarifying entitlement to a medical card.  I attach a table showing medical card assessment guidelines increases over the past 5 years.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_7426">I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7427">As the Deputy will be aware, my Office has responsibility for the Early Childcare Supplement (ECS), which is paid in respect of all children under the age of 6 who are qualified for Child Benefit.  This payment is administered on behalf of my Office on an agency basis by the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs, which has provided me with the figures in the following tables.  This payment and Child Benefit are the universal supports to all parents, which assist them with their child care costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7428">It may be noted that at current levels, payments are made under EU Regulations in respect of 885 non-resident children, which costs €221,250 per quarter, and payments are made in respect of 411,947 children resident in the State which costs €106,308,358.  This means that 0.2% of payments are in respect of non-resident children, and I am informed that nearly half of those children are resident in Northern Ireland.  However there is a significant number of Child Benefit claims on hand which are subject to EU Regulations and, when these are processed, the cost of payments in respect of such children may give rise to a slight increase in the total figure for Child Benefit, depending on the outcome of those applications, with a similar proportion arising in respect of the ECS.</p>
            <p eId="para_7429">The tables contain the data regarding the numbers of resident and non-resident children and the cost per quarter since introduction of the ECS.  It should be noted that the "Cost" is the total paid in that quarter and "children paid" refers to the number of children in payment at the end of each quarter and does not reflect those paid arrears during the quarter.</p>

            <p eId="para_7484">If the individual in question is considering nursing home care, then she should be made aware that the Minister announced a new Nursing Home Support Scheme — A Fair Deal — on 11 December 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_7485">The proposed new scheme aims to remedy the inequities that exist in the current system. At present, people face greatly different costs depending on whether they are in public or private nursing homes. In addition, individual contributions in public places are based on a flat rate regardless of an individual's wealth, whereas State support for individuals in private places is based on means-testing. This means that many people in private nursing homes get no support, and even with subvention, people can face costs they cannot afford. The result is that some people are forced to sell or mortgage their homes to pay for care costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_7486">In contrast, the new Nursing Home Support Scheme will ensure that long-term residential care is affordable for all who need it. Contributions during a person's life will be affordable and they will not have to sell or mortgage their house to meet the contribution. Furthermore, a person's family will not have to contribute towards the cost of their care.  Under the new Nursing Home Support Scheme, people who require long-term residential care will contribute up to 80% of their assessable income, whether for public or private nursing home care. Depending on the amount of a person's assessable income, there will also be a contribution of up to 5% of a person's assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_7487">The portion of the contribution relating to assets, such as a person's house, may be deferred. This means that it does not have to be met during the person's lifetime and can be payable on settlement of the person's estate instead. The deferred contribution will be based on the actual number of weeks spent in residential care and on the cost of care and, consequently, may be less than 5% per annum. I would take this opportunity to emphasise that no one will pay more than the cost of their care.</p>
            <p eId="para_7488">In addition, where the deferred contribution applies to the principal private residence, it will be capped at a maximum of 15%, or 7.5% in the case of one spouse remaining in the home while the other enters long-term residential care. This means that after three years in care, a person will not be liable for any further deferred charge on the principal residence. It also means that 85% of the value of the principal residence will be maintained for the beneficiaries of the person's estate. This is not something that can be guaranteed at the moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_7489">A person or his/her family can also choose to pay the charge at the time when care is being received instead of allowing it to be levied upon the estate if they so wish.  Where a spouse or certain dependants are living in the principal residence, the charge can be further deferred until after the death of that spouse or dependant or until such time as a person previously qualifying as a dependant ceases to qualify as such.</p>
            <p eId="para_7490">The Department is currently preparing a Bill for the new Nursing Home Support Scheme. It is intended to publish the Bill for the scheme in November, and to have the legislation in place by 1 January 2008.  The Health Service Executive will have responsibility for the administration and operation of the scheme. Accordingly, I would advise the individual in question to contact her local HSE Office that deals with nursing home queries. They are based in St. Mary's Hospital, Phoenix Park, Dublin 20. The phone number is 01-6778132.</p>

            <p eId="para_7579">The consensus of scientific opinion to date regarding possible adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields (EMF) exposure from mobile phone masts is that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between such exposure and ill health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has assessed the many reviews carried out in this area and has indicated that exposures below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in their 1998 Guidelines do not produce any known adverse health effects. These guidelines are based on a careful analysis of all peer-reviewed scientific literature and include thermal and non-thermal effects.</p>
            <p eId="para_7580">In 1999, the European Community introduced recommendations on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, based on the ICNIRP guidelines.

            <p eId="para_7596">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_7597">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_7598">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Noel Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_7704">I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 to 216, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7705">I think it is important to put the relevant decisions in context and to assure the Deputy that these decisions have been taken against a background of increased focus on, and support for, the maritime safety sector. It is my intention that the Irish Coast Guard and Maritime Administration will be strengthened on an ongoing basis over the coming years. My ambition is to put in place a service which will meet the needs of this country well in the 21st century.</p>
            <p eId="para_7706">The communications system is the backbone infrastructure on which Coast Guard operations depend. It is essential that it is of high quality, efficient, effective and that it provides value for money.  I am concerned at the state of the present equipment and have confirmed that a €2 million investment in essential equipment should proceed without any further delay. I have also confirmed that this equipment should be sufficient to operate two fully manned Co-Ordination centres. Each centre will have the capability to run the entire Coast Guard network which will allow for a seamless transfer of co-ordination should one centre become suddenly unworkable for any reason. I have also confirmed that locating one on the east coast and one on the west coast is the preferred option and that the east coast centre should be co-located with the HQ. These decisions were made against the background of a study completed by Deloitte and Touche in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_7707">In relation to the west coast I consider that the site should provide a technically robust location and also be situated where all the staff at the centre can live within close proximity to enable them to be called on in an emergency. I have not decided where that location should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_7708">I purposely outlined the long-term scenario on this basis to provide a framework for negotiations, which are now taking place, on how best to implement this particular step in the modernisation of the Irish Coast Guard. I have given direction to the tendering process so that it can proceed, and given enough notice to enable difficulties to be identified and resolved before equipment has to be installed. I have made it clear that these discussions, which are underway, must take account of the safety needs of local communities, and ongoing improvement of the service to the public, and the concerns of individual staff members.</p>
            <p eId="para_7709">In relation to staff, I also want to restate my deeply held appreciation of the work done by those working in these centres today. I do not want to, nor do I intend to lose the emergency management expertise that has been developed and indeed I am determined to ensure that it is retained for future generations.  At an individual level, no one will lose their job in this process. Nor will they be forced to move to new locations. This presents challenges, as it does in the decentralisation programme, but they are challenges that are being discussed with the staff involved and that will be overcome in consultation with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_7710">The issue was discussed at a meeting of the Marine Emergency Advisory Group, which is a strategic high level advisory group, and will be discussed further with representatives of national and neighbouring marine search and rescue stakeholders in the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee next month. I note the point made by the Deputy in relation to consultation with other local services who might have an interest in using the Coast Guard locations in the future and will explore this particular aspect. However, neither location has ready access to the sea and this may be a limiting factor.</p>
            <p eId="para_7711">The Irish Coast Guard has no responsibility for drug and crime prevention and fisheries protection, at present.  In relation to international bodies providing similar services, while it is technically feasible to operate these services from outside the country, my preference is for both locations to be on this island. It would be my intention that where we can provide support to others internationally we should be in a position to do so and indeed I consider that this is likely to be an increasingly important role for Ireland in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_7713">Transport 21 provides for the development of a Luas line from St Stephen's Green to Liffey Junction, using the old Broadstone railway alignment. This is consistent with the long-term transportation strategy for the Greater Dublin Area in the "Dublin Transportation Initiative" (1995) and in the Dublin Transportation Office's strategy "A Platform for Change" (2001), both of which envisaged the old Broadstone alignment being used for Luas or Metro Services.</p>

            <p eId="para_7717">From January 2006 to October 2007, total Exchequer expenditure on Transport 21 projects was €3,476.4 million.  Transport 21 is a ten-year financial framework that identifies a number of key transport projects to be completed in each of the years from 2006 to 2015. Significant progress has been made in all of the sectors covered by the framework and all of the implementing agencies are now geared up to deliver on the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7718">All of the major projects included in Transport 21 are being progressed and are at various stages of the planning and implementation process. A number of projects have already been completed, others are at various stages of construction, some have begun the statutory planning process while many more are at design, planning and public consultation stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_7720">The planning, design and construction of the Interconnector is a matter for Iarnród Éireann. Transport 21 provides for the completion of the Interconnector by 2015. I understand that the feasibility and planning design studies currently being undertaken by Iarnród Éireann and its consultants are due for completion shortly. As part of this work Iarnród Éireann undertook public consultation in relation to the project on 3rd and 4th July this year. Iarnród Éireann is also liaising with the RPA over matters relating to the key interchanges between the Interconnector and Luas and Metro and with Dublin City Council regarding traffic management matters during the building programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_7725">The current position regarding the delivery of the 183 new intercity railcars is that Iarnród Éireann has taken delivery of 60 of the cars. They are currently undergoing commissioning and the first batch will be introduced into service on the Dublin-Sligo route over the coming months.  The remainder of the new fleet will be delivered and brought into service by the Spring of 2009.  None of these railcars will be used on DART or North Dublin commuter services but commuter trains currently deployed on the Sligo line will, I understand, when replaced by the new railcars, be used on Dublin commuter services.  I understand that Iarnród Éireann are considering the purchase of additional rolling stock for Dublin commuter services in the context of the electrification of the Maynooth and Northern lines.</p>

            <p eId="para_7738">The capacity and frequency of services on the Maynooth line have been substantially increased in recent years due to the doubling of the track and the provision of additional rolling stock.  The opening of the Docklands station has also benefitted passengers on the line with additional services from Clonsilla to Docklands.  Services will be further improved when the remaining peak period services operating with 4 carriages on the Dublin-Maynooth line are extended to 8 carriages during 2008.  This will be made possible by the re-allocation of commuter railcars currently in use on the Sligo line. New intercity railcars are being introduced over the coming months on the Sligo line.</p>
            <p eId="para_7739">I understand from Irish Rail that it is currently reviewing its plans for re-signalling in the city centre area as part of its broader plans for the upgrade of railway infrastructure in the Dublin area. In this context, it is considering the removal of level crossings and re-signalling the Maynooth line as a means of substantially increasing capacity on the line.  The project is expected to be completed in 2011.  The management and development of car parks is a matter for Irish Rail.</p>

            <p eId="para_7804">Transport 21 provides for the development of a Luas line from St Stephen's Green to Liffey Junction, using the old Broadstone railway alignment.  The Board of the RPA decided earlier this year on a preferred route option for the cross-city on-street element of this Luas line and the RPA are now planning detailed design work on the project based on this option.  Dublin City Council is undertaking traffic modelling work as part of its examination of revised traffic management arrangements in the city, which will be required not only for the delivery of the cross-city Luas line but also Metro North.  In this context, the RPA is also considering ways of streamlining and combining works on the cross-city Luas Line and the construction of Metro North in order to minimise disruption to the City Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_7805">Following completion of design work, consideration of combining work on both projects, and subject to a satisfactory outcome to the city centre traffic management planning work, the RPA will submit a Railway Order application to An Bord Pleanála.

            <p eId="para_7811">All drivers are subject to road traffic law and it is a matter for An Garda Síochána to enforce the law.  Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006 (Conferral of Functions) Order 2006 (S.I. No. 477 of 2006) the Road Safety Authority has responsibility for ensuring that penalty points are endorsed on a licence record. Data in relation to penalty points is held on the National Driver File.

The first issue of a Transport 21 Newsletter was recently published.  The printing cost was €1,795.  Significant progress has been made to date on Transport 21.  Major projects, particularly on the national road network, are being brought in on time and on budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_7815">All of the seven national road projects opened to date this year have been on time, including the Newry- Dundalk motorway which opened three months ahead of schedule, the Tyrellspass to Kilbeggan project which was six months ahead of schedule, and phase 1 of the Arklow- Gorey Bypass which opened 4 months ahead of schedule.  The inter-urban motorway programme is on target to be completed by the end of 2010 and the final section of the M1 Dublin-Border motorway opened recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_7816">There has also been considerable progress in public transport sector.  Construction has begun on a number of important rail projects, including the first phase of the Western Rail Corridor and the Kildare route upgrade. Two Luas projects also started — the extension to Cherrywood and Docklands. The Docklands station in Dublin opened last March two years ahead of target.  New rolling stock is being introduced on the railways. The benefits of this can be seen in the hourly service introduced on the Dublin-Cork route at the start of the year and will be seen on other intercity routes as the new railcars enter service. Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann are putting additional buses into service, improving the level of service.  Pier D in Dublin Airport opened earlier this week on time and within budget — the cost was 20% less than the cost of comparable international facilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_7978">The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards provide a source of support to small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants.  All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects, which should generally be in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector, have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.</p>
            <p eId="para_7979">Enterprise Ireland provides funding and expertise to companies with ten or more employees in the indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors who wish to expand through increased export activity.

            <p eId="para_7980">EI Clients must be Irish owned, be a manufacturing or an internationally trading services enterprise or be an overseas company in the food, drink and timber sectors seeking assistance to locate in Ireland, must employ more than 10 people or be a high growth start-up according to criteria defined by the Board of EI.  In addition Enterprise Ireland must be satisfied that the company will: produce products for sale primarily in world markets; produce products of an advanced technological nature for supply to internationally trading or skilled sub-supply firms within the State; and produce products for sectors of the Irish market which are subject to international competition or is a service industry, as defined by relevant ministerial order.</p>

            <p eId="para_8020">The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.  In 2006, provisional sports capital allocations totalling €91,835,997 were made to 859 separate projects.  The allocation in the subhead for that year was €60,053,000 including an amount carried over from 2005 of €5,000,000.  In 2007, provisional sports capital allocations totalling €85,000,000 have been made to 935 separate projects.  The allocation in the subhead for this year is €63,092,000 including an amount carried over from 2006 of €13,842,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_8022">Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by my Department, grant aid is provided to local authorities towards the capital costs of a new or replacement public swimming pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool provided by local authorities themselves or by other bodies where the application for capital funding is supported by the local authority.  Under the Programme there are four stages in a swimming pool project.  These, in order of progress, are: Feasibility Study/Preliminary Report; Contract Documents; Tender and Construction.  Local authorities may not proceed to the next stage of a project until prior approval issues from my Department.  Grant aid is only formally allocated when the tender is approved.  The Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works (OPW), evaluates each stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_8023">The current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme closed to new applications on 31 July 2000 and the priority is to continue to support those projects remaining within the programme.  Of the 57 projects within the current round, 42 projects have been formally allocated grant aid, of which 28 have been completed and 14 are under construction or about to start construction.  4 projects are out to tender and the remaining 11 are at earlier stages in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_8024">On the basis that all of the projects currently within the programme proceed to completion and if each receives the maximum grant of €3.8m, a total amount of some €85m will be required to complete this round.  In 2007, the Subhead provision for this programme is €25m and this amount is expected to be drawn down by grantees by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8025">On 25 October last, in response to a Priority Question from the Deputy, I agreed to check out the position in relation to funding for the programme under the National Development Plan.  As I indicated in my reply, there is a provision of €184m in the National Development Plan, 2007-2013 in respect of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  This provision is to meet costs associated with the existing programme and the commencement of a new programme. Because of the long lead time involved in the development of a public swimming pool project, the need to give priority to and maintain activity on those projects within the current round, funding must be planned on a multi-annual basis.  When the next round of the programme is launched, there will be sufficient funding available to finish projects within the current round and grant aid new projects under the next round.  However, as the programme is application based, financial demand on a year-to-year basis can be difficult to assess.  However, I would point out that the priority which attaches to this programme can be gauged from the fact that since the current round of the programme began in 2000, the full grant aid requirements of the programme have been met in full each year.</p>

            <p eId="para_8027">There will be significant enhancement in the coming years in the cultural institutions in Dublin City.  My Department is currently engaged in projects to develop the existing National Cultural Institutions in the City.  Within the framework of the National Development Plan 2007-2013, funding is being allocated for the construction of a Centre Block at the Collins Barracks premises of the National Museum of Ireland.  The development of the Centre Block will be a major extension of the facilities at Collins Barracks and the proposal is that it will include major new exhibitions and will also display the historic vessel, the Asgard, upon completion of the programme for its conservation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8028">A major redevelopment of the Natural History Museum in Merrion Street is also to be undertaken which will upgrade the Museum's facilities and will address accessibility issues.  The funding in the National Development Plan will also provide for a programme for the enhancement of facilities of the Irish Museum of Modern Art in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, the National Library of Ireland, the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Concert Hall and the Abbey Theatre.</p>
            <p eId="para_8029">The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish a Museum of Irish Literature in Parnell Square and this is currently being progressed by Dublin City Council in consultation with my Department.  It also contains a commitment to establish a National Sports Museum and locating it in the National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks is being progressed at present.  Furthermore, the Programme for Government contains commitments regarding the establishment of the GPO as a museum of celebration of Irish progress and achievement across a broad spectrum as a landmark 1916 centenary project, and the restoration of 16 Moore Street and the establishment therein of an interpretative centre to honour those who fought in the 1916 Rising.  These latter projects are also being progressed.</p>

Contact between the owners and the Irish Film Board is ongoing.  The availability of adequate, fully equipped studio resources that can cater for the needs of indigenous and incoming film/TV productions is, however, a key factor in the Irish Film Board's role of marketing Ireland as a film location.  The Irish Film Board is currently reviewing all the available options in relation to studio facilities in Ireland and will be reporting to my Department in early course.</p>

            <p eId="para_8035">The position is that under the Sports Capital Programme, grantees in receipt of funding over a specified level must enter into a Deed of Covenant and Charge in order to protect the Minister's interest and ensure that the property remains in sporting use.  This places a charge on the grantee's property and in this regard, my Department is advised by the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CCSO) that a lease of twenty-one years is required in law to create a legal estate capable of supporting a charge.  However, where a lease is required to be registered in the Property Registration Authority, and a solicitor fails to register the lease in time and part of the twenty-one year term then expires, the Property Registration Authority will not register the lease, and the charge that is required cannot be secured.</p>
            <p eId="para_8036">It is to ensure, therefore, that the lease may be registered within the timeframe required, so that the charge can be secured, that my Department, acting on the advice of the CSSO, has requested a lease of not less than twenty-two years.  In this regard, it provides a safeguard for organisations that apply for capital funding under the Sports Capital Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8037">These stipulations apply to new unregistered leases only, as existing registered leases of twenty-one years or more are capable of supporting a charge.  In such instances, the applicant must provide evidence that the lease has been registered with the Property Registration Authority with a minimum of 15 years remaining.</p>

            <p eId="para_8039">The State pension (non-contributory) is a social assistance scheme and, in common with all other such schemes, features a means test.  In assessing eligibility for social assistance payments, the means test is based on household income.  This is to ensure that resources committed to social assistance payments are used to provide support and improve the position of those who are most in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_8040">The effectiveness of the means testing arrangements is kept under review and in this context, the new enhanced State pension (non-contributory) introduced in September 2006 features significant improvements in the means test.  When the new scheme was introduced, the basic means disregard increased from €7.60 per week to €20 per week, benefiting some 34,000 pensioners on reduced rates.  The means disregard was further increased to €30 per week in Budget 2007 resulting in increased payments for some 26,000 pensioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_8041">The improved disregards are of particular benefit to those without a contributory pension entitlement who are receiving pensions from other jurisdictions.  In this regard, there are about 11,400 British Retirement Pensioners in receipt of State pension (non-contributory) with some 2,250 of these qualifying for the maximum rate.  Means testing arrangements will be kept under review and changes considered where appropriate.</p>

            <p eId="para_8094">I propose to take Questions Nos. 279 and 286 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8095">The income limits for the BSCFA scheme for 2007 are based on the maximum rate of state pension (contributory) (under 80), plus the qualified adult allowance, plus €100 in the case of married and cohabiting couples; and the maximum rate of widow's/widower's contributory pension (under 80) plus €100 for Lone Parents, plus child dependant allowance in each case.  Income Limits for 2007 are €470.80 for a couple with one child and €331.30 for a lone parent with one child.</p>
            <p eId="para_8096">The limit is increased by €22.00 for each qualifying child.  In line with other secondary benefits, a means test is applied to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.  Apart from a number of exceptions, all household income, including welfare payments is assessable as means under the BSCFA scheme in accordance with the normal assessment for supplementary welfare allowance.  The exceptions to these rules are that any income received in the form of family income supplement (FIS), higher level education grants or the first €120 earnings from employment of a rehabilitative nature is disregarded for the purposes of the BSCFA scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8097">A ‘secondary' income limit for BSCFA applied to those who did not qualify on standard means grounds but who satisfied all other conditions and were eligible to receive BSCFA if their gross household income did not exceed €317.43 per week.  This limit of €317.43 was used in situations where applicants were on designated back to work or education schemes or other employment initiatives.  The value of this secondary limit has been eroded progressively by the passage of time and the limit of is being phased out for entitlement to BSCFA.</p>
            <p eId="para_8098">It is not possible to accurately project the impact of removing the old limit of €317.43, or increasing this limit to €400.00 on expenditure on the BSCFA.  The additional numbers qualifying would depend on the number of hours worked, if any, for each individual applicant, the training course or employment initiative being undertaken, any additional household income or means, and also the social welfare or health service payment of the applicant.  Estimated calculations, based on projected income limit increases, have shown that somewhere in the order of an additional 1,000 people would qualify for BSCFA by raising the minimum income limits by €20.00.  This would increase the annual expenditure on the scheme by €0.5m.</p>
            <p eId="para_8099">I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  The main BSCFA income limits have increased over recent years and as the limits are aligned to pension payments they are automatically indexed upward each year with budget increases.  Any further improvements to the scheme would have to be considered in the light of resources available in Budget 2008 for improvements in social welfare payments generally. .</p>

            <p eId="para_8101">Jobseeker's benefit is an insurance based payment and the daily income disregard does not apply to this scheme.  I presume the Deputy is inquiring about jobseeker's allowance and farm assist which are means tested payments where casual worker's earnings are assessed with a daily income disregard of €20. There are approximately 5,800 casual workers in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.  To increase the daily earnings disregard for these workers would cost some €2.7m.</p>
            <p eId="para_8102">This income disregard was increased last September as a result of changes introduced in Budget 2007.  Previously there was a daily income disregard of €12.70 for casual workers, which did not apply to workers with qualified children.  The new arrangements extended this disregard to all casual workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_8103">The daily earnings disregard of €20 was also extended to the spouse or partner of a recipient of jobseeker's allowance, pre-retirement allowance, farm assist and disability allowance.  This significantly simplified and streamlined the assessment of means from earnings for this group.  It is not currently possible to estimate the cost of increasing the disregard for this group as my department is in the process of reviewing the means assessment for these recipients.  When this review is completed I will be in a position to give an estimated cost for this proposed increase.</p>

            <p eId="para_8108">It is not possible to estimate the cost of reducing the required minimum hours from 38 hours per fortnight to 30 hours per fortnight in time available as the number of additional people in a position to avail of the supplement would have to be ascertained, taking into account the availability of existing disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments.  Furthermore, as FIS is designed to ensure the maintenance of a significant attachment to the workforce, a reduction in the number of hours required to be eligible for FIS would work against the thrust of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8109">The annual cost of increasing the minimum FIS weekly payment from €20 to €30 is estimated at some €0.8 million.  This is based on the current number of people who are availing of the supplement and receiving the minimum payment.  It is not possible to estimate the cost of extending FIS to participants on back to work enterprise allowance (BTEA) scheme as FIS is a means-tested social assistance payment targeted at low-income families, while the back to work enterprise allowance programme is not means-tested, as it guarantees a percentage of the social welfare payment which applied prior to taking up self-employment, regardless of the level of income from the self-employment.  Any extension of FIS in the ways proposed would have to be considered in the context of policy development and budgetary constraints.</p>

            <p eId="para_8125">As of 1 June, 2006, the income disregard for Disability Allowance is no longer a flat income limit of €120 but instead operates on the basis of a tapered withdrawal rate between €120 and €350.  This means that all income up to €120 is disregarded as means when assessing entitlement, while income between €120 and €350 is assessed on the basis of 50 cents for every euro earned.  The effect of this tapered withdrawal rate is that a single person can earn up to €420 per week before their Disability Allowance fully ceases.</p>
            <p eId="para_8126">Prior to the introduction of the tapered withdrawal, a flat income limit of €120 was in place meaning that once a person exceeded earnings of €120 per week, payment of their Disability Allowance was withdrawn on a euro for euro basis.  The result of this approach for a single person was that he/she could earn up to a maximum of €240 per week before payment of Disability Allowance fully ceased.  The approach, suggested by the Deputy, of increasing the income disregard to €150 would have a full year cost of approximately €7.8m and would have the initial benefit of disregarding all income up to level.  However, this would also mean that all income above €150 would be assessed on a euro for euro basis, providing no incentive to increase earnings from employment above that level.</p>
            <p eId="para_8127">Such an approach conflicts with one of the underlying policy principles relating to incentives to work, i.e. that there must be a reward for working.  A review published by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2004 of the Illness and Disability Payment Schemes suggested that continually increasing the income disregard level is not the most appropriate answer to the disincentive problem.  Instead, that Review favoured introducing a mechanism which would allow for the gradual reduction of social welfare benefits as earnings increase, thereby allowing people who increase their earnings or employment potential to see an increase in the overall income level.  It was in this context that the tapered withdrawal rate was introduced in 2006 and has, thus far, resulted in a 30 per cent increase in the number of people availing of the disregard for earnings from rehabilitative employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_8129">Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.  The primary objective of the carer's allowance is to provide income support to low income carers. Carer's allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested.  This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need.</p>
            <p eId="para_8130">The carer's allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes.  The means test has been significantly eased over the years most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Budget 2007 provided for an income disregard for a couple of €640 per week.  This ensures a couple can earn in the region of €36,000 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance and the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_8131">In addition, the rates of carer's allowance have been increased to €200 per week for those aged under 66 and to €218 per week for those aged over 66.  From June 2005, the respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care and attention to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding jobseeker's allowance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition.  From June 2007, the level of the grant was increased by €300 to €1,500 per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8132">The complete abolition of the means test would have substantial cost implications and it is debatable whether this could be considered to be the best use of resources.  The view of some support and health organisations is that it would be much more beneficial to carers if additional resources were invested in the type of community care services which would support them in their caring role, such as additional respite care facilities, more home helps, public health nurses and other such services.  I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.</p>

As part of the control procedures under EU legislation governing these Schemes, the application was randomly selected for and was the subject of a ground eligibility and cross-compliance inspection.  During the course of the cross-compliance inspection, errors were discovered with regard to the identification and registration of bovine animals that resulted in a 1% cross compliance penalty being recorded.</p>

If the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held, the penalties will be applied as per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme. In this case the number of entitlements held by the person named is 43.58. As the difference between the area declared and the area found is more than 3%, under EU Regulations, the difference between the area found and the area claimed is doubled and deducted from the area found.

            <p eId="para_8246">I propose to take Questions Nos. 313 and 314 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8247">The operation of the Single Payment Scheme in Ireland, as in the case of other European Union Member States, is governed by the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, Commission Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004. The European Commission confirmed to my Department that under the provisions of these Regulations a farmer, who declares less eligible hectares than the number of payment entitlements he or she holds, is legally entitled to claim (utilise) different entitlements from the same set of entitlements each year thus ensuring that he does not lose entitlements to the National Reserve because of non usage.  The processing and payment system maintained by my Department recognizes this right.</p>
            <p eId="para_8248">This arrangement could not be applied in cases where farmers had two or more sets of entitlements at different values. These farmers were allowed to nominate the entitlements that they wanted to use each year so as to avoid the forfeiture of entitlements to the National Reserve for non-usage.  In the time available it has not been possible to determine the total value of payments made in 2005, 2006 and 2007 in these situations.   I will arrange to have this information made available to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</p>
            <p eId="para_8249">Under the provisions of Article 45 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, any payment entitlement that was not used for 3 years must, unless in cases of force majeure, be surrendered to the National Reserve.  My Department is currently commencing a review of all cases where entitlements were not used in 2005, 2006 and 2007.  This includes cases where a person activated his or her entitlements by submitting a Single Payment Scheme application in 2005 and did not declare any eligible hectares in any of the three years in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_8250">My Department will write to all of the farmers involved and they will be given an opportunity to submit written observations for consideration before a final decision is made to permanently surrender their entitlements to the National Reserve. The final outcome in relation to the level of unused entitlements will not be known until this process is complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_8251">Article 46 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 deals with the provisions covering the transfer of entitlements. Payment entitlements can be transferred by sale with or without land but can only be sold without land once 80% have been used (declares one hectare of eligible land for each entitlement) in one calendar year. There is provision in this Article that if a farmer does not meet the 80% requirement, he or she can sell entitlements without land only after he has surrendered all of the unused entitlements in the first year of operation of the scheme (2005 in Ireland's case). Payment entitlements may only be leased out (by lease or rental agreement) if they are accompanied by an equivalent number of hectares of eligible land.</p>

            <p eId="para_8270">Lough Swilly lost its approved zone status for the disease Bonamia ostrea in late 2006 following the isolation of the parasite in a sample taken as part of the routine monitoring program.  Once the disease has been introduced to an area it has proved difficult to eradicate it.  The Marine Institute together with the Department issued guidelines for containing the bonamia ostrea outbreak in Lough Swilly when it occurred.  These guidelines are still in place and need to be maintained in an effort to restrict any further spread of the parasite.</p>
            <p eId="para_8271">In addition, the Marine Institute has been carrying out an Epidemiological investigation to determine how the outbreak may have occurred and to investigate whether the parasite may have been introduced to any other areas prior to it's detection in Lough Swilly.  The report from this investigation is currently being compiled and is due to be submitted to the EU over the coming weeks.  While Bonamia ostrea can contribute to higher mortalities in oyster beds, it is not harmful to human health and consequently does not have any adverse effect on sales of product from the point of view of the consumer.</p>

            <p eId="para_8273">The Lough Swilly Wild Oyster Fishery is regulated by the issue of oyster fishing licences by the Northern Regional Fishery Board on an annual basis.  The Central and Regional Fisheries Boards come under the aegis of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I understand from the Northern Regional Fishery Board, however, that there are currently 27 such licences issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_8274">An application by the Lough Swilly Wild Oyster Development Association for an aquaculture licence under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997 in respect of some of the wild oyster beds in Lough Swilly is under consideration by my Department.  The areas sought by the Association overlap in part with areas already licensed by the Department for mussel cultivation.   This is a serious complicating factor in the orderly licensing of the area in question and is the subject of extensive ongoing examination by officials in the Aquaculture Licensing Section of my Department.</p>

         the practical ways of assisting teachers against bullying and sexual harassment from pupils particularly in second level schools. 
        [28054/07]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_581">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_8359">My Department has issued guidelines to the Management Authorities of second level schools on meeting their obligations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act to ensure the safety and health of their employees.  As in other workplaces, staff in second level schools may be victims of bullying or violentor intimidating behaviour.  While it may not be possible to prevent all such incidents, effective school policies concerning a range of issues can have a positive effect in reducing the risk of such incidents occurring and to minimise their consequences.  The close interaction of the school management with staff and parents in developing effective school policies on school discipline, bullying and health and safety contributes to a positive school environment where mutual respect, co-operation and natural justice are accepted features of the school community by all.</p>
            <p eId="para_8360">School Management Authorities are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.  The Code should be developed by the Principal and the staff in consultation with parents and approved by the School Management Authority.  Parents should be circularised regarding the Code when it is finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_8361">This Code should have as its aim the maintenance of desirable standards of behaviour, particularly in fostering understanding and co-operation between teachers, pupils and parents in helping schools to adapt to the needs of its students while establishing the basis for responsible actions by its students and observing the principles of natural justice. Any sanction imposed on a pupil should be in accordance with the Code of Discipline. Procedures for suspending pupils should be clearly set out in the school's Code of Discipline and should be adhered to. Aggressive, threatening or violent behaviour towards a teacher is regarded as serious or gross misbehaviour and may warrant suspension.</p>
            <p eId="para_8362">The National Educational Welfare Board is currently working on revised Guidelines for Developing School Codes of Behaviour.  This work is nearing completion and I expect that the revised Guidelines will be available shortly.  The Health and Safety Authority has also issued a Code of Practice on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying.  It defines workplace bullying as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual's right to dignity at work. An isolated incident of the behaviour described in this definition may be an affront to dignity at work but as a once off incident is not considered to be bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_8363">As a supportive resource, teachers can now access an Employee Assistance Service (EAS) specifically tailored to meet their particular needs.  The EAS now available to teachers throughout the country is designed to support the health and well-being of teachers which will in turn positively affect work quality and performance.  The service will incorporate confidential counselling on issues such as health, relationships, addictions, bereavement, stress, conflict, critical incident and trauma.</p>
            <p eId="para_8364">Services include, single session or short term structured telephone counselling, face to face short term confidential counselling as well as critical incident debriefing.  These services are intended to assist individual teachers and school communities to increase psychological resilience, improve communication, develop positive work relationships and enhance well-being.</p>

            <p eId="para_8366">My Department does not fund the employment of driving instructors in schools, and there are no plans to provide driving lessons as part of the road safety programmes being implemented in schools.  A Road Safety programme for use in Transition Year has been developed by the Road safety Authority in collaboration with my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Second Level Support Service. It  is currently being piloted in schools. The programme provides a structured approach towards the development of responsible attitudes towards road safety and driver education and builds on the knowledge gained from current Social Personal and Health Education programmes (SPHE). Covering areas such as seatbelt use, hazard perception and driver attitudes towards alcohol and drug use the Transition Year Road Safety Programme will also prepare students for the Driver Theory Test.</p>
            <p eId="para_8367">The Transition Year Road Safety Programme will be delivered by teachers in the classroom.  Theory test preparation will take place in the form of review questions relevant to the lesson at the end of each class which will be supported by a DVD resource based on commercially available preparation material.  The Road Safety Authority has also obtained input from the Gardaí, NCT centres and Bus Eireann in the delivery of this programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_8601">Earlier this year the person referred to by the Deputy was asked to provide preliminary advice on the merits of the submission by WIT, having regard to; (i) the national strategy for the development of Irish higher education, (ii) implications for regional development in the South-East in the context of the National Spatial Strategy and (iii) any likely implications for the overall structure of higher education in Ireland.  This report is currently under consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_8602">Aside from the very detailed statutory review process that is required in progressing an application, there are also significant wider issues that need to be considered in advance of any possible statutory review.  For example, there have been important wider policy developments in the overall higher education sector that are relevant in this context.  In particular, it is important that account be taken of the very significant recent changes in the overall legislative framework governing Irish higher education, with the commencement of the new Institutes of Technology Act 2006 on 1st February 2007, as well as wider Government policy on foot of the review of Irish higher education carried out by the OECD in 2004, the broad thrust of which was endorsed by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_8603">I am cognisant of the strong support that has been built in the south east region around the application from Waterford IT for university status.  However, wider policy developments must also be central to the consideration of the appropriate next steps in relation to the application.  WIT's application is currently being carefully assessed in that broad context and the work will be completed as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_8605">I have already outlined to the Deputy in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions that the law in relation to the use of safety restraint systems in buses reflects the requirements as set down in the relevant EU Directives and that these Directives do not require the provision of such systems for children travelling on buses fitted with safety belts.  I also pointed out that the law requires that occupants of buses who are 3 years of age or more must wear safety belts where they are fitted.  Because all nominated buses operating within the school transport scheme are fitted with safety belts, all pupils travelling on these vehicles are obliged by law to wear the belts provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_8606">The Deputy can also be assured that the safety of children travelling on the school transport service is of paramount importance to my Department and Bus Éireann which operates the school transport scheme.  Bus Éireann place special emphasis on safety and, to this end, have a wide range of checking procedures in place, in addition to statutory vehicle examinations, to ensure as far as reasonably possible that a safe and reliable service is delivered.  An accident involving a school transport vehicle would have to be fully investigated, in the normal way, by the relevant authorities. I cannot comment on hypothetical circumstances.  The stance taken by my Department would depend on all the circumstances of the particular case.</p>

            <p eId="para_8608">My Department provides for a scheme of grants towards the purchase of equipment for the use of students in second-level schools who have been diagnosed as having serious physical and/or communicative disabilities of a degree which makes ordinary communication through speech and/or writing impossible for them.  The purpose of the grant-aid is to provide the students in question with equipment of direct educational benefit to them.  Examples of such equipment include computers, word processors, tape recorders, software, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_8609">The scheme is driven by applications from schools on behalf of individual students, as and when specific needs present. Following the establishment of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), all applications for assistive technology are submitted by school management to the Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) with assigned responsibility for the school.  The SENO examines applications and makes a recommendation to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_8610">In this case, the advice my Department has received is that the provision of a laptop computer is not warranted as the application does not meet the required criteria.  Applications for assistive technology are only considered for those students with a Specific Learning Disability who are of average intelligence or higher and have a degree of learning disability specific to basic skills in reading, writing or mathematics, which places them at or below the 2nd percentile on suitable, standardised, norm-referenced tests.  The score in this instance was above the 2nd percentile.  I understand that the reason an alphasmart was suggested to the family was because it was regarded as a cheaper alternative in the event of their purchasing assistive technology from their own resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_8630">My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students.  These are the Higher Education Grants (HEG) Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' (VEC) Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses.  The HEG Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities on behalf of my Department.  The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.</p>
            <p eId="para_8631">Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  An approved third level course for the purpose of the HEG and the VEC Scholarship Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full time postgraduate course of not less than one years duration pursued in an approved institution.  The Schemes outline the respective courses which are approved for grant purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8632">The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC.  These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.</p>
            <p eId="para_8633">Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may, itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_8634">Under the terms of my Departments Schemes, candidates who have previously pursued an undergraduate course approved for the purposes of the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' Scholarship Scheme or the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees (formerly ESF Scheme) shall not receive a grant under this scheme until they have completed an equivalent period of study at undergraduate level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  Similarly, tuition fees under the Free Fees Initiative, are not payable in respect of a second period of college attendance on a course at the same level.</p>

            <p eId="para_8650">As the Deputy will be aware, a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004 have been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special needs.  The National Council for Special Education was required by the legislation to advise on implementation of the Act. My Department has been examining the Council's advice, including that in regard to co-ordinators, and in this context has held a series of consultations with the education partners on implementation issues. Arising from this process my Department is developing proposals for the implementation of the EPSEN Act. It is hoped to complete this work shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_8651">The sections of the EPSEN Act in respect of assessment and individual education plans (IEP) have not yet commenced.  However, services continue to be provided on a non-statutory basis and my Department continues to provide for the allocation of additional resources through the Council to enhance the capacity of the education system to meet special educational needs.  The Deputy may wish to note that in preparation for the statutory introduction of the individual education plan (IEP) process, the Council has published guidelines on the IEP process and a copy issued to all primary and post primary schools at the commencement of the 2006/2007 school year.  These guidelines provide advice and assistance to schools, teachers and parents on devising and implementing individual education plans. It is the Council's intention that schools will use these guidelines to draw up school policies and procedures in relation to individual education plans in advance of the mandatory requirement for them to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_8652">A further component of the preparation for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act in second level schools was the development of the "Inclusion of Students with Special Educational Needs: Post-Primary Guidelines" published by my Department's Inspectorate in June.  These guidelines, which were circulated to all second level schools, advocate a whole-school approach to effectively meet the educational needs of special needs students. Practical advice and guidance are provided on the organisation and co-ordination of resources to maximise the support to each individual student.</p>

            <p eId="para_8679">I propose to take Questions Nos. 356 to 358, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8680">My Department funds three maintenance grant schemes for third level students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.  These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education committees' Scholarship Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses.  The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities.  The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.  Under the terms of the maintenance grants schemes grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8681">The nationality requirement as set out in the 2007 Grant Schemes states:Candidates must:—</p>
            <p eId="para_8682">hold E.U. Nationality; or</p>
            <p eId="para_8683">have Official Refugee Status; or</p>
            <p eId="para_8684">have been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State (prior to the Immigration Act 1999); or</p>
            <p eId="para_8685">be a person in respect of whom the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has granted permission to remain following a determination not to make a deportation order under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999; or</p>
            <p eId="para_8686">have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State, or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; or</p>
            <p eId="para_8687">have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; or</p>

            <p eId="para_8689">Under the Residency requirement of the Schemes, the candidates' parents/guardians, or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, the candidate himself/herself must have been resident in the State from 1st October of the year prior to entry to an approved course.  The assessing authorities do, however, have discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional cases.</p>

Where the local contribution for a school exceeds €3,175 for expenditure incurred in the financial year January to December, the rental payment would be grant aided at a rate of 100%.

            <p eId="para_8696">The cost of providing free pre-school places for all children aged three to five is dependent on a number of factors including the type of model proposed.  Pre-school services operate across a wide range of curricular philosophical bases, e.g., Montessori, Steiner, High/Scope.  Other approaches include the Reggio Emilio approach.  Any estimated costing would depend on the models of intervention envisaged and assumptions about different variables within those models.  As these haven't been specified, it isn't possible to provide a costing as requested.</p>
            <p eId="para_8697">I would, however, like to point out while the mandatory school attendance age is 6, children from the age of 4 can enrol in primary schools.

            <p eId="para_8718">The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is a second — chance education initiative which is funded by my Department for unemployed persons who are at least 21 years of age and in receipt of certain social welfare payments for at least six months.  It is operated through the Vocational Education Committees.  The aim of the Scheme is to give unemployed people education and training opportunities which will develop and prepare them to go into paid employment, or on to further education opportunities leading to paid employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8719">A training allowance is paid by the VECs to students who previously drew unemployment benefit or assistance.

            <p eId="para_8722">Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places.  This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_8723">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.  In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion.  It is not unusual for some second-level schools to prioritise named feeder schools in their admissions policies.  This often reflects long standing connections between certain schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8724">However, in formulating an admissions policy a school must ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with Section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a number of matters including the admission of a pupil to the school.  Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department where an appeal is upheld the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.</p>
            <p eId="para_8725">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The Welfare Board has indicated that it will treat children for whom an appeal under Section 29 has been unsuccessful as priority cases in offering such assistance.  The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p>

            <p eId="para_8731">As part of new measures aimed at improving outcomes in Irish language learning and proficiency, a subject-specific support service for Irish has been established.  The service forms part of the Second Level Support Service (SLSS) which provides programme and subject specific curricular support, and support for teaching and learning generally in second-level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8732">The support service for Irish has been designed to provide professional development support to second-level teachers of Irish generally and support for the teaching and learning of all aspects of the curriculum.  One of the primary objectives of the service is to support the use of Gaeilge as a communicative language in schools and classrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_8733">The service is staffed by a dedicated team of professionals led by a National Coordinator and a team of six regionally based development officers.  The team is managed by the Steering Committee of the SLSS and its work is directed by a professional advisory group which includes representatives of my Department, the State Examinations Commission, An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochts, Foras na Gaeilge and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8734">To date the service has concentrated on the induction of team members and the preparation of seminars for teachers of First Year Irish.  54 seminars have been planned nationally for Term One.  It is hoped that two teachers of First Year Irish from all second-level schools will have had access to these seminars by the end of Term Two of the current school year.  It is also intended to offer a targeted seminar to teachers of First Year Irish in Irish-medium and Gaeltacht schools in the second term.</p>
            <p eId="para_8735">The support service has also been undertaking an audit of the professional development needs of the teachers with whom it has been working and this will inform its work into the future.  The service will shortly be looking at ways to make courses available to support teachers who wish to upskill themselves in the spoken language.</p>
            <p eId="para_8736">A co-ordinating committee, Coiste Comhordaithe na Gaeilge, has also been established to advise on co-operative elements of the overall work to be carried out on the promotion of the Irish language within the education system.  The committee is comprised of representatives from An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta (COGG), Údarás na Gaeilge and Foras na Gaeilge.

            <p eId="para_8745">Sections 14, 15 and 23 of the Education Act,1998 assigns each Board of Management and Principal Teacher responsibility for the day-to-day management of the school concerned.  The terms of Circular 16/73 provide that the Principal of primary schools should organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of the pupils during school hours. In particular, s/he should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks, lunch-breaks, assembly and dismissal. This circular was drawn up in consultation with the school management representative bodies at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_8746">Rules 121(4) and 124(1) of the Rules for National Schools and Section 23(2) of the Education Act 1998 oblige teachers to take all reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when the pupils are on school premises, during school time and/or on school activities. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of all teachers individually and collectively to provide a duty of care at all times towards the pupils in the school in which they teach, including periods of supervision remains.</p>
            <p eId="para_8747">While my Department does not issue specific guidelines on requirements for supervision of different age pupils, it acknowledges that the degree of supervision required of school authorities varies with the circumstances, including the age of the pupil.  Circular 11/95 (paragraph 3) states that a typical school day for Junior classes is 4 hours 40 minutes and  Senior classes 5 hours and 40 minutes with appropriate recreation.  This Circular is available on my Departments website at www.education.ie   In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of individual school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. The Statement should identify potential hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard the safety and health of employees and pupils. The Safety Statement should be reviewed on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_8748">Finally, in instances where children who are not availing of school transport arrive earlier than the school opening time the board should provide advice, through effective communication with the parents that the pupils are not to arrive before a certain time.</p>

            <p eId="para_8756">I have no plans to introduce driver education, in the form of driving lessons, in schools, and this is not the norm within the EU.  Research available internationally is inconclusive on the benefits of teaching young people to drive at school.  Particular issues highlighted include the gap arising between the time practical skills are learned initially and put into regular practice, and the risks arising from more young people taking up driving at an earlier age.</p>
            <p eId="para_8757">Nonetheless, I do believe that schools have a role to play both in teaching students about road safety issues and in helping them to develop the attitudes necessary to promote safe behaviour on the roads. The Social Personal and Health Education programme, which is mandatory in primary schools and at junior cycle level, provides a framework under which the generic values and skills which underpin responsible decision-making, and respect for the rights and safety of others can be developed and promoted among students. SPHE has a specific personal safety strand within the programme, and this provides a mechanism through which road safety issues for all can be best dealt with in an age appropriate way. In addition, the Civic Social and Political Education programme, also mandatory at junior cycle, deals with  important themes such as Law, Rights and Responsibilities, Democracy and Inter-dependence, which are also important in a road safety context.</p>
            <p eId="para_8758">The implementation of  SPHE and CSPE is being supported by resource materials on road safety developed by the Road Safety Authority. The RSA MACE "Safe to School" campaign at primary level was launched on 6 February 2007. It includes a DVD, posters, information leaflets, teacher worksheets for use within the SPHE curriculum, a guide for parents and a picture competition for students, and has been circulated to all primary schools.  There is also a website www.safetoschool.ie which includes a walking guide, quizzes etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_8759">The Streetwise programme for junior cycle pupils was launched in UN Road Safety Week on 24 April 2007. It covers road safety across 9 topics – walking, cycling, seatbelts, airbags, speed, driver fatigue, motor cycle safety, hazard recognition and the engineering aspects of road safety, to be delivered over approximately nine class periods.  Streetwise is available for live implementation in 2007/8 following a successful pilot.  A follow on programme has also been developed by the RSA in collaboration with my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Second Level Support Service for use in Transition Year, and is currently being piloted in schools.  Covering areas such as seatbelt use, hazard perception and driver attitudes towards alcohol and drug use the Transition Year Road Safety Programme will also prepare students for the Driver Theory Test. The Road Safety Authority has also obtained input from the Garda Síochána, NCT centres and Bus Eireann in the delivery of this programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_8790">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism or Asperger's syndrome, receive an education appropriate to their needs.  As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for the establishment of special classes for autism and for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_8791">During the 2006/2007 school year 75 autism specific classes were sanctioned by NCSE to cater for pupils with autism bringing the total now sanctioned to over 270.  My Department, conscious of the need to provide professional development for teachers of autistic children, permitted schools which were scheduled to open autism specific classes in September 2007 to recruit teachers two months early so that they could be trained in autism-specific teaching interventions and behavioural interventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_8792">The NCSE will continue to establish additional autism classes where the need arises in both special schools and mainstream primary and post-primary schools.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_8794">During the period of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006, record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems allowed a major acceleration of the school building programme. Over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second-level. This was the largest investment programme in the history of the State and delivered over 7,800 building projects involving tens of thousands of extra permanent school places. This investment has helped to increase capacity and transform the standard of accommodation in many schools throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_8795">Innovations in the delivery of school buildings such as Generic Repeat Designs and the use of the Design and Build model have been introduced to ensure that new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time-frame possible. Much greater authority has also been devolved to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thereby freeing my Department to concentrate on the larger scale projects. We have also improved forward planning through greater cooperation with Local Authorities and the publication of 10-year Area Development Plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_8796">The budget for 2007 is the first year of the roll out of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school buildings. This funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation with a particular focus on the needs of developing areas. We are planning for an expected 100,000 additional school places over the lifetime of the Plan. This year alone over €540 million will be spent on school building infrastructure with over 1,500 projects on my Department's school building programme. Construction in 2007 alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_8797">As part of our strategy for the provision of school places for 2008 and onwards my Department has also initiated a tender process for a drawdown contract facility that will be used to provide additional school places in the rapidly developing areas. This drawdown contract facility is aimed at providing school accommodation in very short timescales using modern methodologies such as off-site construction. My Department is also working closely with the relevant local authorities in relation to the acquisition of suitable sites for new schools and, where possible, pre-empting any planning issues that may arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_8798">The Deputy can be assured that my Department will target funding, as appropriate, in order to ensure that additional school accommodation is provided in developing areas within the earliest possible timeframes.</p>

            <p eId="para_8800">The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department. However, if the Deputy wishes to request details on a specific school, my officials will provide the required information.  The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8801">The focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary/prefabricated accommodation at primary level and to upgrade existing facilities, two new initiatives, the Permanent Accommodation Initiative and the Small School Initiative were launched in 2003 on a pilot basis. The purpose of these initiatives was to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money as opposed to the provision of temporary accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8802">The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased year on year and many schools are anxious to be included. In order to maintain this momentum I approved over 250 additional schools to participate in these schemes in 2007.  As a result of these schemes the amount spent on the purchase of prefabricated buildings in has been significantly reduced.</p>

            <p eId="para_8804">Individual school authorities are responsible in the first instance for health and safety issues at schools and it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and to put appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate the potential risk to the school community.</p>
            <p eId="para_8805">It is open to any school to apply to my Department for additional accommodation to meet its needs. All applications for capital funding are assessed in accordance with the Department's published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects which were drawn up following consultation with the education partners. Following this assessment, each application is assigned a band rating. Progress on individual projects is consistent with that band rating.  It is also open to school managements, where an immediate need for additional accommodation exists, to apply for the provision of temporary rented accommodation while awaiting the provision of permanent accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8806">Provision is built into the School Building and modernisation Programme to enable schools address urgent health and safety problems. In this regard, primary schools are given an annual allocation under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to school infrastructure.  My Department has invested in a record school building programme which between 2000 and 2007 involved the delivery of over 9,000 projects with an investment of over €3 billion. The budget for 2007, at over €540m, is the first year of the roll out of the new NDP which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school buildings in the coming years.</p>
            <p eId="para_8807">This multi-annual funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation having particular regard to the needs of developing areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_8809">I wish to advise the Deputy that the level of resources being made available by my Department to support students with special educational needs nationally has grown significantly in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_8810">A significant development is the establishment of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which has been in operation since 1 January 2005 with over 90 members of staff working exclusively in supporting students with special educational needs. The NCSE was established under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act (EPSEN) 2004 to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children. Since it was established in 2005, the NCSE has been responsible for allocating resources for children with special educational needs. The NCSE has a key role in the delivery of services and operates through a network of special educational needs organisers (SENOs) who act as a focal point of contact for schools and parents. SENOs are responsible for processing applications from schools for special needs supports and they convey decisions on the applications directly to the schools. These supports include resource teaching hours, special needs assistant (SNA) support and assistive technology and equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8811">Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes/units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_8812">At primary level, there are now over 6,000 teachers working directly with children with special educational needs, including those requiring learning support, compared with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. At post-primary level, over 2,450 wholetime equivalent teachers support special needs students compared with 200 in 1998. This includes 566 learning support teachers. Significant progress has been made in relation to increasing the number of SNAs in our schools who specifically cater for children with care needs. There are over 8,800 whole time equivalent SNAs in primary and post-primary schools supporting the care needs of these students compared with approximately 300 in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_8813">As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment. For example, more than €3million was spent last year on specialised equipment and materials and nearly €50million on school transport for special needs pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_8814">In addition to the developments outlined above, my Department's Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally. The SESS now has 13 full time seconded teachers and 16 part-time associates and had contact with some 15,000 teachers in the last year. Furthermore, the SESS will be undertaking a recruitment drive in the near future to facilitate an increased level of training.</p>
            <p eId="para_8815">Going forward, the NCSE has produced an Implementation Report regarding the EPSEN Act, which is currently receiving detailed consideration within my Department. As part of this process, my officials have met with the education partners to obtain their views on the report and its recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_8816">I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues to be a key Government priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_8832">The Deputy will, I'm sure, be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA and have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS. The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_8833">The Deputy will also be aware that since NEPS was established, we have trebled the number of psychologists in the service. Notwithstanding this and as I have previously announced my Department is committed to increasing psychological service staffing further, so that by 2009 there will be 200 NEPS psychologists.  To this end I can inform the Deputy that my Department has been working, in conjunction with the Public Appointments Commission to recruit new psychologists from an existing panel to the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_8834">The number of psychologists as of April 2007 stood at 128 including 4 assigned to the National Behavioural Support Service and to the Further Education Service. Since then nine individuals have been appointed in this regard. This advance in numbers has been reduced somewhat by the effects of resignations and retirement and the compliment in service currently stands at 134.  Three further psychologists are due to join NEPS under this process between now and early January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_8835">The panel concerned is now exhausted and the Public Appointments Service has recently announced the commencement of a competition from which a new panel will be drawn to continue the recruitment process. The deadline for receipt of applications in this regard has now passed and work is proceeding on the short-listing of candidates for interview. It is envisaged that the process will be completed and panels formed by the end of next month allowing recruitment to re-commence early in 2008.  My Department remains committed to the development of a strong and robust educational psychological service serving the needs of all primary and post-primary pupils.</p>

            <p eId="para_8854">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.</p>
            <p eId="para_8855">Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_8856">A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</p>
            <p eId="para_8857">The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years in order to reduce class sizes. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

            <p eId="para_8859">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8860">Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.  Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.</p>
            <p eId="para_8861">Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment.  Each school management authority is required to organise its time-table and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.  The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions.</p>
            <p eId="para_8862">An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.  The primary staffing appeal board and the post primary appeal committee operate independently of the Department and it's decision is final.</p>

        <b>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</b>
         asked the

         the mechanisms that exist in her Department to alert her to upcoming school accommodation requirements arising from population trends before such requirements become a necessity and with a view to engaging in adequate forward planning to ensure a streamlined provision of accommodation as required, as opposed to the present system; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_8864">The general process of assessing and planning for the need for additional provision at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing and other developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.  Local Authorities are obliged by statute to refer  draft local area development plans to the Department for observation and comment so that lands can be zoned for future education use.  There are numerous sites reserved for education purposes under this process particularly in rapidly developing areas.  Once subsequent residential planning permissions are consistent with these plans, the focus for the Department is one of collaboration with the local authority to ensure that the lands set aside for educational provision can be acquired and developed as they are needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_8865">To deal with this increasing demand for school places, the Government is providing funding of €4.5 billion over the lifetime of the new National Development Plan (NDP).  This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and it will enable my Department to ensure that school places are available where needed as well as continuing to upgrade existing school facilities.  This investment will allow my Department to continue the school building programme which commenced during the life time of the last NDP when well over €2.6 billion was invested in school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_8866">The budget for 2007 is the first year of the roll out of the new NDP. This funding will enable my Department to continue to provide modern school accommodation on an on-going basis, particularly in developing areas.  This year alone around over €540 million will be spent on school building infrastructure with over 1,500 projects on my Department's school building programme.  Construction in 2007 alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_8868">The person concerned retired on grounds of ill-health from his position as a civilian employee with the Defence Forces in April 1986.  He was awarded a gratuity amounting to £4,709.33 and a yearly pension amounting to £508.61 on retirement, under the terms of the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees.  The person in question received on his retirement all of his entitlements under this pension scheme.  Over the years, the rate of occupational pension paid to the person concerned has been increased in line with pay awards, both general and special, for serving civilian employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_8869">Under the terms of the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees, the rate of occupational pension paid to a retired civilian employee must be re-calculated at age 65 years to take account of any increases in the level of social welfare benefits due at that stage so that there is no net financial gain from the two sources of income.  As a result of the increase in the rate of social welfare benefits due to the person concerned from his 65th birthday, the rate of occupational pension paid to the person in question was reduced when he attained the age of 65 years in June 1997.</p>

            <p eId="para_8904">Where a person in receipt of a service pension under the Defence Forces Pensions Schemes is granted a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts, the Schemes provide that the service pension must be reduced (or abated) — usually by an amount equal to one-half of the disability pension.  The reduction is applied to the service pension and not to the disability pension, which is paid in full.  There is an advantage to the pensioner in this arrangement because disability pensions are exempt from income tax whereas service pensions are liable to tax.  The provisions outlined are of long-standing and the objective is to limit the total amount payable by way of pension.  The principle involved is not unique to the Defence Forces and is applied generally in the public service.</p>

The Unit currently comprises one Sergeant and nine Gardaí, who are drawn from each of the Garda sub-Districts.  Ongoing liaison is also maintained with the Garda National Drugs Unit in respect of persons suspected of being involved in the illegal importation and / or distribution of drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_9010">The Deputy will be aware that resources such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also deployed extensively in dealing with drug crime and the detection and prevention of drug related crime is, of course, a matter for all members of An Garda Síochána.  The increases taking place in the overall strength of An Garda Síochána will continue to assist in enabling additional Garda resources to be targeted at the areas of greatest need, with areas where there is a significant drug problem being deemed a particular priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_9011">As the Deputy will appreciate, policing operations and the deployment of Garda resources are matters for the Garda Commissioner. It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel within the Garda organisation on a priority basis in accordance with overall policing requirements.   The assignment of Garda personnel throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</p>
            <p eId="para_9012">In such a context, I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the proposal to establish a dedicated drugs unit in the areas referred to by the Deputy is under consideration by senior Garda management in the current preparation of An Garda Síochána's policing plans for 2008.</p>

Where all the required documentation/evidence has been furnished and the Visa Officer is satisfied with the bona fides of the application, a D-type Visa would normally be approved.  In very exceptional cases, where a Visa Officer has concerns over the relationship history for example, a C-type Visa might be approved.  The rationale for this is that the applicant is being afforded the opportunity to demonstrate the existence of the relationship.

            <p eId="para_9070">The Reception &amp; Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is charged with, inter alia, responsibility for the  accommodation of asylum seekers while their applications for asylum are processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_9071">The centre in Ballaghadereen was first contracted to the RIA for the accommodation of asylum seekers on 13 July, 2004 for an initial period of 20 weeks, after which the contract was renewed. The current contract will expire on 6 July, 2009 when its future as an asylum centre will be reassessed.  The centre has a capacity for 86 persons and the occupancy at week ending 2 October 2007 was 67.  In some instances it is not possible to have full occupancy due to family configuration; for example, a family of three occupying rooms that could accommodate four or five. Aside from this non-occupancy arising from family configuration, there are also seven spaces currently vacant in the centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_9072">In fulfilling its general accommodation responsibilities, the RIA does not ‘lease' premises from commercial contractors.  Rather it ‘contracts-in' a comprehensive range of services and facilities, which include accommodation, housekeeping, etc., for a fixed sum over the period of the contract.   The RIA endeavours to achieve the best value for money in relation to such contracts, in respect of which negotiations can take place with a number of commercial entities.  It is not in the interests of the taxpayer that details of individual contracts are made known both to the public and to other parties who are, or may be in the future, engaged in negotiations with the RIA.</p>
            <p eId="para_9073">I am therefore unable to provide, in respect of the premises cited in the question, the detailed financial information requested by the Deputy, as its release could negatively affect the competitive position of the State.  I can confirm, however, that the rates are within the normal range of  €133-165 per person per week (pppw) for self catering centres.</p>

            <p eId="para_9089">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007. Part 13 of the Act relating to anti-social behaviour by children was commenced on 1 March, 2007. These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Childrens' Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_9090">The number of behaviour orders issued in each Garda Division in the Dublin Metropolitan Region is set out in the table.  Figures are provisional, operational and liable to change.</p>

            <p eId="para_9361">I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that An Garda Síochána has two Driving Schools, one based at Garda Headquarters and one based at the Garda College. Both Driving Schools have had significant personnel increases in 2007 to respond to the increased need for Driver Training. The staffing level at the Garda Headquarters Driving School and the Garda College Driving School increased from 13 to 15 and 15 to 23 respectively. This increase in personnel has resulted in an increase of 100% in the output of driving courses being provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_9362">It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the force taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Garda Driving Schools will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Divisions throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_9439">Following the submission in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, it was decided that the compilation and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose. Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006. In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003. I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.</p>

I am pleased to state that an additional 26 civil servants will be appointed to the GCVU in the coming weeks, which is further to an additional 12 civil servants who commenced work in the GCVU in September 2007.  This substantial increase in staff numbers is to facilitate the continuing significant expansion in the employee vetting service provided by the GCVU, as a means of promoting, inter alia, the protection of children and vulnerable adults.</p>

            <p eId="para_9445">I assume the Deputy's question refers to Argentinian nationals whose only direct lineal ancestor to have been born in Ireland was a great-grandparent.  My Department has been engaged in extensive correspondence over the last number of years in relation to the question of Irish citizenship for the three individuals concerned and the broader issue of Irish citizenship for Argentinian nationals of Irish descent.</p>
            <p eId="para_9446">The position is that the great-grandchildren of persons born in Ireland can obtain Irish citizenship by registering in the Foreign Births Register provided either of their parents had at the time of their birth acquired Irish citizenship through registration in the Foreign Births Register.  There is one exception to that rule.  If one parent had registered in the Foreign Births Register prior to 31 December 1986, their child can register even if the parent had not registered at the time of that person's birth.</p>
            <p eId="para_9447">If persons are not entitled to Irish citizenship in these circumstances, they can apply for Irish citizenship through naturalisation.  Such applications are considered under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts 1956 — 2004.  The applicant must fulfil certain statutory requirements including requirements in relation to residency.  However I am empowered to dispense with the statutory conditions in whole or in part in certain circumstances — for example where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.  Every such application is decided upon on its individual circumstances and in accordance with the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_9448">The three persons referred to in the Deputy's question lodged applications for naturalisation in 2002.  Having considered all of the information available at that time, the three applications were refused.  It is, of course, open to the individuals to apply again for naturalisation at any time in the future.  Any such applications will be considered in the context of the legislation in force at that time.</p>

            <p eId="para_9477">The person in question entered the State on 16 November, 2002 on foot of a work permit.  He resigned from his employment in October, 2005 and therefore had no legal reason to remain in the State.  On 4 October, 2006 the person in question signed a declaration of consent to deportation which was witnesses by a member of An Garda Síochána. A request was then made to my Department by An Garda Síochána requesting the making of a deportation order.</p>
            <p eId="para_9478">On receipt of this request the case of the person concerned was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act,1999 as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 on the Prohibition of Refoulement. On 25th November, 2006 my predecessor refused temporary leave to remain in the State and a deportation order was signed in respect of the person concerned. Notice of this order was subsequently served by members of An Garda Síochána by hand on the person concerned in Castlerea Prison, in order for him to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_9479">A consent for deportation order as served on the person concerned is only valid for 3 months pursuant to section 3 subsection 8 of the Immigration Act 1999. This deportation order has since expired. A fresh notice to deport letter was issued by An Garda Síochána by hand to the person concerned in Castlerea Prison on 14th March 2007. Fresh representations were received from the person concerned by my Department on 26th March 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_9480">As the case of the person concerned is still under consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 his passport cannot be returned at this stage.  This person's case file will be examined under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996.  I expect the file to be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_9490">The number of non-EEA national children between the ages of 16 and 18 who are registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau is 1,672.  A non-EEA national child on reaching the age of 16 years must register his/her presence in the State.  In line with all immigration decisions each case is considered on its own merits.  A registration officer upon registration of the child will have regard to the particular circumstances of the child including the immigration status of the child's parents.  In the main, non-EEA children who are in the State as dependants of foreign national parents on reaching 16 years of age are given stamp 2 or 2A.  The issuance of stamp 2 or 2A is in line with current policy as the children are present in the State as students.</p>

            <p eId="para_9513">The Garda Síochána is expanding its town centre CCTV programme and Ennis is one of the 14 new locations where Garda CCTV systems will be installed.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that tenders for the provision of a CCTV system for Ennis have been evaluated and it is expected that a contract for installation of the system will be awarded in the coming weeks.  Once contracts are in place, work will commence on the installation of the CCTV system, subject to planning permissions, wayleaves and any civil works required.  It is expected that the system in Ennis will become operational during 2008.  Earlier this year the Garda authorities carried out a project involving three locations and included the use of wireless and digital technologies.  Evaluation of these technologies was required to be completed before progressing to procurement for further locations.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_9515">The Deputy's question calls for a consideration of the definition of "victim" in the context of victim impact statements and raises the question of whether the definition should be extended to such an extent that, in at least some instances, the local community could be regarded as a "victim".  The relevant legislation on the issue, section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993, foresees that only those directly affected by the crime may be regarded as victims. The section specifies that a victim impact statement may be delivered by or on behalf of the living victim of a variety of crimes that are listed in that section.</p>
            <p eId="para_9516">However, no legislative provision exists that permits the family, friends or other associates of a victim to give or make a statement.  Nevertheless, a practice has developed, especially in homicide cases, by which a sentencing judge may exercise a discretion to permit a victim impact statement to be made by or on behalf of the family or friends of a victim (as, of course, the direct victim is not alive).  I have asked the Department to reflect on the question of victim impact statements, taking account not only of issues raised by the recent debate on the subject but also of the recommendations of the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group, chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan SC, in its report earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_9517">The Review Group made a number of very helpful comments.  In relation to the current arrangements under section 5 of the 1993 Act, it suggested the section may be too restrictive in so far as it permits a statement by or on behalf of the direct victim only.  It suggests there is a case for expanding the definition of ‘victim' to include other persons intimately affected by the crime.  The Review Group also goes on to discuss the possible use of victim impact statements at the parole or remission stage and places this issue in the context of restorative justice, i.e. the victim would have an opportunity to address the perpetrator directly, to make him or her realise more fully the harm that has been done.</p>
            <p eId="para_9518">In a further recommendation, the Review Group addressed the possibility of inappropriate use of statements and raised the possibility of restrictions on publication in certain circumstances, at the direction of the court.  I will continue to reflect on and consider how the current system can be improved.  In my considerations, I will wish to ensure that the victim is allowed as much opportunity as reasonably possible to have his or her experiences taken into account.  I must also ensure that, in the interests of all parties, we preserve the integrity of the criminal process and that due process continues to be observed.  The Deputy will appreciate the issues involved are complex and require careful consideration.  It will therefore be necessary to take some time to ensure any proposals are appropriate and well grounded.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_9524">As stated in the reply to Question No. 263 of 24 October 2007, the introduction of legislation relating to the governing of management companies is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Planning and Development Act 2000 sets the statutory framework within which planning authorities must take estates in charge.  In addition to the legal framework, my Department has also issued comprehensive policy guidance on the taking in charge of estates.</p>
            <p eId="para_9525">In circular letter PD1/06, Planning Authorities were reminded of their responsibilities in this area and were asked, as a priority, to establish a policy on taking in charge to be approved by the members of the authority and to be reported on to the members on a regular basis or at least once annually.  In July 2006, my Department's circular letter PD5/06 to Planning Authorities stated that conditions requiring management companies should not be attached to planning permissions for traditional housing estates — estates of houses with individual private gardens — except in very specific circumstances.  Such circumstances would include, for example, the maintenance of a particular service or shared facility that is provided for residents' use only, such as a playground.</p>
            <p eId="para_9526">The circular acknowledged, however, that the question of who should be responsible for the maintenance of certain shared facilities in newer types of mixed estates needed further examination.  Accordingly, my Department established a Working Group, including representatives of local authorities, architects, planners and consumer interests, to consider this and other issues related to the taking in charge of estates.  The Group considered the issue of responsibility for the maintenance of common shared facilities in residential estates including small open spaces, car parking and playgrounds, and also looked at issues relating to the completion of estates and the taking in charge process.  The Group has completed its work and has produced suggested draft policy guidance for my consideration.  I have asked my Department to re-examine a number of issues, particularly in the context of the new programme for Government, and I expect this process to be completed shortly.</p>

The manner of hunting allowed during this annual open season is shooting with firearms, coursing at regulated coursing matches or hunting under licence with packs of beagles and harriers.

Gardaí also have the authority to arrest or to assist in arresting a suspected person if that person continues or recommences that activity or fails to furnish their name or address or furnishes a name or address which, in the circumstances, there are reasonable grounds to suspect is false or misleading.</p>

The provisions in relation to pre-application consultations between planning authorities and prospective applicants  already contained in Section 247 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, combined with the very extensive public notification and participation provisions set out under planning legislation detailed in the previous above reply mentioned provides a robust framework for addressing the concerns raised.

            <p eId="para_9627">Gunnera tinctoria is a large herbaceous plant that forms dense colonies that shade out and suppress native vegetation. This species is a vigorous seeder and also has the ability to spread vegetatively.   Intense effort is required to control this species.  In 2006, a two year M.Sc. project was initiated to investigate measures for the control of Gunnera on Achill Island.  The project is funded by Mayo County Council, and by my Department through the Biodiversity Fund which is administered by the Heritage Council.</p>

It is my intention to make regulations under this section in the first quarter of 2008, and to provide for a short lead-in time, after which possession or introduction of Gunnera will be prohibited.   Whilst I recognise that the plant is already in the wild, my purpose is to prevent its further dispersal through garden centres for use around ponds and wet areas, from which it may escape or be released into the wild.</p>

            <p eId="para_9630">The European Commission has, on three occasions, attempted to overturn the Austrian national ban on certain genetically modified maize.  The Commission's most recent proposal was considered at the Environment Council on 30 October 2007.  On this occasion the Commission sought only to overturn the prohibition on the import and processing of the maize kernels for use in food and feed; cultivation was excluded from the Commission's proposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_9631">The change in the proposal was prompted by the Environment Council Decision on 18 December 2006, that ‘different agricultural and regional ecological characteristics' should be taken into account.  It was also prompted by the impending deadline of 21 November 2007 for compliance with World Trade Organisation (WTO) requirements.  The Commission is satisfied that should the ban on food and feed be lifted, the US (and possibly other countries) would be much less likely to invoke action against the EU for breach of WTO rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_9632">Ireland supported Austria in each of the three votes on the Commission's proposals.  While there was a qualified majority against the Commission on the first two occasions when it sought to overturn the Austrian ban, there was no qualified majority for or against the Commission proposal at the most recent vote at the European Environment Council.  In these circumstances, it is open to the Commission to implement its proposal to overturn the Austrian ban in regard to food and feed.  Austria indicated at the Council meeting on 30 October that it would finalise a further report on 20 November justifying its action in invoking the bans on certain maize lines.  In my view, Austria should have been allowed to complete its report and present its findings for consideration before any further action was taken in relation to the national bans.</p>

The Department supports the local fire authorities through the setting of general policy, the provision of capital funding, the issue of guidance to fire authorities in relation to fire prevention and operational matters and other such initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_9651">Under the annual Fire Services Capital Programmes in the period since 1998 to 2006 Clare County Council has received approval for 6 new fire appliances at a cost of around €1.3m and a new emergency tender at a cost of €265,000.  In August 2007, under the 2007 Fire Services Capital Programme, Clare County Council received approval to purchase one new Class B Fire Appliance at a cost of €288,000.  While the Department has not received any proposal for additional water tankers from Clare County Council, I understand that the Council intends to submit a formal application for funding.  Any such proposal will be considered under the Department's 2008 fire services capital programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_9657">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the recent increase in the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA) levy.  NORA is a statutory agency under the aegis of my Department and has responsibility for ensuring that Ireland meets its EU and International obligations to maintain reserves of national strategic oil stocks.  The NORA levy is imposed on the consumption of oil products and is used to fund NORA's activities.  NORA receives no Exchequer funding.  The level of the NORA levy remained unchanged at 0.476 cent per litre from NORA's establishment in 1995 until 31 October 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_9658">Earlier this year, I made Regulations under the National Oil Reserves Agency Act 2007, which provide that with effect from 1 November 2007, the rate of the levy rises to 1.00 cent per litre.  Under the previous arrangements, the NORA levy generated income of €37 million in 2006.  Based on the 2006 levy income the increased levy could be expected to generate an additional €40 million per annum.  This will allow NORA to maintain and increase the level of strategic oil stocks held by NORA in line with EU and International obligations.  It will also underpin the Government's objective as set out in the White Paper, to maximise Ireland's wholly-owned stocks of oil and the level of stocks held on this island.</p>

            <p eId="para_9660">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  ComReg are responsible for the compiling of statistics on broadband uptake. I understand that these statistics are collected on a national basis only.  Further information on broadband service providers in north Dublin is available on my Department's broadband website, www.broadband.gov.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_9661">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.  The first phase of the procurement process, Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)   is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, Eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.</p>
            <p eId="para_9662">The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process.  My Department is anticipating that the award of the NBS contract will be Quarter 2 of 2008, with roll-out of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.</p>

            <p eId="para_9713">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation.  Broadband access is currently available in the areas mentioned from numerous service providers.  Further details are available on the Department's broadband website www.broadband.gov.ie.</p>

            <p eId="para_9717">The Greener Homes Scheme has been very successful since its launch in March 2006, with 16,000 grants approved since its inception.  The aim of this scheme was to stimulate demand for renewable heat technologies in homes.  Phase I of the Greener Homes Scheme delivered within budget in 18 months what was originally envisaged as a five-year programme and all of the €47m budget is now committed.  Since Phase I was launched, the number of registered renewable energy installers has increased dramatically and there has been a ten-fold increase in products available on the Irish market.  This clearly demonstrates the very significant level of market development since the scheme was first launched.</p>
            <p eId="para_9718">The consistently high demand for the scheme showed that there was a clear opportunity to further develop the sector and make an even greater contribution to reducing fossil fuel dependence.  Consequently I released €10m from the Information and Communications Technology Programme.  While significant progress had been made on the procurement process for this scheme, no substantial expenditure was likely to be incurred until some time after a service provider has been appointed.  This is expected to happen during quarter 2 of 2008.  While discussions were held with SEI, no lobbying was received from any parties for this inter-vote virement.  Certain payments from these programmes were put back into 2008 to allow SEI meet their more immediate demands.</p>
