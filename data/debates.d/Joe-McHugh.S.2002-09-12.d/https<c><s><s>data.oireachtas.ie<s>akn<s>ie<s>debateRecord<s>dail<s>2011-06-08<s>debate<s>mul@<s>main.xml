          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_1">During his put-down of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, last week, the Taoiseach stated unequivocally that Ireland is funded until 2014 in all circumstances.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, repeated this on a number of occasions.  They both also stated that a 1% reduction in the interest rate payable on the bailout would be worth more than €400 million per year to Ireland.  The Taoiseach could not have been clearer on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Yesterday, without warning, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, changed that scenario when he told the House that, in fact, we are not funded for 2013.  Almost in the same breath he halved the projected saving we would get from an interest rate cut.  Clearly following the Taoiseach's lead when he downgraded the jobs budget, the Minister then attacked others for supposedly exaggerating the importance of this issue and the figures involved, saying they are to blame for hyping it up.  The fact is that this issue was hyped up by the Taoiseach, his party and his partners in government — we remember the talk of Frankfurt's way or Labour's way.  That happened throughout the election and in the weeks after it.  Trying to whitewash away those promises will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">What was made clear on these two key issues last week has now been directly and entirely undermined.  Are we fully funded for 2013, as the Taoiseach said last week, or are we not, as the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said yesterday?</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_5">Are we still negotiating for reduced interest rate payments of €400 million, as the Taoiseach and the Minister said last week, or have we settled for the €200 million the Minister talked about yesterday?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_6">Deputy Martin started with an assertion that I said we are funded until 2014 in all circumstances.  That is not what I said.  The Deputy is aware that the bailout deal goes well into 2013.  The position is that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, yesterday set out clearly the situation in so far as answering the questions he was asked.  He said quite clearly that he is not prepared to negotiate on the basis of giving up Ireland's corporate tax rate for a basis point reduction that would be worth approximately €150 million to Ireland.  He is right in that.  On 11 March, one or two days after the Government was formed, at the first European leaders' summit I had the privilege of attending, I made it very clear that Ireland would not concede an increase in our corporate tax rate.  We had a very healthy scepticism about what I viewed as tax harmonisation by the back door in respect of CCTB.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">A total of €15.6 billion has been drawn down from the financial packages, comprising €11.4 billion from the EFSM and €4.2 billion from the EFSF.  This means that any interest rate reduction would apply in respect only of the remaining moneys of €24.6 billion.  The Heads of Government devolved the negotiating right for the reduction of interest rates to the Ministers for Finance, and that is being pursued.  I have been to Washington and New York, where I confirmed to business interests Ireland's message that we are not shifting from the 12.5% corporate tax rate.</p>

          <p eId="para_9">I made that clear to all and sundry at the first meeting of the European Heads of Government.  It is time for Europe to focus on what it needs to do to help countries which are making a committed and genuine effort to get out of the economic difficulties they face.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_11">It is also a necessity to focus on restructuring the kind of system that will apply under the ESM when it comes into operation in July 2013.  We do not want a situation where one enters a mechanism out of which one cannot get.  That is an issue I intend to raise at the meeting of the European Heads of Government later this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">In essence, Ireland is not conceding on its 12.5% corporate tax rate, and we will continue to push for the interest rate reduction to which the OECD, the IMF, Commissioner Olli Rehn, other Commissioners and other countries have said we are entitled.  It is unfair, having renegotiated in the circumstances of the austere set of conditions in which we found ourselves, that some are of the view, because of national interests, that we should not have an interest rate reduction which has been applied to others without extra conditions being imposed on Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_14">When Mr. Papandreou spoke to me before the meeting in Brussels, he was seeking a 2% reduction in the interest rate, as well as an extension of time, and I told him we would be highly supportive of helping the Greek people and Government in their difficulties.  As matters stood, Greece was not within the EFSF but was outside that mechanism and a 1% reduction was given, as well an extension of time that he had requested.  The agreement was that countries within the EFSF bailout mechanism could have an interest rate reduction applied to them.  The Minister for Finance continues to negotiate in this regard on our behalf.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  The Taoiseach has now just confirmed that close to half of the bailout fund is beyond any reduction in interest rates.  More than three months have elapsed since all governments in Europe agreed that funding costs, as it was put, "should be lowered to better take into account debt sustainability of the recipient countries".  Since then, the only thing that has been lowered is the amount for which we appear to be negotiating.  Delay, uncertainty and regular leaking by different countries is causing immense damage——</p>

          <p eId="para_116">What I said was that the principle had been accepted and the decision was made subsequently to devolve responsibility for that negotiation to the Finance Ministers, which matter is being pursued.  The Deputy should appreciate that both myself, the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Creighton, have raised the issue of the interest rate reduction with very many countries and very many connections such as Hungary, Poland, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Greece, United Kingdom and others and we will continue to do so.  I expect that the principle that was accepted here of an interest rate reduction is what is now being pursued by the Minister for Finance.  I make the point again that I believe that the difficulties being encountered in Greece and to a lesser extent, in Portugal, are of serious concern to the eurozone countries and must be looked at in a very serious light.  From that point of view, I believe that Europe must look at where it is headed and how it can best support those countries in a bailout situation.  In Ireland's case, we are meeting very difficult and challenging circumstances but are on track to and the assistance that has been agreed in principle should be applied to our country.  That is why the Minister for Finance and his colleagues are pursuing this at their level of responsibility.  Deputy Martin asked if we are funded until the end of this bailout and I answer that we are, until well into 2013.  One could ask the question about the United States, whether that country is funded through to 2013.  President Obama has had to make some serious changes.</p>

As regards the special needs assistants, the Minister announced 90% of the allocation and there will be more special needs assistants teaching and doing their work this year than previously.  However, in order to comply with the regulations and conditions, the Minister announced 90% of the allocation as a start.  The report into the position of special needs assistance deserves serious debate by this House because it contains some recommendations and revelations that are quite startling in respect of the pressure on professionals to declare children as being in need of special needs assistance when many of them might well not require that assistance for the duration of their school days.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">In response to the issues raised by Deputies Martin, McDonald and Higgins, in the last number of Dáileanna we had so many committees that Deputies were running from one committee room to another to make up quorums to commence meetings which then disintegrated.  What we have looked at is a restructuring of the way in which committee work is carried out in the House.  It is true that the work rate and areas to be dealt with by committee have been expanded.  A saving of some 35% will be made and there are no allowances for deputy Chairmen, convenors, Whips or deputy Whips, although there is an independent allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">On the point made about the Committee of Public Accounts, while the Chair of the committee has always gone to a member of the Opposition, its composition is strictly proportionate to the reflected vote of the people in the Dáil.  The Fianna Fáil Party's wish for an expanded finance committee has been agreed to.  There will be no question of ramming through legislation because we intend that the committees will have a proper opportunity to debate and reflect on issues that come before them.  From September onwards, heads of Bills will come before the committees.  Sub-committees can be set up to deal with particular legislation if necessary.  It is a matter for each committee as to how it structures its business and, as the Deputy is aware, it is open to every Member of the House to attend any committee.  While non-members do not have a vote, they may contribute and participate in the proceedings that are under deliberation.  I hope I have clarified those points.</p>

I do not believe there is any necessity to guillotine this Bill and shorten the duration of its consideration and time allocated for its debate in the House to the degree proposed by the Government.  We have had many commitments about Dáil reform and many fine statements about accountability and strengthening the role of Parliament.  Every party elected with a mandate coming out of the last election resolved and was committed to putting into effect real and meaningful reform of how this Chamber operates and of how politics works.  I have not seen anything emanating from the Government benches that gives any substance or depth to the issue of Dáil reform or accountability.  The guillotining of this Bill is a further illustration and example of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">There are 19 measures in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, all of which will have very far-reaching effects on ordinary people, particularly working people.  For some of us it looks like a menu to make ordinary working people work longer and harder for less over the course of their lifetimes, particularly hitting the least well off and manual workers who will be forced to work longer.  To push all those measures through in such a short time without allowing adequate time for debate is a subversion of democratic debate in this House and this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_478">As I outlined in my response to questions in this House on 24 May, I met with Prime Minister Cameron in Government Buildings on the evening of Wednesday, 18 May.  Our discussions focused on the complete transformation of the relationship between Britain and Ireland in recent years.  The closeness of that relationship has been demonstrated by the warmth with which the Queen was received in this country.  We also discussed EU issues and our shared economic difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">There was no explicit discussion about the interest rate on the bilateral loan extended from Britain, nor was it intended that there should be.  We did, however, discuss broader EU and international economic and political developments and the Government's approach to getting an improved deal from our external partners.  I am satisfied that the UK Government understands our position and will be as supportive as it can.</p>
            <p eId="para_480">We continue to negotiate with our colleagues at European level about the conditions and the extent of the improvements that might be made on the IMF-EU bailout deal.</p>

Will the Taoiseach examine the issue?  For example, last week we asked the Taoiseach about his opinion on EU enlargement, which is a matter for the EU Heads of State, but the question was referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade where the Tánaiste——</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_489">There is a deliberate policy of disallowing and transferring questions, which is reducing accountability in the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_490">The two questions I have tabled relate to an important issue, one that was caught in the wider set of questions tabled last week but was not answered.  I want a straight and clear answer as to why the issue identified by the Government from the outset as being its first priority has not been raised in important bilateral meetings, particularly with Prime Minister David Cameron.  Last week, the Taoiseach told me he was leaving the general negotiation on the interest rate to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, because of the eurozone decision of 11 March, but the same excuse cannot be used in respect of bilateral loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_491">If the British Government unilaterally moved to new terms and reduced its interest rate, does the Taoiseach not agree that the hands of other EU governments and Heads of State would be forced to act?  Has the Taoiseach done anything at all to negotiate with, for example, the British to intervene with the French and the Germans in respect of a reduced interest rate?  We have had enough of the Taoiseach's standard reply of recent weeks, namely, "If it comes up, I will raise it".  Last week, the Taoiseach stated he would raise the matter at the European Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_492">In terms of the meetings with the British Prime Minister, it is incredible that the Taoiseach has not raised the issue of the reduced interest rate or enlisted his support for Ireland's case for better terms under the EU-IMF programme, in particular the lower interest rate as agreed by the EU Heads of State as far back as last March.  It is the Government's first priority, yet all of the Taoiseach's actions to date at meetings with the EU Heads of State and at bilateral meetings suggest his focus has been on photo calls and so on, with the dirty and more difficult work being handed to others while he avoids dealing with the crunch issues in the one-to-one meetings with Prime Minister Cameron and others.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_232">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_493">Deputy Martin is wrong in his assertions.  I did of course raise the question of Ireland's IMF-EU-ECB bailout deal with the British Prime Minister and told him of the changes that Ireland was making to comply with the conditions of that deal.  He was favourably disposed towards Ireland and was forthright in his pronouncement that, by and large, the Treasury would be supportive of Ireland's position.  He encouraged bilateral meetings between the Treasury and officials from the Department of Finance and Government.  There is no big mystery.</p>
            <p eId="para_494">The Government of which Deputy Martin was a member negotiated a deal with the IMF and the EU.  That deal has been renegotiated in part by the current Government, which I have the honour to lead.  Agreement was reached at Heads of Government level to devolve responsibility in respect of implementing the principle of an interest rate reduction to the Ministers for Finance.  The Deputy is now suggesting that I take back that responsibility from the Minister for Finance and that I deal with the matter at Heads of Government level.  The Heads of Government of 27 countries agreed this should happen.  I have faith in the Minister for Finance being able to carry out his responsibilities in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">The Deputy asked if my meeting with the British Prime Minister was specifically in relation to the bilateral loan agreement made with Ireland by Britain, Sweden and Denmark.  Were that the case, he would then be asking me why I did not raise the bigger issue of the IMF-EU bailout deal, which has been our priority.  We have recognition of the reduction in principle and a decision that the matter should be dealt with by the Ministers for Finance, who are pursuing it.  Beyond that, we discussed the general principle of where the European Union is headed.  I was supportive of the stance taken by Prime Minister Cameron in his letter, supported by a number of other leaders, about the potential of the European Union Single Market cutting the cost for setting up business, eliminating red tape and bureaucracy and freeing up the trade inter-country so that the EU as a Union could realise its full potential based on the Single Market and be in a position to compete against other trading blocs around the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_496">The relationship between Ireland and Britain and between myself and Prime Minister Cameron is strong.  We will continue to pursue the issue of an interest rate reduction at EU level.  There will be time at a later stage to discuss the specific issue of the bilateral loan.  I might add that Britain has been forthright in saying there will be no further bilateral loans for other countries and made a specific issue of the special relationship between Ireland and Britain based on diaspora, trade and so on.  There is no secret about that.  That was the first meeting we had, short of the usual on the margins meetings at Council meetings and when the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, came to Ireland during the Queen's visit.  We will continue that.</p>

            <p eId="para_497">The Taoiseach said in his formal reply that there was no explicit discussion with the British Prime Minister on the interest rate on the British loan and nor was there intended to be.  I find that revelation incredible.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_235">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
            <p eId="para_499">It would seem to me that the logical and tactically correct strategy would be to seek a reduction on the bilateral loan with Britain as this would force the hand of other EU Heads of State to do likewise on the broader EU-IMF deal.  The Taoiseach has from the outset identified this matter as the Government's number one priority.  On 11 March, the EU Heads of State stated that funding costs should be lowered to better take into account debt sustainability of the recipient countries.  As acknowledged by the Taoiseach last week, that is what was agreed in the communique by the outgoing Government, which was followed through by the current Government.  That is what I find incredible.  This begs the question of whether the Taoiseach as Head of Government has taken this issue as seriously as he should. I do not believe he has done so.  It is no longer good enough to say this is a matter for the Ministers for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">The Taoiseach confirmed this morning that almost half of the bailout funds will not now be subject to any reduction in interest rate.  This was confirmed yesterday by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who said the issue was over-hyped.  It is the Taoiseach and no one else who over-hyped it and made it a red line issue going into EU Council of State meetings.  We now find that at all of the bilateral meetings he had with British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and others, the Taoiseach did not pursue the issue.  When asked if he would raise it at EU Council level he said that if the matter was raised, he would discuss it.</p>
            <p eId="para_501">Will the Taoiseach agree that he has a responsibility and obligation to set and contribute to the setting of the agenda of these EU meetings?  In my view, given it has taken so long to get any meaningful follow through on the meeting of 11 March, it is time the Taoiseach asserted his position at the next EU Heads of State meeting and raised the issue of the sustainability of the programme under which Ireland is working with the EU-IMF, in line with the conclusions arrived at in the EU Heads of State meeting on 11 March.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_236">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_502">Again, I disagree with the Deputy.  When I met the Prime Minister in Downing Street, I thanked him for the bilateral loan from Britain and a number of other countries to Ireland.  I did not go there specifically to seek a reduction in the interest rate on that loan.  I thanked the Prime Minister for the expeditious manner in which his Government, along with Sweden and Denmark, made the bilateral loan available.  We discussed the wider implications of the EU-IMF bailout deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">I accept, as the Deputy stated, that I have particular responsibilities.  The Deputy also asked if I take this matter seriously.  The day after I was appointed Head of Government I attended a meeting in Brussels at which I set out in a serious fashion my priorities.  I told the other leaders present that they were not in attendance as Heads of Government of 40 million, 70 million or 80 million but as equals.  It is my responsibility to defend Ireland's interests in the context of the European Union.  I made the point that the issue of taxation is a matter of national competence and that I would not concede on the matter of an increase in the 12.5% corporate tax rate, which, as the Deputy will be well aware, is being demanded.  I accepted my responsibility and dealt with the issue in a serious manner.  I am not prepared to back down from that.  The IMF, OECD, European Commissioners and Ministers for Finance from other countries are in agreement with our position.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">The Deputy stated that I did not take my responsibilities seriously at that first meeting.  Were that the case, we would be in a different position.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_237">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_238">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_506">I do accept and take seriously my responsibilities.  As I stated previously, as the stress tests on the banks here were not completed prior to the next meeting that responsibility was given to the Ministers for Finance.  That is where the negotiations are now.  The Deputy will be aware that many countries, individuals and organisations outside Europe agree with Ireland's position.</p>
            <p eId="para_507">I understand that in the general discussions that take place at the Heads of Government meeting one can and will contribute.  I do not draw up the agenda myself.  In the context of where Europe is headed, European political leaders should look at how assistance and support can be given and in this regard how schemes can be redesigned, which is a requirement of the ESM.  Europe will have to look at this in the interest of assisting countries and supporting them, which is part of the solidarity principle which is central to the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_508">I did not go to Downing Street looking for an interest rate reduction on the bilateral loan.  It was the first meeting and we discussed a range of issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_509">I thanked the Prime Minister for his support for Ireland.  We will continue to build on those very good relationships.  I expect the issue of the ESM and the progress in Europe's position will of course be central to the Heads of Government meeting this month and I expect to contribute strongly to that.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
            <p eId="para_510">I do not have any sense of urgency from the Taoiseach in regard to this matter.  I never had him chalked down as the shy, retiring, shrinking violet type, so I do not think it was this that led to his failure to raise this matter directly with the British Prime Minister.  The Taoiseach said he discussed the bigger implications of the bailout deal.  Did he discuss the issue of burden sharing, which is the bigger issue here?  The Taoiseach is reluctant, hesitant and slow to make any sort of measurable progress on the interest rate and he refuses, as I see it, to deal with the issue of burden sharing and the core issue of the unsustainability of the debt.  All the while, cutbacks bite and people suffer.  The Taoiseach knows this as well as I do.</p>

            <p eId="para_512">The Taoiseach last week told Irish diplomatic staff to go back to their posts internationally and tell everybody the happy news — not — that the Irish people will continue to bail out bankers, speculators and people who gambled and lost.  He was not shy about setting out that message — a bad message, as far as I am concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_513">At what point, then, does the Taoiseach engage the British Prime Minister and others, not just on the interest rate but on the issue of debt sustainability and the ESM?  As he and I know, Europe clearly envisages debt restructuring, burden sharing and default post-2013.  The danger for us, as the Taoiseach well knows, is that by the time 2013 comes around, the damage done, not just to the economy of this State but to its society and people, will be immense.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_516">It is already on the agenda.  The Government is in court over this because we have taken a decision that there should be burden sharing with subordinated bondholders.  I discussed the question of other burden sharing with Mr. Trichet and, as we have two pillar banks in AIB and Bank of Ireland, the Government decided not to have burden sharing with senior bondholders there.  The ECB recognised Ireland's position and confirmed that, irrespective of downgrading or not, funding would continue to be made available.  I pointed out at all the meetings I have had that Ireland was pursuing burden sharing with subordinated bondholders and there is considerable scope for further savings in that regard.  As the Deputy knows, two court cases were taken, one of which has been withdrawn and I cannot give the Deputy confirmation on the second one as I am speaking here.  The position in so far as Ireland is concerned is that we want to get on with meeting the conditions the country has signed up to in the IMF-EU bailout deal.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">The Deputy referred to the decision of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to call together all of the ambassadors and diplomats from abroad, together with trade personnel, for what was a very successful occasion.  Far from the Deputy's interpretation of it, the message was very clear, namely, this country is open for business, it continues to be an attractive location for foreign direct investment, it continues to have a serious potential in terms of further exports and it will not be changing its 12.5% corporate tax rate.  That clear and positive message has gone out around the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_518">In respect of all of those who work for this country abroad, often in difficult circumstances, we appreciate the efforts they make and we appreciate the continuous commitment they show, beyond normal working hours, on a daily basis in giving evidence to other countries about Ireland's true position.  We have been through adversity before and this is an economic challenge that we will get through.  From that point of view, I differ entirely from the Deputy's interpretation of the outcome of the meeting at which she was not present.</p>

We are measuring up to those commitments and conditions.  The point has been accepted and agreed by practically everybody that an interest rate reduction should be applied here but there is the principle of unanimity, which works both ways.  From that point of view, the Ministers for Finance were given the responsibility, devolved from the Heads of Government, and I have every confidence in our Minister for Finance to conclude that successfully.</p>

            <p eId="para_538">Originally, I stated the deal was bad both for Ireland and for Europe and, from that point of view, renegotiating elements of it would be very important.  That is what has happened.  I reiterate we renegotiated the conditions of the deal to some extent, in respect of the reversal in the minimum wage, no further transfers to NAMA and acceptance of a jobs initiative.  I am sure the Deputy supports all these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_539">The question of interest rate reduction is obviously important and is being pursued by the Ministers for Finance.  I clearly stated that I did not meet the British Prime Minister in order to seek an interest rate reduction in our bilateral loan.  We opted for a first meeting between two Heads of Government, during which we discussed the European question and what Ireland was doing in terms of decisions made about banks, pursuit of subordinated bond investors and our attitude towards Europe.  We thanked the British Government for its support for Ireland's position.  Since then that Government has pointed out it will not make bilateral loans available to other countries as it did to ours because of the connections between Ireland and Britain on an entire range of fronts.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">This work is proceeding and I intend to go to the meeting later this month to articulate very clearly the progress our country has made, the challenge we face and the seriousness with which Europe should approach its responsibilities collectively, as a union.  The Deputy obviously has different views on that but I intend to articulate mine very strongly and clearly on behalf of the Government and the people.</p>

            <p eId="para_542">I asked the Taoiseach the reason he did not raise with the British Prime Minister the issue of the interest rate on the British loan but I do not believe I received a specific answer — nor has anybody else.  I asked the question on the basis that if one believes the interest rate under the EU-IMF programme is too high, as the Taoiseach clearly does, surely he would apply the same logic to the bilateral loan with Britain where the interest rates and premiums are similar.  The logical application of the Taoiseach's thinking on the EU-IMF programme as it applies to the British bilateral loan would be that it also is too high.  Therefore, logically, the Taoiseach should have asked the Prime Minister for a reduction in the interest rate on the same basis we are pursuing a reduction in the interest rate with other Heads of State in the European Union.  That would have had the desired impact of forcing the hands of others to move on this specific issue which goes to the heart of the sustainability of the programme all Heads of Government signed up to on 11 March.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_266">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_543">Deputy Martin was part of an outfit that denied the IMF was in the country and part of a Government that caused a situation where greed, recklessness and lack of accountability resulted in a bailout deal being forced on this country by the IMF, the EU and the ECB because matters could not have continued as they were.  They were out of control.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">That bailout deal was agreed between the Government of which the Deputy was a member and the troika.  The British, Swedish and Danish bilateral deals were not forced on this country in the same fashion as that in which the troika was obliged to act.  My priority, therefore, clearly was, and remains, to deal with that and, in the context of the interest rate reduction, it was the only issue discussed at the meeting of the Heads of Government.  The first person to speak was the Greek Prime Minister, who made a case for a 2% reduction, for a longer period, because of the challenges his country faced.  Following that, there was an agreement in principle that countries in the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, were entitled to an interest rate reduction.  I was not prepared to accept an interest rate reduction on the basis of being obliged to increase the country's corporation tax rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_545">In respect of the conditions attached to the troika bailout, now renegotiated, Ireland measured up on the first assessment.  We are rightly in pursuit of the principle accepted by the heads of government that there should be an interest rate reduction for the countries in the EFSF bailout situation.  In that context, the IMF came to Ireland as part of that troika — with the resulting outcome.  That situation was different from the bilateral loan arrangement offered by Britain, Sweden and Denmark which was not forced on the country.  My priority was, and remains, to deal with the interest rate and gain improvements in the IMF-EU bailout.  We spoke with the British Government and will continue to do so on a very regular basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_551">We can take some solace that this was really what the Taoiseach means, now that subordinated bondholders are being burned and Deputy Brian Lenihan's policy is being acted upon.  However, the real issue, the core of my question, concerns a serious allegation.  The Taoiseach's speech did not mention this — it was clearly decided not to mention it — namely, that the United States Administration intervened to stop Ireland moving against certain senior bank bondholders last year.  Given that this was not mentioned in the Taoiseach's speech, in his discussion with the President about the speech, or elsewhere, is it the Taoiseach's official position that he has no intention of asking President Obama about this allegation which has been in circulation for some weeks?  Did the Taoiseach ask President Obama about the assertion concerning Mr. Timothy Geithner's intervention to stop Ireland from burning bank bondholders?  What happened at the meeting in that regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_554">I was not aware of this allegation when I met Mr. Geithner in Washington.  As the Deputy knows, this was not referred to, either in the speech of welcome I made to the President or in his speech, which spoke for itself.  We discussed with him the corporate tax rate in this country, the issue of the undocumented Irish, the need for action on that here and the President's response on immigration and the different elements in regard to different diasporas in the United States, a matter in which he has an interest.  Those items were discussed but I did not have any detailed discussions as to whether Mr. Geithner made the comments he is alleged to have made in an article by Professor Morgan Kelly.  I have no evidence of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_555">Did the Taoiseach ask the President to outline his views on the burning of senior bank bondholders?  It is a simple question.  This question does not apply to Ireland alone — it applies to the eurozone and across the globe.  It is a simple and straightforward question.  When the Taoiseach met President Obama, he had an opportunity to raise this fundamental issue and to ascertain the views of the US Administration on a policy initiative that could be to the advantage and benefit of Ireland.  The initiative in question is being discussed following the leaking of a letter written by the German Finance Minister on the restructuring of Greek debt.  A pattern seems to be developing.  When the Taoiseach meets people like Prime Minister Cameron or President Obama, he avoids asking hard questions or raising awkward issues.  Such meetings seem to be about backslapping, getting the old photo calls right and getting the optics right.  I do not get a sense that the core issues that were identified by the Taoiseach — burning the bank bondholders, getting the interest rate reduced and bringing sustainability to recovery programmes within the eurozone — have been raised in a substantial or fundamental way when the Taoiseach has met key people in recent months.  That is why I am surprised the Taoiseach did not ask President Obama to outline his views on the burning of senior bank bondholders.</p>

We have discussed the ECB's position on burden sharing with Mr. Trichet and with politicians and finance ministers from all of those countries.  We have now arrived at a position where subordinated bondholders are contributing.  As I said earlier, a case before the courts at the moment will determine whether the Minister for Finance can continue to do that.  Our bailout agreement is with the ECB, the IMF and the EU.  The European Commission and the IMF favour the position Ireland has adopted.  We are locked into a position, but we are negotiating a reduction in the interest rate and continued improvements in the deal.  I do not deal in assertions, frankly.  I do not know the truth or otherwise of the allegation Professor Kelly has made.  I will raise it with Mr. Geithner the next time I see him.  The last time I met him, I was not aware of the assertion in the article in question.  We will continue to focus on our priority, which is securing an improvement in the deal and an acceptance of the principle of an interest rate reduction.</p>

If it had been accepted, we would be talking about a lesser burden of €20 billion.  Apparently, such a proposal was being discussed at the time of Mr. Geithner's alleged intervention.  It would have made a difference of €20 billion to the Irish people.  Given that it would have funded 100 of the Government's jobs initiatives, it would have alleviated this country's unemployment crisis.  The Taoiseach is telling us that he did not raise the matter with President Obama.  He seems completely uninterested in whether this allegation is true.</p>

We are trying to improve our export position, which is very strong at the moment.  We want to continue to trade our way out of these difficulties and get our people back to work.

            <p eId="para_583">It is said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  I am sure the Taoiseach's homage to the US President was appreciated, albeit with nothing like the utter gratitude of Fianna Fáil for the Government's pursuit of its policy agenda.  I am more interested in what the Taoiseach might have told President Obama about his attitude to burning senior bondholders.  I pursued the Taoiseach this morning on the matter of burden sharing.  He referred consistently to "subordinated bondholders", but what about senior bondholders?  I mentioned this morning that senior, unsecured and unguaranteed bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank were paid in full last week for a €200 million bond.  How can he defend that?  The bonds in question were unguaranteed and unsecured.  Given the circumstances we are in, why in the name of any kind of logic or decency is the Government allowing that debt to be met?  What did the Taoiseach tell the US President?  I hope it was not the same message he gave the diplomatic corps and staff and the world at large, which was that the world is all right with Ireland and we will meet all of these debts.  That is not acceptable.</p>

            <p eId="para_588">In return for that, the ECB made it perfectly clear that regardless of whether there is downgrading, it will continue to provide funding for Ireland.  That was a very important statement about our economic strength in its own right.  As the Deputy is aware, Anglo Irish Bank was not involved in the strenuous stress tests that were carried out initially.  I have made clear that bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank are in a different category than those in what are the two pillar banks arising from the Government's decisiveness in dealing with a situation where there were six dysfunctional banks and no capacity to either lend or extend credit to small and medium enterprises for the creation of jobs and opportunities.  From that point of view, I gave the US President a clear rundown on where Ireland is in terms of meeting our challenge and how we continue to renegotiate to have improvements and follow the principle agreed of a reduction in interest rates.</p>

            <p eId="para_589">Whether the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, did or did not make the particular remarks is not the issue.  The fact is that the issue was flagged.  As the Taoiseach's borrowed rhetoric in College Green soared to lofty heights, and no doubt he was concentrating on that, he also was looking at tens of thousands of citizens, the victims of the financial crisis.  Should it have occurred to the Taoiseach to raise with the President of the United States, whose economic power stretches into all areas of the globe including the International Monetary Fund, the principle of whether the people of a state such as this should be forced to carry the burden for the failed gambles of European banks and whether the United States — as, the Taoiseach states, a friendly country — should support the people of a small state in asserting they have no responsibility to carry the bad debts of failed gamblers?</p>

The two words that came through to me in the many thousands of messages I received were "respect" and "pride" in our Irishness and in ourselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">The American President recognises very well the challenge that Ireland faces and made comments about the scale of the challenge that his own country faces and was forthright in his public support for Ireland — Deputy Joe Higgins will recall his words to that effect — and that continues.  During our conversation, I referred deliberately to the strong connections between Ireland and the United States, to the strong ongoing connections in foreign direct investment here and, indeed, to Irish investment in the United States where, through 40 states, there are 80,000 Americans employed in Irish-owned companies.  In that regard, the extent of trade both ways across the Atlantic, both between Ireland and the United States and between Europe and the United States, continues to grow and we want to see that happening.</p>

            <p eId="para_592">On subordinated debt about which the Taoiseach made play this morning, the bottom line is that is made possible by legislation brought in by the outgoing Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that the Taoiseach trenchantly opposed at the time, but matters have changed and the Taoiseach is implementing that.  The issue is the senior debt.  In terms of the Taoiseach's meeting with President Obama, irrespective of what United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, may have said, there is a fundamental issue about ascertaining the attitude of the US Administration towards restructuring senior debt or burning senior bank bondholders.  It is incredible that the Taoiseach did not raise that issue with the US President and seek his perspective on it, given the significant influence of the US Administration on global economic affairs.  In terms of the canvas for the appointment of the new senior official in the IMF, we understand the influence of the United States on the outcome of the competition for that post.  It is extraordinary and incredible that on what the Taoiseach identified during and after the election, and when he came into Government, as the most serious issue, that is, restructuring debt and dealing with senior bank bondholders, he clearly has abandoned any commitment to getting that sorted——</p>

          <from>Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Departments of An Taoiseach and Defence (Deputy Paul Kehoe)</from>
          <p eId="para_786">The Central Statistics Office, CSO, is responsible for the collection, processing and publication of official statistics on economic, social and general conditions in the State.  While the main focus is to meet the statistical requirements of Government, there is a very wide community of users of statistics, both national and international.  Statistics are used by Departments and public bodies, by business, universities, research institutes and the general public.  Indeed, members of the public are increasingly aware of the key statistics and indicators concerning the economic and social issues which affect their daily lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">International organisations, notably the Commission, the IMF and the OECD, are also important users of statistics.  The CSO must comply with an extensive body of European legislation on statistics; the majority of surveys are required by EU regulations and these demands are increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">International organisations also have a significant role in defining standards for the compilation of comparable information and in setting quality standards and principles for the governance of official statistics.  In this regard, the CSO subscribes to the standards set out in the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the European Statistics Code of Practice.  Net expenditure by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in 2010 amounted to €50,762,000.  The 2011 net allocation is €80,067,000.  This is an increase of 58%, the reason for the increase being the census of population which is undertaken every five years.  As Deputies will be aware census day was on 10 April.  Almost all of the census collection costs have been incurred in the first half of the year.  The Central Fund Act 1965 limits Departments to spending no more than four fifths of the previous year's allocation in anticipation of the Department's Vote being passed by the Dáil.  The need to discharge the outstanding census field payments now, mainly the balance of the fees due to enumerators, makes it necessary to put the Vote before the House in advance of those for other Departments and Offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">More than 5,300 temporary field staff were employed by the CSO to conduct the census field operation.  During the course of the operation they delivered and collected more than 1.6 million census forms.  Their work has been successfully completed and I thank and commend all the census field staff on their effort and dedication in conducting census 2011.  Final payments to the census field staff are being issued this week and the motion will enable the CSO to fulfil its commitments to these staff and to continue with the rest of its statistical work programme throughout the remainder of 2011.  The CSO aims to publish the preliminary results of the census at the end of June.  These results will provide population summaries by gender, for each county and electoral district, as well as providing benchmark data on net migration in the five years since the last census in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">During the next six months the CSO will scan and code the census forms, which amount to more than 20 million pages of information.  The first detailed census results will be published in March 2012, less than one year after census day.  The programme of census reports will include nine thematic releases containing tables, maps, interpretation and analysis.  Detailed on-line tables and small-area statistics will be produced.  The exact timetable and details of the census publication programme will be announced on the CSO website in September this year.  While the census is the CSO's largest project, the office has an extensive ongoing work programme and publishes in excess of 300 statistical releases and publications every year.  Results from the latest household budget survey will be published later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Initial results from the June 2010 census of agriculture were published in March and a detailed county report on farming will be published in 2012.  The CSO compiles our most important economic indicators, which receive close scrutiny in the present climate.  For example, it will publish the quarter one figures on the labour market and on national income later this month.  Monthly indicators such as the consumer price index and the retail sales index will receive close attention from economic commentators and from the public at large.  The CSO's newest reports also reflect current policy priorities.  These include the residential property price index series, which was published in May; the last release on foreign nationals' PPSN allocations, employment and social welfare activity, also issued in May; and the CSO's job churn analysis, which provides an on-line visual and tabular presentation of the changes in employment in each sector of the economy.  These three reports were all based on existing administrative data sources.  They illustrate the potential to provide statistical insight using administrative data and to produce new statistics without increasing the burden on data providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The CSO is taking a comprehensive approach to reducing the burden on business of providing statistics.  This involves the re-design of questionnaires, the reduction of sample sizes and greater integration of data from existing sources.  By taking this approach, the CSO reduced the statistical burden on businesses by 7.3% in 2009.  A similar reduction is being achieved this year.  One of the key initiatives to reduce the burden in 2011 is a reduction in the number of small enterprises which are being surveyed in the annual services inquiry.  Instead of sending questionnaires to these firms, the necessary information will be estimated by the CSO from Revenue data.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Similarly, the annual June and December surveys of agriculture now require less form-filling than before because information on cattle and cereals is obtained directly by the CSO from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The overall approach is in line with the National Statistics Board's Strategy for Statistics 2009-2014, which places a strong emphasis on the overall Irish statistical system and on realising the statistical potential of administrative records.  The CSO is working closely with other Departments and agencies to help support the effective use of statistics to inform policy.  In this regard statistics have an important role to play in promoting evidence-informed decision making and in monitoring policy outcomes.  I expect that a climate of greater accountability and preference management in the public service will increase the demand for statistical information.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Finally, the number of staff in the CSO's Vote for 2011 is 850.  This compares with 767 in 2010.  Under the employment control framework, the permanent staffing of the CSO will reduce to 725 in 2012, after the census processing is finalised, and to 700 by 2014.  Like all Departments and offices, the CSO must meet the challenges of public service reform.  The office has fully delivered on all its commitments for savings under the McCarthy report and the Croke Park agreement and is implementing a programme of continual improvement to meet the challenges ahead.  As I stated at the outset, I thank all the staff of the CSO, including the 5,300 field staff who collected the census forms, for a job well done so far.  I look forward to seeing the results of their work when the preliminary results are published by the CSO at the end of this month.  I commend the Estimate to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_339">
          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_795">I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the motion, a Revised Estimate for the CSO for €80 million for the current year.  We support the Revised Estimate and it is necessary that this is done.  I am keen to ensure there are no difficulties with the matter.  The reason the Revised Estimate is so large this year is because the census was held on 10 April.  Excellent work was carried out by the 5,300 enumerators and all the supervisory and control staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">I am pleased that the Minister of State has indicated that the preliminary returns will be announced by the end of this month.  Based on previous Supreme Court judgments this will immediately commence the process of a review of constituency boundaries to take account of the changing populations.  At that stage I expect the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, will set up a new Constituency Commission and will probably call on it to set the number of new Deputies in the order of 150 after the next election.  That is approximately where he is going on the issue.  This is only one side product of the Revised Estimates and the census process.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The Deputy's statement was informative in a way and it gives us a good brief on the CSO but it does not deal with the real issue of why we are here today.  The question must be asked why we are passing this single Revised Estimate today.  The reason must be seen in the context of the fact that the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2011 was published six months ago.  Since the general election the new Government has made no effort whatever to bring the Estimates before the Dáil or to have them passed by the Dáil.  Now, we are midway through the month of June, almost half way through the year.  The Government has shown contempt for the new Dáil by not bringing any of the Estimates for any Department before the House to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">There has been talk of Dáil reform.  The Government's idea of Dáil reform is to diminish the role of the Dáil, the role of Members, including the Government backbenchers, and the Opposition.  The announcement today by the Government of the setting up of new committees is unsatisfactory.  For the first time I imagine no member of the Opposition will be allowed to chair a direct line Department committee.  That is unprecedented.  Members of the Opposition will be given the Chairs outside of direct line Ministries, whether it is the traditional PAC role or Committee on Members' Interests role or something like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The Book of Estimates as passed in the budget last year was for €57 billion of expenditure this year.  Approximately €25 billion — a conservative reckoning — of that €57 billion has already been spent this year by the various Departments without any approval by this Chamber.  Deputy Mathews will surely agree that the concept of a business going halfway through its financial year before approving its budget for the year is so absurd as to be incomprehensible.  There has been no discussion with the Whips as to the timetabling of the Estimates, but I have no doubt guillotines will be used before the summer recess to ensure they are completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The €80 million allocation for the CSO out of a total Estimate for the entire year for all Departments of €57 billion equates to some €1 in every €700 that will be spent by the Government this year.  Why is Dáil approval being sought today for this one Vote?  It is indicative of the shambles into which the Government has led itself.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_804">We are in a shambolic situation.  In less than 36 hours' time, 5,300 enumerators are due to be paid for the field work they did in conducting the census.  That money will have to be in their bank accounts by Friday, according to the Minister of State's note, which means it must be transferred at five minutes after midnight on Thursday night if it is being done by electronic transfer.  It would be illegal for anybody in the payroll section of the CSO to press the button to arrange those transfers before the Dáil approves the Estimate today.  The Minister of State has brought this to the wire and has shown a complete disregard for public servants.  There are less than 36 hours to ensure these people are paid, and they will not be if this Estimate is not approved.  That is why I support the motion.  This is an example of incompetent management.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Today will go down as an historic day because it is the day the Government has been found out.  We have seen the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance walking away from the negotiations on a 1% reduction in the interest rate on the EU-IMF deal.  That is their handling of the macro debate.  In regard to the micro debate, the Government has shown contempt for public servants, for the Estimates process and for the Dáil by not ensuring this particular Estimate was agreed sooner.  The Minister of State is doing a fire brigade job today with only 36 hours left.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sean Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_807">I suspect the Minister of State had no concept that these payments had to be paid in 36 hours' time.  His persistent interruptions suggest he is not on top of the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">Another issue is the Government's proposals regarding the establishment of Oireachtas committees whereby no Opposition Member will chair any direct-line departmental committee.  To reiterate, the Government's decision at the macro level on the 1% interest rate reduction on the bailout has fallen apart today; the micro-level handling of this particular Estimate whereby the Minister of State has pushed it to the wire and almost blown it means our consent is required today in order to ensure public service staff are paid this Friday;  and the Government's contempt for the Dáil in rushing through the setting up of committees without any Opposition agreement in regard to membership and chairmanship is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">This is the Government's 91st day in office and we can all expect a major public relations spin soon with claims of how wonderfully it has performed in its first 100 day.  However, the cracks are beginning to show.  The Government is entitled to its honeymoon period, but the Queen and President Obama have come and gone and the glow is beginning to wear off.  From now on the Government is on its own.  It can continue to blame the outgoing Administration for all these decisions, but we are not responsible for the Government's election promise that it would negotiate a 1% reduction in the interest rate on the bailout, which it has failed to do.  We are not responsible for the fact that the Government is making a hames of setting up committees and has allowed no Opposition input.  These are the Government's decisions and actions, not ours.  It is not our fault that the payment of staff at the CSO has been brought to the wire and that an emergency motion is required.</p>

          <p eId="para_818">My main concern is that we should learn from this debacle and review the situation where retired people rather than the long-term unemployed are engaged as enumerators.  The census offers an opportunity to get people off the dole for one, two or even three months.  It is a pity we are down to the wire in regard to the remuneration of those people who took part in gathering the 1.6 million census forms.  They should have been paid much sooner.  There is also an issue in that the tender for the gathering and compilation of census data was given to a United States company based in Britain which has a dubious history.  However, my colleague will deal with that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">I hope lessons are learned too in terms of the wording of census questions, some of which we still have not got right.  For example, many people were upset by the question which asked female respondents about the number of children born alive to them.  This means women who have had stillbirths are not included in the data.  Society has moved on from the situation in the past and such births are now registered and funerals are conducted for these infants.  We must be careful about how this question is worded in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The plan to publish the details of the 1926 census later this year is welcome and they will be a great tool for historians and for anybody interested in their family history.  However, a difficulty may arise from the decision to release this information before 100 years have lapsed, as is the usual practice, in that it may discourage people from providing accurate information in future censuses.  In other words, the release of historical census data ahead of schedule has consequences today.  In that context, I urge that the 1936 census not be released before 2036.  There is a concern that personal information may be released at a future date which might cast some type of aspersion on people still living.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">I welcome the announcement that the full data from the 2011 census will be published by the end of March next year.  It is vital that we get the statistics early, especially in this changing climate, so that policy can be properly planned.  I urge the Government to review the data as quickly as possible so that we can get our social policy right and plan our economy into the future.  The preliminary data will be available at the end of June and must be reviewed over the summer as part of the planning for budget 2012.  These data will help us to understand the scale of poverty in society and to see what changes have happened since the last census.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Finally, in the event that we have not changed to having an electoral register based on PPS numbers when future censuses are taken, I urge that the opportunity presented by people calling to each house in the country be used to induce people to fill out another form to ensure everyone is on the electoral register.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_355">
          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
          <p eId="para_823">The census process undoubtedly is of critical importance to the people and to those of us who seek change for good in society and who rely heavily on its findings in respect of unemployment rates, income levels and so on across the counties and regions of this State.  Consequently, it is a project of critical importance that is undertaken periodically.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">However, I am strongly of the view that the project was undermined this time.  Information has come into the public domain concerning one of the private companies that assisted the CSO with this census.  While I acknowledge it has assisted the CSO in the past, this information has only now come to light.  I refer to the private company CACI UK, which was awarded a contract worth €5.8 million to assist the CSO in a number of roles pertaining to the undertaking of the census.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">In respect of CACI, I refer to hundreds of torture victims from Iraq who were forced to endure Abu Ghraib and all Members are familiar with both the scandal there and the images sent around the world.  CACI, the parent company based in America, is before the United States federal courts, having been taken to court by hundreds of victims.  Moreover, their case is supported by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a group established in the 1960s by those who are campaigning for civil rights in the United States.  Members will recall those campaigns for the rights of black people in America, involving people such as Martin Luther King and many others who we celebrate here in Ireland in particular.  The aforementioned civil rights organisation is supporting the hundreds of victims who are taking a case against the very company that worked on the Irish census.  This constitutes an absolute shame on our people and the Government has ignored this because this point has been put to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">I refer to another company with which, sadly, Ireland has a relationship, called L-3 Integrated Systems, which also is being taken to court in America for its alleged involvement in acts in Iraq.  This company has aeroplanes that fly through Shannon Airport and two of which, with registration numbers N475LC and N478GS, are regular visitors to Shannon Airport.  Therefore, one must ask serious questions about the approach being taken by this State on two levels.  This concerns private companies that were involved in heinous acts and which have been taken to court both by the alleged victims and by reputable and highly respected groups that protect citizens' rights in America.</p>

          <p eId="para_828">Very well, I will wrap up fairly quickly.  A critical point in this regard is that the Pentagon itself conducted an inquiry into the Abu Ghraib affair, which had a devastating impact on the Americans' efforts in Iraq at the time.  The resulting report found against CACI personnel and stated they were involved in the abuse of prisoners, had not been properly trained, had lied to investigators and were incompetent.  This information is contained in the Pentagon's own report.  I tabled a question to the Taoiseach in April on this issue and received a response from the Government and the CSO.  It stated that CACI UK Limited, which is a subsidiary of the group that allegedly is responsible for these heinous crimes, and which the United States Pentagon considers to be responsible for them, presented the best value for money.  Is this how standards now are assessed in Ireland?  Is it the case that we do not care about the reputation of a private company which gains access potentially to highly sensitive information on behalf of the people and which possibly could pass on such information to external intelligence services for whatever purpose?  Is it the case that we have no concern about the damage to our reputation caused by this?  I cannot let the motion under discussion pass without putting this on the record.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">When asked to speak publicly on this issue, I have called on the people to fill out their census forms.  I did not wish to undermine the census project because it is of critical importance.  While I acted in good faith, I call on the Government and the CSO, now this project has been completed, to ensure this State never again employs a company to carry out critical work on behalf of the people that has any connection to human rights abuses at any time.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_360">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_831">If, as expected, the Dáil decides to pass this motion to grant the CSO access to these funds, the Dáil and the Government in particular must take responsibility for the information the State effectively is buying.  There must be immediate action in respect of service planning and provision because what is the point of this exercise otherwise?  I also wish to put on record that I am fully supportive of a five-year census.  I often have made good use of census data in the past to demonstrate inequity in service provision and in particular for those areas in which there has been rapid population expansion.  While the work was well organised and carried out diligently by the enumerators, I share the concerns regarding the aforementioned company that received the contract.  However, this information is important and has a wide application.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The information provided by the census is time-dependent and must be collected, collated and used because with each day, week or month that passes, the information becomes further out of date and as a result, timing is of great importance for service provision.  A strong example of the State's sluggishness in using the census results occurred when the decision was made at some point not to use the preliminary figures to commence the redrawing of constituencies.  I recall making this argument strongly in the Dáil in 2006, because a timing issue had arisen between the five-year term of the Dáil and the census figures.  At that time, I was informed by the then Minister, Dick Roche, that it would be illegal to use the preliminary figures.  This response annoyed me to such an extent that together with Deputy Finian McGrath, I took a constitutional case in which it was established that it was in the common good to institute the redrawing of constituencies on the basis of the preliminary figures.  This is what will happen, with the final decision being confirmed by the results.  Previously, the timing of elections had meant there was an inequity in that some areas were under-represented while others were over-represented for protracted periods, with the result that each vote was not equal.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">While that was one aspect pertaining to representation, other areas also are important.  I believe fundamentally that it is necessary to plan, which is the reason the census is an important vehicle.  Expensive advertisements were rightly used to encourage people to fill out their census forms.  The message contained therein was the information needed to plan for transport, health care, education, the requisite number of housing units and so on.  However, while a broad range of information is gathered, there is little evidence that such information is used effectively.  If one considers the education system, anyone who has been involved in politics for a number of years at local government or national level will be aware that when one reaches this time of year, school principals in some schools must suddenly wonder how they will provide accommodation for their incoming pupil numbers.  Where is the evidence the census is used to fully plan for this?  One can only overlay a census on a good system, which shows the chaos underneath or the lack of a coherent system.  This illustrates the need for a reform of the system to make it more rational.  For example, a need for an extra school or classrooms involves a lengthy process that is more concerned with the filtering of annual funding than it is about being an effective system for delivering schools and classrooms.  For instance, no longer can the number of baptisms in an area be relied upon as a means of knowing how many children will require primary school places because many people do not practice religion or are of mixed faiths so the census in this instance becomes even more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The health care system requires a coherent system for gathering information on the age profile of the population as older people are more dependent on it.  Our health system consists of a public and a private sector, a public health care system with a private element to it and a private voluntary health care system.  The politics on how services are delivered mitigates against delivering adequate services and best value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">In the planning system, land use and planning are not linked.  If the census statistics had been used to estimate the number of households we might have avoided the situation whereby there is an over-supply of houses and houses in locations where nobody wants to live, and ghost estates.  This is a consequence of a lack of planning and of not using the figures gathered in the census to provide for adequate planning.  We will all pay a very high price and in particular, my generation, my children and my grandchildren will pay.  It is important to make appropriate use of the census information.  If we do not plan where people live, we cannot plan for how they will get to work and leisure activities.  We lack the ability to plan and to link the appropriate information such as the census information to the planning of services.  We need to use these figures in a timely manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">I disagree with the views of Deputy Ó Snodaigh with regard to the 1926 census.  I believe he would probably agree that this census is different because we do not have the benefit of a census in 1921 as a consequence of the War of Independence.  There is a significant gap between the census of 1911 and that of 1926.  The bulk of the census returns from the 19th century were destroyed because of a lack of paper during the Great War and also because of the burning of the Public Records Office in the early days of the Civil War.  The 1926 census returns should be released although I would find favour with Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point about the 1936 census because this was held in more normal circumstances whereas the 1926 census was out of kilter because of the historical time and the absence of a census in 1921.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Paul Kehoe)</from>
          <p eId="para_837">I thank Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Mac Lochlainn and Catherine Murphy for remaining in the Chamber until the completion of the debate.  I am amazed that a member of the opposite Fianna Fáil party would make serious allegations and then run out of the Chamber like a little rat.  That is the only way I can describe it because I am amazed at the accusations he made.  It was his party that made the original Estimate for the CSO and still he comes in here and makes accusations.  He did not even speak on the motion about Dáil reform, the fact that the Opposition was granted the chairing of committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">To address the comments from some of the Members opposite, Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked whether people on social welfare could be employed as census field workers.  I also inquired about this possibility when I was in opposition.  However, having spoken to the Central Statistics Office, I was informed that this possibility was explored but any recruitment procedure for positions must be open and transparent to all.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Both Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of CACI.  This matter of the confidentiality of the census returns has been raised in the House on a number of occasions.  I can assure both Deputies that all returns are completely confidential.  The company, CACI, was employed to carry out work in 2002, 2006 and 2011.  I can assure the Deputies that all the information gathered in the recent census is completely confidential and will remain so.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about the census question regarding the number of children born alive.  This question was agreed by the census advisory group.  The purpose of the question is to measure fertility and to assist the forecasting of population changes over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Deputy Ó Snodaigh also asked about access to the 1926 census records.  The Statistics Act 1993 provides that no census information can be released prior to 100 years and a change in legislation would be required to enable such release.  I believe this provision should remain and no information should be released prior to 100 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Deputy Catherine Murphy raised a number of issues and she differed with Deputy Ó Snodaigh's view on the 1926 census records.  She spoke about the need for planning for the future and the importance of census information in this regard.  I agree with her view.  I attended the most recent board meeting of the CSO and I encourage Departments and Ministers to use the information gathered by the CSO because such information is invaluable, accurate and wide-ranging and would be of benefit when preparing Government policies.  I am aware that most Departments and Ministers make use of the CSO information when formulating Government policy.  The range of information in the CSO is second to none and it should be used more frequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">I note the planning and work involved in the design of the census return forms and in the phrasing of the questions, for instance, with regard to intellectual disability and other disabilities.  I welcome the contributions of the Members opposite.  I thank them and commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_846">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Before I go into its details, let us remind ourselves that those on welfare did not cause the economic crisis and should never have to suffer its consequences.  It is a red line issue and I urge all Deputies to put their concerns at the top of the political agenda.  People with a disability, pensioners, the unemployed and the sick have to be protected.  My job is to do that and I will fight to the end to defend and protect the weaker sections of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">I agree with some aspects of the Bill, in particular the restoration of the minimum wage and some of the proposals on job creation.  These are positive elements. The core issue in this debate is job creation and let us be straight with our people.  Economic growth with social inclusion is the way forward and should be part of the broader debate on this Bill.  Is the Minister aware that a senior United Nations expert has criticised the Government policy of making deep cuts to public expenditure while maintaining low taxes and stated it would hit the poorest hardest in the recession?</p>
          <p eId="para_848">The expert, who was appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council, has also called on European Union member states to reduce the interest rate charged on Ireland's EU-IMF loan, warning that failure to do so may leave them in breach of their international legal obligations.  Dr. Magdalena Carmona is the United Nations independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty.  She conducted a visit to Ireland and in a report to the United Nations she concluded that the economic and financial crises have wrought havoc on the country with grave implications for the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The report states that unemployment is rising and increasing numbers of people are living in poverty and social exclusion and that the impact of the crisis has been severe, particularly for the most vulnerable sections of society.  It is also very critical of Governments for seeking to reduce the budget deficit by imposing a deep cuts in public spending while maintaining a low tax regime.  It is likely to have a major impact on the most vulnerable in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Reductions in public expenditure affected the poorest and most vulnerable with the most severity, whereas some increase in taxation rates could place the burden on those who are better equipped to cope, the report states.  It notes that Ireland has one of the lowest levels of taxation in the European Union.  I note in the debate on this Bill that taxation is always a bad word.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The report is also very critical of the universal social charge and points out that human rights are not an optional policy to be dispensed with during times of economic hardship.  It is therefore vital that Ireland immediately undertakes a human rights review of all budgetary and recovery policies and ensures that they comply with human rights principles.  This should be part of the debate on this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">In regard to the details of the Bill, its purpose is to give legislative effect to the restoration of the national minimum wage to its previous level, something which I welcome and strongly support.  I voted against the previous Government on that issue.  Section 2 contains changes to the social welfare code arising from the jobs initiative announced on 10 May 2011.  Economic growth, combined with social inclusion and jobs, has to be part of the strategy to get us out of this mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">There are also changes to social welfare arising from the EU-IMF programme of financial support for Ireland, which I mentioned.  There are provisions to strengthen certain control measures and to facilitate the transfer of the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">We did not seem to have a detailed debate on the section dealing with pensions.  People should have the right to retire from their jobs, particularly if they work in a very difficult job, but I am not of the view that people should stop working at 65 years of age.  Many senior citizens make a massive positive contribution to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">I am very concerned about taking discretion away from community welfare officers.  It is a dangerous situation because it will remove the safety net from the poorer sections of society.  It is very important that this issue is highlighted and protected.  As I said at the start of my contribution, those on welfare and pensioners did not cause this crisis and should not be penalised in any way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_856">I am delighted to have an opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  I want to record my opposition to its guillotining today at 7 p.m.  We have been told this is because of the diktat from the EU and the IMF but it is much more in line with the current Government's takeover, hook, line and sinker, of the policies and methods of operation of the previous Government.  I remind the Government and Minister that in the course of the general election campaign and since we have been told time and again that the guillotine would not be used and that there would be Dáil reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">However, when it comes to a Bill such as this, which is very important and contains intricate sections, we find that totally inadequate time has been given to it.  There should be an open ended discussion on it and I am sorry to see that it is being rammed through with very short notice and without adequate discussion.  In a Bill such as this introduced by a Labour Parity Minister I would have expected to see reversals in social welfare cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">In the recent general election, Labour Party candidates up and down the country were telling the electorate that if it was in government, it would reverse the cuts.  Its candidates were on every local radio station saying the same thing.  They indicated in particular that cuts to the carer's allowance would be reversed, which of course has not happened.  The same happened in regard to the universal social charge.  Both cuts have impacted significantly on the lower paid, carers and middle-income families.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">I hope, even at this late stage, that the Government and Minister would reverse the cuts, in particular, the universal social charge and the cuts to the carer's allowance.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_861">I have changed the way in which the Department of Education and Skills will respond to questions.  From now on, replies will be brief and to the point.  This has been done to provide time for more questions to be answered and Deputies to ask more supplementary questions if they so wish.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">The intention of the sustainability study to be undertaken by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, at my request is to assess the inter-relationship and tension between objectives for increasing student numbers in higher education, maintaining and improving quality and managing within overall funding constraints.  The purpose of undertaking this work is to ensure that realistic and sustainable levels of growth in numbers can be supported and better informed choices can be made on policy options for future funding.  In assessing this, the HEA has also been asked to consider the impact of more effective utilisation of existing resources, including through the potential of contractual changes under the Croke Park agreement.  It will also draw on international comparisons and benchmarks in its work.  While the overall study is a complex exercise, I have asked for preliminary findings by the autumn.   The precise terms of reference are being finalised and will be published when agreed.</p>

            <p eId="para_863">I thank the Minister for his innovative approach to answering questions.  We have all experienced cases of Ministers reading out only half of a prepared reply because it was excessively long.  I look forward to having a good dialogue with the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">In his recent address to the Royal Irish Academy the Minister referred to the major challenges facing the education system arising from demographical change and, thankfully, the continued increase in the number of people participating in and accessing third level education.  He also spoke fluently about improvements in the educational profile, the global rankings Irish universities have achieved through good management and significant investment of resources in recent years.  Retention rates and the quality of courses are also good.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">The Minister stated some months ago that the Hunt report needed to be dealt with urgently.  According to the report, the third level sector urgently requires additional funding of approximately €500 million per annum.  Why is the Government not acting on its recommendations?  Is this not a case of kicking to touch another report?  What additional benefits will the new report the Minister has requested from the Higher Education Authority bring to the debate?</p>

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_368" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_866">The section on finance in the Hunt report called for further detailed analysis and study.  In addition, the increase in funding of approximately €500 million is required over a lengthy period as opposed to the next couple of years.  There are levels of duplication emerging which were not previously known.  For example, approximately 40 different courses are offered in second level education teacher training in 21 different institutions.  We must examine not so much institutional rearrangement, although that may be necessary should the institutions so decide, but the duplication of existing courses in centres that are in close proximity to each other.  There is no doubt that net additional money will be required for third level education.  Some of this funding could be found from savings within existing expenditure.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
            <p eId="para_867">The Minister referred to the need for better utilisation of existing resources.  Does he mean human resources, personnel and the range of teaching facilities available at different colleges?  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, will be familiar with a particular project with which he and I were associated in the past, namely, an alliance between Teagasc and University College Cork which delivers better utilisation and synergy in the delivery of courses and the drawing down of external funding, specifically from the European Union.</p>

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_370" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_868">By the end of the second decade of this century we will have to examine how we can get much more with less, in particular, how we can utilise distance learning and online participation through different institutions offering the same type of online activities.  For example, County Meath Vocational Education Committee has developed a system of teaching applied mathematics from a single centre across the various second level VEC schools in the county.  I recently visited Longwood VEC school which has, with the consent and co-operation of parents, supplied students with iPads in which all the books and written material they require are available electronically.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">Given the resource constraints we face and with which the Deputy is more than familiar, we must find new ways of delivering as well as economies within the system.  I do not wish to convey the impression that we can fund the additional growth through internal economies and innovations alone.  We must find additional net resources, which is what I have asked the Higher Education Authority to identify.</p>

This is a practical option as it facilitates students who wish to work during the day and may not always be able to travel.  Do the terms of reference for the HEA's study include the possibility of reintroducing student fees?</p>

            <p eId="para_873">The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, issued a circular to schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011-12 school year.  A key feature of the scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of special needs assistant, SNA, support to eligible schools.  The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to it by 18 March 2011.  It intends to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible.  I am advised by the NCSE that it is not aware of any widespread difficulties being experienced by parents of children with special needs seeking to enrol children for the coming school year as a result of this measure.  It further advises that in the event that any such issues arise they can be raised directly with the special educational needs organiser, SENO.  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school refuses to enrol a student.</p>

            <p eId="para_874">When I raised a similar question with a Minister previously he indicated he would examine the matter.  He states the National Council for Special Education has not encountered widespread difficulties in this regard.  The difficulty faced by families is that they must go from one school to another.  I have been contacted by the parents of three children with dyslexia who are trying to have their children enrolled in a particular school but the resources available to the school in question are creating a hurdle.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">The Minister previously clarified the position regarding the ratio of 9:1.  I presume this will be used as a fall-back position.  The system is making it increasingly difficult for families who must already jump through many hoops to access school places for children with special needs.  It may be the autumn before a child enters the system and the appeals process also takes a long time.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">The Taoiseach indicated this morning that the House debate special educational needs.  I presume the Minister would support such a debate.  This aspect of education must be addressed.  While I welcome the clarification provided by the Minister, is it possible to fast-track the application process for children with special needs?</p>

            <p eId="para_877">I will respond first in general terms before addressing specific cases if the Deputy so wishes.  The number of special needs assistants in the system, which has been capped, stands at 10,575.  Through the National Council for Special Education, we are trying to move to a system where each school has an allocation of special needs assistants and each principal will have a degree of discretion in allocating the SNA resource across a range of pupils.  In the past, an individual SNA was attached to an individual pupil for a certain period.  In response to many of the requests that have come back from educational providers themselves and boards of management, we are trying to get a certain degree of flexibility.  It is in the early stages yet and they are looking at ways in which schools in a similar area could possibly share SNAs, from one school to a cluster of schools.  There may be efficiencies and an effective redeployment of resources within that model.  We will be guided by what is practical and what works on the ground, but that is where we are at the moment.  We have to cap it at 10,575 but we want to ensure that we will get the best possible utilisation of that resource.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_878">I am aware of a number of teachers who have come in from a DEIS area and I have already raised the issue of flexibility with the Minister.  We are all seeking a fairer system in this regard but families are facing difficulties regardless because it will take a while to tweak or change the system.  We must help those families around the current system, while sending a positive signal that it will improve for them.  One principal I spoke to said that since 2009 some 21 children with autism have applied for places in his school.  He said he wanted to take them in and it is part of the school's mission statement to do so, but the big difficulty is a lack of resources.  That is just an example of one school.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">People may ask how it is that there are so many children with special needs and whether some people are abusing the system but I do not believe so.  The fact is that these matters are being identified a lot earlier now.  I accept that it comes down to resources but if resources can be taken from other sections within the education system it would give these children and their families a chance.  The last thing we want to see is families having to go to court to seek their legal entitlements.</p>

We are trying to find a system that will work within the limited resources we have and to maximise its efficiency.</p>

         if he is satisfied that the previous Government’s financial investment in the Teaching Council has provided value, in view of the fact that there are still unregistered teachers teaching in schools; his role in ensuring accountability of the council and his role in having the €90 fee reduced, as per the motion passed at recent ASTI conference.

            <p eId="para_882">I see the Teaching Council as key to implementing my Department's strategic objectives.  Much work has already been done by the council to develop education, in particular in maintaining and improving teaching standards.  The Teaching Council Act includes provisions for accountability and the council's relationship with the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">Since 2008, the council has been self-funding, raising its funding mainly from teachers' registration fees.  I agree with the council that the annual registration fee of €90 is reasonable and necessary, as significant functions of the council have yet to be rolled out.  I am committed to this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">Since my Department's tightening of regulations, the numbers of unregistered and unqualified personnel teaching in schools has decreased steadily.  To limit further that number, I intend to commence section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001.</p>

            <p eId="para_885">When the Teaching Council came in first, I had been teaching for about 35 years.  My fellow teachers and I got what I can only describe as a threatening letter, that unless we joined up to the Teaching Council with our €90 our salaries would be stopped.  I did not think that was a very positive start to the work of the council.  I have yet to meet a teacher, although maybe there are some, who says that the €90 fee represents good value, particularly at a time when teachers' pay is subject to cuts and levies.  The previous Government put €5 million or €6 million into the council at that time but will that be recouped by the current Government?</p>
            <p eId="para_886">The council is doing the job the Department of Education and Skills had been doing, so it has been reinventing the wheel.  I cannot see any other word to describe the council except as a quango with another gravy-train of expenses for people attending council meetings.</p>

            <p eId="para_887">I recognise the Deputy's professional experience and background in this area.  Subject to confirmation, my understanding is that the Teaching Council was a professional body requested by participants in the teaching profession themselves, and that it would function similarly to other such professional bodies.  It would also be self-regulating in that a registration fee would be required, and would impose its own rules and regulations.  I am aware that, because section 30 of the Act has not been brought into full effect, the mandatory requirement on its operations has not yet been rolled out.  That has been brought to my attention and it is what I intend to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">I am not aware of moneys that the Department may have given to the council in the past, but I will make inquiries in that regard.  If there is the possibility of a refund then the State will look at that.</p>

            <p eId="para_895">I am aware of the concern expressed by many parents and organisations, including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, in relation to the high cost of school books and the frequent rate of revisions made by book publishers.  I intend  to meet with book publishers and representatives of parents in the near future to discuss this important issue in greater detail.  I will see what role my Department can play in ensuring that revisions of books are kept to a minimum.  Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on textbooks are taken at school level so it may be necessary to encourage individual schools to take a more cost-conscious approach to the selection of books in their classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">I sympathise with parents who are experiencing difficulty in paying for school books.  The harsh economic reality in Ireland means money is tight for many parents.  It is for that reason that I will continue to encourage schools to establish book rental schemes as the most effective means of lowering the cost of books for all students.  Many schools are already using the funding for books provided by my Department to operate successful rental schemes.</p>

            <p eId="para_897">I thank the Minister for his reply and I am glad that he will make arrangements to meet with school-book publishers.  I have raised this question previously and the Minister said he would keep that request under consideration.  I have received correspondence, as I presume other Members have, from a printing company in this country that lost a contract with a major school-book publisher.  In that correspondence, which I presume the Minister has also received, the printing company said there was a huge mark-up for the school-book publishers.  If the figures quoted in the letter are accurate — I have no particular expertise to know whether they are or not — it is a grim tale of how additional costs are imposed on purchasers of such books and the unwarranted profiteering involved.  I hope the Minister will raise that issue with the school-book publishers when he meets them.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">The Minister rightly pointed out that school principals also have a role to play in this regard.  I urge principals and teachers to limit the need to purchase new editions as much as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">I am familiar with the issue to which the Deputy has referred.  Many of my party members and members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party have expressed concerns to me about the cost of books and the apparent marginal changes which nevertheless require a new book to be purchased.  If parents have two or three children in post-primary school, the cost of such books taken together is substantial, particularly in times when many families are suffering from unemployment or significantly reduced incomes.  We must examine that again.  Traditionally, the Department of Education and Science has said it does not have a role to play in that regard.  I intend to change that.  I will meet with the publishers and I will examine all the issues to which the Deputy referred.  If any Member of the House has concerns in this area, I would be happy to hear from him or her.</p>

Once a Minister and a Department puts an issue on the agenda, even though they do not have the power to directly intervene, it brings a new importance to the particular task at hand.  I am sure no right thinking company would ignore the views of a Minister or a Department on an issue that has been ongoing for far too many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">On a matter that relates to an earlier question, that of e-learning projects and publications, is the Department actively involved in encouraging schools to use this facility more or is provision being made to ensure that e-learning projects and publications are more prevalent in the classroom than they have been in the past?</p>

            <p eId="para_902">I am somewhat new to this Department, as the Deputy will be aware.  My impression, which I will confirm or modify if necessary, is that the initiatives on e-learning are coming from local schools.  I already quoted Meath VEC as one example and such initiatives have been seen in other places as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">We are examining the reform of the secondary level curriculum, both at junior and senior cycles, and the question of e-learning must be an integral part of that review.  The former council of the NCCA is meeting fairly soon, in the middle of this month, to review a proposal for reform of the junior cycle.  There will be a major conference, the first of its kind, between the Higher Education Authority and the NCCA to examine the reform of the secondary level curriculum with a view to making it a much better link between primary level, which has a good curriculum and is progressive and open-ended, and third level.  In that context at the beginning of the 21st century we cannot ignore e-learning and all the manifestations that go with that.</p>

I did not get the opportunity to mention to him previously the use of technology by County Cavan VEC.  There are projects within some of its second level schools where subjects such as mathematics are taught through the e-learning process.  If the Department could bring together the knowledge, skill and expertise that have been acquired by schools and vocational education committees throughout the country, it could set a good prototype for developing a scheme on a national basis.</p>

My Department considered the option of constructing a new school but it has not been possible to identify a suitable site.  Accordingly, my Department is now exploring the possibility of developing the school in a cost-effective manner on the current site.</p>

It caused the parents to reflect that their children are being educated there since 1994.  Numerous officials from the Department of Education and Science have viewed the site.  The parents essentially want to know how long it will take for this process to go through and they want there to be transparency in terms of the list of building projects.  Even though their project has been on the school buildings list and has been given the go-ahead, they have not been able to find out exactly where their project is ranked on that list or when the project will proceed.

As the Deputy will be aware, the problem is that the site is constricted and the school is effectively occupying the site.  There is a difficulty in terms of how to build on the school site and at the same time run the school.  There was talk in the past, of which the Deputy is probably aware, of an alternative site being located further down the South Circular Road but, to the best of my knowledge, it is no longer available.  The Deputy can take it from my point of view that the demand for the school clearly exists.  There is excess demand because there is a demand for even another school, with which the Deputy will be familiar.  We are examining ways in which we can overcome the problem.  It is a unique building problem and if we can find an alternative site, we will.  I would love to be able to give the Deputy, as I said to the principal of the school and to others, a much clearer and definite response in terms of time, but I am simply not in a position to do so and I do not want to mislead the Deputy.</p>

          the reason, with redundancies in the primary sector and the prohibition on permanent appointments in the primary sector, he has not facilitated a teachers’ panel for Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna Lán-Ghaeilge while facilitating panels for other patronages; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_918">Over half of the gaelscoileanna are under Catholic patronage and redeployment from these schools is through the relevant diocesan panels.  An Foras Pátrúnachta is seeking a separate panel for gaelscoileanna under its patronage.  A key issue for my Department is how best to facilitate this request in a manner that avoids the inherent inefficiencies of a separate panel for a relatively small number of schools out of the 3,200.</p>
            <p eId="para_919">Given our budgetary situation we need to have sufficient flexibility in the redeployment arrangements to ensure that surplus permanent teachers in all schools regardless of patronage type can be redeployed to vacancies wherever they exist.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">A separate panel for An Foras Pátrúnachta will be considered in the context of ongoing discussions with the relevant education partners in regard to the additional arrangements that are now necessary to achieve the redeployment of all surplus permanent teachers, including those in gaelscoileanna under the patronage of An Foras Pátrúnachta.</p>

            <p eId="para_921">The Government's 20-year strategy for the Irish language cited research showing that Irish was taught to a very good standard in only half of primary schools, in one third of the classes Irish was taught through the medium of English and pupils in just over half of lessons inspected were able to express themselves satisfactorily in Irish.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">The key concern for many in the gaelscoileanna sector is that there will be a reduction in standards and quality in terms of many of these teachers coming forward.  Should An Foras Pátrúnachta na Scoileanna LánGhaeilge not have the right to insist teachers on it panel have a required level of Irish that will allow them to teach in a gaelscoil?  The reality is that the Irish of many teachers is at best rusty and not of a high enough standard to teach children solely through the medium of Ireland.  That is the key concern.  Those in the sector are worried that the quality of Irish teaching and service provided for the pupils concerned will be reduced by many of the teachers coming through the system.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_923">There are two issues involved, the first is the current employment control framework which is part and parcel of the IMF troika deal under which we cannot hire new teachers or make permanent contracts for existing teachers temporarily employed until such time as all supernumerary teachers on panels are redeployed into classrooms where they are required.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">Therefore, our hands are tied.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">I will put the second question back to the Deputy.  It is a requirement for students leaving our second level system — they started their leaving certificate examinations today — that, if they wish to apply to one of the five teaching colleges across the country, they need honours Irish.  Otherwise, they will not be accepted.  An Foras Pátrúnachta and the other groups within the gaelscoileanna movement will need to address the issue.  Is the Deputy saying that a young person entering the training system with an honours Irish qualification in his or her leaving certificate does not have the standard of Irish required to teach in a gaelscoil upon coming out of the college three years later?</p>

          <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_404">
            <from>Deputy Seán Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_926">What I am saying is that some people will be rusty and not everyone will have a competency in the Irish language.  This is the key concern among gaelscoileanna, which are worried about the quality of Irish among those entering the system.  The gaelscoileanna are unique and many of their teachers are driven where the Irish language is concerned, which is reflected in the quality of teaching.  The concern is that, if new teachers are not up to the required standard and are rusty, it will be reflected within the gaelscoileanna system.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_927">We can explore this matter further.  We need to find a system whereby reserve panels comprising teachers who have become supernumerary can be integrated.  We have 29 or 33 — I am unsure, as I am going by memory — panels of employment within the Roman Catholic Church ethos.  We should have regional panels in Munster, Leinster or Connacht or something else that relates to reasonable travel distances.  This system would be extended to all primary school patrons.  We need to find a way of efficiently and quickly redeploying teachers who are supernumerary in their current locations while addressing the Deputy's issue, that is, whether teachers being redeployed from one ethos to another, including a language ethos, should undertake refresher courses, given that they qualified with honours Irish to get into the teaching colleges in the first instance.</p>

            <p eId="para_929">It depends on the length of time a person has been out.  He or she might not have been using the language.  Anyone who views the situation objectively would agree that the level and quality of Irish held by the teacher entering the school would be affected and the language within the school would be dumbed down, which no one, including a new teacher, wants to see.  Teachers are concerned about getting jobs.  There is an argument to consider the matter in terms of the schools in question.  While people claim they are committed to the roll-out of the Irish language and so on, we can make a difference where matters such as this are concerned.  There is no large cost factor.  If we get our act together, the quality of teaching will bear fruit in terms of the outcomes for children passing through those schools.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_931">Higher education institutions have collectively agreed to operate a bonus points scheme for higher level mathematics for a four-year trial period from 2012 to 2015, inclusive, with a review in 2014.  A bonus of 25 points will be allocated to students who achieve a grade D3 or above in leaving certificate higher level mathematics.  This pilot scheme has been specifically designed with the objective of maximising the numbers of leaving certificate students who study for and sit the higher level maths examinations and should compensate for the perceived additional workload associated with that subject.  In particular, it should incentivise the 20% of students who currently move to ordinary level having studied higher level for most of their senior cycle.  As Deputy Smith knows, some students change their minds on the day of the mathematics examination.  I have also asked higher education institutions to examine the scope for  reform of the CAO points system to overcome some of its negative backwash effects on senior cycle students' learning.</p>

            <p eId="para_932">On this, the first day of the State examinations, every Deputy joins with the Minister in wishing all students undertaking the junior and leaving certificate examinations every success.  Am I correct in believing that the State Examination Commission published figures during the week showing that this year will see the lowest number of students ever to undertake higher level maths?  This is a cause of concern, as it is even lower than the previous low recorded in 2007.  The programme for Government commits to introducing a bonus points system for maths linked with specific maths or science courses to encourage participation in courses where skills shortages exist.  Has the Minister made progress in this regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_933">To answer the Deputy's first question and to the best of my knowledge, he is correct.  The information published in the media yesterday was accurate and no one has brought any inaccuracy to my attention.  The new 25 points bonus will not kick in until next year's leaving certificate examination.  The Deputy's predecessor in the Cabinet's education portfolio was aware of the issue, since she was the one who suggested an increase in the points system to incentivise maths.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">Young people act fairly rationally in these regards.  The level of effort required for higher maths, commensurate with the points currently awarded, is higher than it should be and could be utilised to get extra points in other subjects across the spectrum.  We are trying to reverse this situation.  To answer the Deputy's second question, I have not been in a position to explore the matter further, but I intend to do so.</p>

The level of resources provided to the PDST has fallen in recent times in accordance with overall budgetary constraints.

My understanding is that adequate numbers of teachers are available to instruct in maths, science and Irish, the three subjects covered by the trainers, whereas the other subjects are experiencing a shortage.  This relates to our discussion of a few minutes ago.  Many people are working in the sector and Irish language activists feel strongly about the language, but we do not have personnel to train teachers adequately.  They are asking where is the equality in the system.  It is a question of resources and the issue was probably one under previous Ministers as well, but many of those involved in the gaelscoileanna feel strongly about the matter.  If——</p>

            <p eId="para_943">I am aware that having to pay this €200 per annum charge presents a challenge for some learners wishing to participate in post leaving certificate courses.  However, I would point out that the charge is modest and will be met by the Exchequer in respect of an estimated 50% of students who can claim an exemption from it.  The following categories of learners are exempt from paying the charge: full medical card holders and their dependant children, those who are eligible under the student grant scheme and those in receipt of the back to education allowance or vocational training opportunities scheme allowances.  These exemptions should ensure that those who are less well off will continue to access post leaving certificate courses.</p>

            <p eId="para_944">The Minister of State said that €200 is a modest amount.  It is only modest relative to the amount of money one has in one's pocket.  Like many teachers in this sector I am concerned that the people who do not have this €200 will not be able to upskill.  While €200 may be a modest amount to some people it is quite a lot to others, bearing in mind cuts in people's salaries and so on.  I am concerned that this charge will discourage rather than encourage people to upskill.  I accept we are in a crisis in terms of resources.  However, this charge does not send out the right signal to the people in this sector and does nothing to assist in encouraging the knowledge economy.  People who participate in these courses also incur costs in terms of transport and so on.  A €200 per annum fee is a big stake for those wishing to upskill.  I believe this is a negative step in regard to educating and upskilling people.  Also, it contradicts what the Government is trying to do in terms of its jobs strategy.</p>

However, it is not possible to exempt any sector, including the education sector, from the painful adjustments that are necessary.  There are in place provisions to allow the State pay this charge on behalf of the most vulnerable.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">I do not believe that a person for whom education is a priority would consider €200 per annum an obstacle to gaining that education or upskilling which could provide him or her an with an opportunity get back into the workforce.  While PLC learners are generally from the lower socioeconomic categories than are those in higher education, students from less well off families are being protected.  That is the ambition of this scheme.  I believe that this contribution should be seen in the context of the more significant levies applying to higher education.</p>

Anyone who has dealt with social welfare issues will be aware of those people who because they are a little above the threshold do not qualify for exemption.  These are the people who will be heavily affected by this charge.  I accept what the Minister of State said in regard to people on lower incomes.  However, it is the people in the grey area who will lose out.  While I accept the Government's hands may be tied on this matter, this charge is a contradiction in terms of what it is trying to do in the educational sector.  Those who will not qualify for exemption have been already hit in so many other ways.  While they will want to upskill and get a job, they will not be able to afford this charge and will not qualify for exemption.  I do not know how the system could be changed to accommodate these people.  The people required to pay this €200 per annum charge are the same people who have been hit in so many other ways.</p>

The recently announced jobs initiative provides for additional places on PLC courses, which I welcome.  Given the high level of unemployment here and the need for people currently out of the labour market to upskill, there will be increasing demand again this autumn for places on PLC courses.  PLC and other further education courses have been extremely important as a conduit in the area of progression to third level education.

As mentioned by Deputies, the jobs initiative provides for an additional 1,000 PLC places this year.  We will shortly make a decision in regard to the allocation of those places.  In making that decision, I am aware that nationally, the number of PLC places are more often than not over-subscribed and that demand far exceeds what we are capable of providing.  In the context of the difficult financial circumstances in which we find ourselves we had to limit the additional PLC places to 1,000.  They will be allocated to areas where demographically it can be shown that unemployment is a major issue and in areas where in the past demand has substantially exceeded provision.  These areas will be prioritised.  The additional places will be allocated in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_959">I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 20 and 30 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">Changes to aspects of the school transport service were announced in the 2011 budget by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the 2010 Value for Money Review of the scheme.  The wider context is that the budget for school transport increased from some €50 million to nearly €180 million between 1997 and this year.  This massive increase, while heavily influenced by factors such as safety and the transport provision for children with special educational needs, is significantly greater than the inflation rate or the rate of increase in the overall education budget during the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">There is a requirement under the four year recovery plan to deliver savings of €17 million on school transport and these measures are a necessary part of achieving it.  Given the circumstances of the country, the stark reality is that there is simply no scope for reversing these measures.  With regard to the three specific aspects of the changes raised by the Deputy, I would like to make the following points.  The Value For Money review identified that in 2008 the unit cost per primary pupil for the provision of school transport was more than €1,000 per annum.  The charge of €50, representing as it does some 5% recoupment of this cost, must be seen in context.  It is also important to stress that eligible pupils holding medical cards will be exempt from paying the charge and that the charge is capped at a maximum of €110 per family with eligible primary pupils only.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">The increase from seven to ten in the number of eligible pupils residing in a distinct locality and who are required to establish or retain a school transport service broadly represents a reversal back to 2002 levels.  Again, it is important to stress that families of eligible pupils for whom there is no school transport service available may apply for a grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">I assume the Deputy's final question relates to the decision to apply the distance eligibility requirement to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those pupils who have previously availed of free transport under the closed-central schools rule.  This means that only primary pupils who reside 3.2 km or more from the nearest school will be eligible for transport.  In a time of such serious economic difficulties, I am sure the Deputy will accept it is not unreasonable to restrict transport eligibility to those living more than two miles from their school.  There is no change in the position whereby ineligible pupils may apply for concessionary transport in accordance with the terms of that scheme.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_428">
            <from>Deputy Seán Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_964">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I missed his point on how much the saving will amount to, so he might repeat that.  There is very little public transport in many rural communities and we need to know how many students this measure will affect.  When the planners were introducing this change, did they know the effect it would have?  Does the Minister agree that these cuts, if implemented, will radically alter the social fabric of many communities in rural Ireland?  Again, it comes back to a point I made in regard to a recent question, namely, for those outside the system it is seen as another stealth tax on families in rural Ireland.  How much will we actually save and what effect will it have in regard to the social fabric, schools and families in these areas?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CiaranCannon" eId="spk_429" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Skills">
            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
            <p eId="para_965">The saving we are required to make, and have no option but to make under the four-year recovery agreement, is €17 million.  In the context of spending €180 million per annum, that is quite a small saving.  Given the actual <i>per capita</i> cost to the State of supplying the service is €1,020 per annum, a €50 charge is not unreasonable, particularly when one takes into consideration that all families who are holders of medical cards are exempt from the charge.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_430">
            <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
            <p eId="para_966">I am primarily concerned about the disproportionate impact these proposals will have on smaller schools in rural areas.  While I accept we have to live within the budget that has been prescribed for the school transport service, I believe that where there is a will, there is a way.  We can minimise the harshest impact of these proposals if we can have a constructive approach to alternative proposals.  I would like the Minister to consider a phased implementation of the numbers required, contingent on the level of enrolment or perhaps on the number of teachers in smaller schools.  It is unfair to ask a two-teacher school with perhaps 30 or 40 pupils to be obliged to have ten pupils on a school transport route when it previously only had to have seven.  We could perhaps have a phased approach or allow those which already have a service for seven pupils to retain it at that level while moving to a level of ten pupils for new services.  We can live within the budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">The closed school rule gave children an entitlement to transport due to the arrangements entered into when the previous school closed.  Where only one pupil had an automatic entitlement to transport, does that closed school rule take precedence over the requirement to have ten pupils?  As I understand it, the closed school rule will only come into force in September 2012.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cannon</from>
            <p eId="para_968">I attended a small, two-teacher rural school for eight years and that school continues to function perfectly well to this day without any school transport.  All of the children attending that school either walk, cycle or are driven to and from school by their parents or grandparents or other family members.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">The value for money report carried out by the previous Government and the changes suggested in it were part of a budgetary decision taken in October 2010.  The value for money report, in assessing the likely impact of these changes on school-going children, carried out, I would argue, a sketchy assessment of the likely implications of these changes.  I have asked Bus Éireann to carry out a full and forensic analysis now of the impact of these changes, and the result of that analysis will be available to me towards the end of this month.  I intend to use that information to assess the likely negative effects.  If it proves that they will be prohibitive and will actually discourage children from attending small rural schools, I undertake to reconsider the review.  However, I must at all times do so in the context of having to make the €17 million saving.  There can be no flexibility whatsoever in that matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_972">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">Future demand for participation growth in higher education needs to be reconciled with limitations on public resources and a need to protect and enhance core quality.  Although the nature of these difficult trade-offs is described in the national strategy for higher education to 2030, the strategy also identifies the need for more detailed analysis.  In this regard, I have asked the Higher Education Authority to undertake further work on the sustainability of the existing funding framework over the course of this year.  This work will inform consideration by Government of policy options in regard to future funding of the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">As the Deputy will be aware, the previous Government introduced a new student contribution charge of €2,000 with effect from the 2011-12 academic year to replace the existing student services charge of €1,500.  This increased charge will come into effect this autumn.</p>

            <p eId="para_975">The Minister previously spoke about capital utilisation in higher education.  Is he referring to a 12-month academic year and a constant use of resources?  As we all know, plant and facilities are very expensive to put in place and maintain.  Is this what he has in mind, given his particular phraseology?</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_978">I was not sure as I did not see him there, but I would certainly have acknowledged him had he been there.  Over 250 people from the academic side in all of the third level sectors were in attendance.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">While the Hunt report is not perfect, it is the only report we have and I will not pause to have a new report written or to get a new roadmap.  Some aspects of the report are very good and others, frankly, are not all that good.  It is up to the academic community and the third level sector in its entirety to see how it can get better value for the resources that are currently available, for example, in terms of the utilisation of capital resources or the combining of the provision of courses.  I said earlier that it had recently been brought to my attention that there are more than 40 courses in education and teacher training being delivered in 21 separate institutions across the country.  This came as a big surprise to many people who ought to know better.  We need to see how we can combine those courses and spread them out over a longer period of time.  There is intense use of the capital infrastructure in the university sector but not to the same degree everywhere, and there is quite a variation in the intensity of use of the capital infrastructure in the institutes of technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">To answer the Deputy's specific question, at the end of the day this will not be dictated from Marlborough Street or from the Higher Education Authority.  We have invited the participants and partners, against the background of a reality which they too must confront, to come forward with innovative ideas because it is those on the ground who have a better knowledge of the way to do business than anybody else.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_437">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_981">The failure of the Government to reverse the €500 increase in the student service charge is already a significant betrayal of the promises the Labour Party made before the election.  I believe "fighting to defend free education tooth and nail" was the expression used.  In that context, I must express great concern as, I suspect, many students do, about recent comments by the Minister, who stated there was no such thing as free education and that he would look seriously at how third level education would be funded.  That, along with the review he mentioned, leads me to believe that people, students in particular, should be very much afraid about plans to abandon yet another promise made before the election to defend free education and the extreme likelihood that fees are to be reintroduced in some shape or form.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">I wish to hear an assurance that this will not happen.  There are more important people than me who wish to hear this, namely students.  In addition, they wish to have an assurance in regard to the already unacceptable €500 increase in the service charge and the reductions in grants.  The pay many students receive for weekend work may now come under attack via the attack, or review, of the joint labour committees, JLCs and the registered employment agreements, REAs.  They need to know they do not face yet another attack in the form of student fees.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">The Minister knows, and if it were six months ago he would be saying what I say, that the introduction of fees would be a major disincentive to enter third level education, particularly for the less well-off in our society.  It would make a mockery of any proposals to develop a knowledge economy to aid economic recovery.  Will the Minister give the House an assurance that no tuition fees will be introduced, in any shape or form?</p>

            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_984">The Deputy must recognise that we do not live in the world in which he would like to live but in one where this republic has lost its economic sovereignty.  We have lost control of our cheque book.  Every fortnight, the Governor of the Central Bank must report to Frankfurt to state that our fortnightly returns in terms of revenue and cost reductions are meeting targets.  Otherwise, the money that pays the Deputy's and my salaries and those of everybody who works in this building will not come out of the ATM.  That is where we are.  Michael Collins, the first Minister for Finance of this State, had more room to manoeuvre than his successor as Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, has today.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">That we have lost our economic sovereignty is a reality I do not like.  I will not go into the history of how it came about.  However, I wish to regain it as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_987">The only way we can do so is by trading and balancing our way out of the deficit of €9 billion.  The Deputy could close down the entire expenditure of the Department of Education and Skills in the morning and we would still have a deficit of €1 billion.  I will engage in debate with him if he will discuss reality on a platform of reality.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">Concerning fees, every public service has a cost.  The real issue is access to that service and whether a cost barrier exists by way of a charge at point of entry.  There is no charge at point of entry for primary or secondary school.  It was the Labour Party in Government in the 1990s which removed existing anomalies and abolished fees for undergraduate courses.  It is not desirable that a new barrier should exist to prevent the socioeconomic groups we are trying to get into the third level sector from participating.  I asked the Higher Education Authority to find ways in which we can look at the funding of the third level sector in order to avoid that possibility.  I have not changed my values or attitudes in regard to access to third level education.</p>

            <p eId="para_989">The Minister referred to multiple provision of similar courses in our third level institutions.

            <p eId="para_990">I am not entirely sure of the answer to that question.  Like the Deputy, I would have thought some form of vetting would be required and I presume such is the case in a number of areas.  However, it was a member of the HEA who was surprised when the multiplicity of courses was brought to his attention.  We must look at this situation because that kind of duplication is not justified now, if ever it was.</p>

          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_443">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_991">There were two aspects to the Minister's response but not much time to examine them.  I merely point out that it is a political decision to effectively hand over the education budget of this country as interest repayments to bondholders.  We do not have to make this decision.  Does the Minister find it interesting that Greek students, among others, are on the streets now and because of their resistance to the austerity programme Europe is reconsidering restructuring the Greek debt and allowing the country more time to pay it?  Would we not be better off taking that sort of action rather than accepting these unacceptable restraints which are strangling our education system and forcing us towards unpalatable measures such as the introduction of fees?</p>
            <p eId="para_992">Given the restraints the Minister is under and given that his fellow Minister stated only minutes ago it was not possible to exempt any sector from pain, there is also a choice to be made in that regard, in terms of funding our services, education included.  Instead of service charges which are inevitably regressive and hit the lowest earners, we might consider putting taxes on the wealthy.  If we taxed the wealthy, which group this Government and the last one exempted from the pain, we could get the money elsewhere to fund our services.  However, that option never seems to be considered.  It is always about how we will squeeze more and more money out of people who cannot afford it.  If any further financial obstacles are put in front of people entering third level education this will be devastating for our prospects for economic recovery.</p>

          <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_444" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
            <from>Deputy Ruairí Quinn</from>
            <p eId="para_993">It is not my intention to put further financial barriers on access to higher education, particularly for those groups that can least afford it and from families which, historically, did not go to third level education.  The strategic objective initiated by the previous Government, which the Labour Party in Opposition shared and will now implement in Government, is to get participation rates to over 70% because that is the way forward for the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">This is a very unequal society.  The Deputy and I share that view.  However, brains and talent are equally distributed across the population and I want to ensure that those brains and talent which previously could not get into third level education because of financial and family backgrounds are liberated and can participate.  I will do everything I possibly can to ensure that happens.</p>

            <p eId="para_1009">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has a long-standing arrangement with the Northern Ireland Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment, CCEA, whereby joint meetings of the two bodies are held periodically.  One of the NCCA's strategic goals is the promotion of links with the CCEA.  No joint initiatives are under way at present.  The two councils previously engaged in joint work on the use of mobile telephones to support the teaching of Irish and on guidelines for schools in supporting exceptionally able students.  My Department funds An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta, COGG, to co-ordinate the provision of teaching resources for Irish-medium schools.  COGG works in partnership with the CCEA to jointly plan the development of resources, where appropriate.  COGG has recently agreed to invite the CCEA to appoint a representative to its board to further develop this partnership.  Three bodies — COGG, the CCEA and An tÁisaonad in St. Mary's University College in Belfast — have developed a database of all resources available for Irish-medium education on the island of Ireland. An early literacy programme is being developed by the three organisations.  The first stage of the programme will be available in September of this year.  COGG and the CCEA share all teaching resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_1010">We will have to do something about all these acronyms.  I am sure the Minister accepts that it makes sense — socially, politically and economically — for the relevant interests on this small island to work together on many of these issues.  He said that "no joint initiatives are under way at present".  I assume he appreciates that such initiatives represent the way forward.  I welcome the fact that he met Conor Murphy to discuss cross-Border co-operation.  Does he not agree that such co-operation makes economic sense in these tough economic times?  We discussed the price of school books earlier this afternoon.  Perhaps that problem can be examined in this context.  People want these efforts to be rolled out across this small island, particularly in Border areas.  Surely a spatial strategy should be used to work out where kids should go to school or to draw up common sense transport routes.  My main question relates to whether the Minister intends to build on the co-operation that existed in the past.  Does he think there is greater potential for much of this to be rolled out?</p>

            <p eId="para_1011">The Deputy will be aware that a new Minister has been appointed to the Northern Ireland Department of Education, which is responsible for primary and secondary education in Northern Ireland.  I had the pleasure of meeting the new Minister, John O'Dowd, in Dublin last Friday.  We had made contact with each other after President Obama's visit.  I was impressed by my meeting with Mr. O'Dowd.  We have a similar attitude to common sense, practical co-operation.  As the SDLP has said on numerous occasions, North-South help and co-operation makes sense.  We should do it together without getting tied up in the fears and aspirations that have surrounded these issues for 60 or 80 years.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_32">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_462">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_1015">I want to make a few brief points in the two minutes I have left.  This Bill does not provide for the additional staffing that is needed so that a proper social welfare service can be made available to the public.  I am sure the Minister is aware that it is taking an average of 20 weeks to process social welfare applications.  It takes 20 weeks for an application for carer's allowance to be approved or refused.  If one appeals a social welfare decision, it takes between six and 12 months to get a decision.  Those issues should be addressed in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">While I welcome the restoration of the old minimum wage rate, I find it odd that the Government is providing for that measure in this Bill.  The minimum wage was originally provided for in a Finance Act.  I suggest this provision has been included as a smokescreen to give some cover to Labour Party Deputies who are being asked to vote for an extension of one's working life before becoming eligible for the old age pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">The internship scheme needs to be closely monitored.  I hope applicants under the scheme will be treated as employees and will be subject to and have the benefit of labour law.  It is important that those who are hired as interns under the scheme should not replace existing workers.  I hope they will not be used to fill vacancies that have arisen from the non-filling of full-time posts under the recruitment moratorium.  This scheme needs to be monitored carefully to prevent abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">As I said earlier, this Bill is significant because it includes some very serious measures.  It will ensure older people have to work longer and harder, and for less money.  I hope Labour Party Members will oppose this measure completely, just as I do.  It is significant that certain matters, for example relating to resources and staffing, are not being dealt with in the legislation. During the recent general election campaign, Labour Party candidates throughout the country promised that social welfare cuts would be reversed.  I refer particularly to the introduction of the universal social charge and the reduction in carer's allowance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_1021">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The previous Government missed a huge opportunity to overhaul the social welfare system in a radical way during this country's boom times.  At a time when the system was being exploited and loopholes were being created, the Government of the day failed to tackle many of the anomalies in the system.  We are now being forced to look at many of these anomalies at a time of recession.  It is important that they are reviewed and overhauled.  I wish the Minister, Deputy Burton, the best of luck as she tries to reform the social welfare system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">One of the anomalies to which I refer is the failure of the system to encourage unemployed people to sign off from their jobseeker's allowance if they are offered a couple of weeks of work.  If one signs off to take up work, it might take one 14 weeks to get the allowance back after one's period of employment has come to an end.  The failure to encourage people to take up an offer of two weeks of legitimate work is fuelling the black economy.  By the time they take up the work and get back in receipt of their payment again they have lost any benefit from taking up that employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">There are also significant problems in applying for various schemes — the one that comes to mind is the supervisory role in the Tús scheme.  I encountered one young man who has been unemployed for the past two years and was lucky enough to get eight weeks' work with An Post.  He was delighted to get the opportunity to do eight weeks' work but because of those weeks, he is deemed ineligible for the Tús scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">There are many other schemes for which a person is deemed to be ineligible where that person breaks his or her time on the live register.  That system needs to be overhauled.  In so far as possible, we should encourage the taking up of a week's work or a couple of weeks' work.  In another case, a young girl who took up ten hours' work experience for which she was paid at the end of last year has only now got a decision back from the Department of Social Protection after reams of paperwork.  She would have been better off had she not been paid in that case.  There is a need for reform of that aspect of the social welfare system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">We also need to get away from the position where people are being forced to sign on the live register in order to become eligible for schemes.  There are people who want the opportunity to get onto a training scheme or an education course but who cannot be given priority to access such schemes or courses unless they are on the live register.  There are people who for one reason or another, many of which are principled, do not want to be on the live register but the way the system is structured they are being forced into that situation or else they will not be able to avail of the various training courses that may arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">Another anomaly concerns the self-employed.  We have all come across situations where self-employed persons acting as employers have been paying PRSI, maybe for 20 or 30 persons all of whom are eligible to claim jobseeker's benefit, but when the employers themselves fall on hard times they are entitled to nothing.  Surely it makes sense, from the point of view of the Exchequer as well as those who are self-employed, to allow them to make voluntary PRSI contributions.  It will bring additional revenue into the Exchequer and provide them with a safety net if they fall on hard times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">There are difficulties and challenges associated with this issue but they have been addressed in a system that has been introduced in the UK.  If they have been able to solve the problem in the UK, surely we can also address that here and at least put a safety net in place for the self-employed who are the ones who will get us out of the economic mess we are in.  It is they who will create the jobs in the future and get this economy going again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">Some of the previous speakers raised the issue of delays in processing applications.  I would ask the Minister to look seriously at the backlog in processing initial applications and appeals.  If someone is deemed ineligible at the end of that process and he or she has been in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance in the meantime, then the taxpayer is the one who is losing out because of that delay.  If the person is granted scheme approval at the end of that process there is no net benefit one way or the other to the taxpayers because they would have had to pay it out in the first instance in any event.  However, where those applicants are deemed ineligible, the taxpayer is paying over money through supplementary welfare allowance or in excess of the rate of supplementary welfare allowance that should be paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">On the question of child benefit I commend the Deputy Burton for being the first Minister to take the initiative of raising this issue in Brussels.  We have had Minister after Minister in this House who stated that it was terrible, and all the hand-wringing that was done about child benefit going out of this country in the case of EU citizens residing here but where their children residing outside of the jurisdiction.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_1031">I ask the Minister to look at introducing a child attendance payment through the Department of Social Protection rather than a social security payment, which, I believe, would get around the difficulty that has arisen in this regard.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineByrne" eId="spk_468">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_1032">I commend the Minister and her staff in the Department for bringing this Bill to the House.  We are living in changing, uncertain and challenging times but what we need now is courage to do the many tasks that should have been done previously.  The Bill is the first step to bring reform to the social welfare system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">I welcome the reversal of the cut in the minimum wage, the 5,000 jobs initiative and the State pension being pushed out to the age of 67, of which I myself will be a beneficiary when the time comes.  It represents a thinking in advance for the benefit of older persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">A thought that struck me about the programme on fraud in the country last night on TV3 is that there was no remorse shown by anybody, they saw nothing wrong with what was happening and there was a mentality that they were well within their rights to do what they had done because others have done so before them.  What a message to give to the country, to the people outside and, above all, to our children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">There are many flaws in the social welfare system and the Minister might address some of these in the future.  One of the biggest issues I face on a daily basis is rent allowance and its abuse.  Last year the Government provided €600 million in rent allowance and I cannot understand this because in our communities there are a considerable number of apartments and houses lying idle.  Perhaps this money should be put into something that will benefit people in the long run, not just a quick fix.  We have all heard the stories of persons renting out rooms even though they themselves are on the rent allowance, which is fraud and needs to be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">Deputy Naughten spoke about small businesses and the fact so many hard-working people who find themselves unemployed were keeping three and four persons in jobs in the local community and now their jobs have gone by the wayside.  As he stated, such employees were able to claim social welfare but many of those with small businesses now find themselves struggling on a daily basis even to put bread on the table.  Many of those are well into their 50s and believe there may not be anything for them.  For many of them who cannot receive social welfare there is no possible chance of them going on a FÁS scheme or even being able to avail of a back to education programme.  That must be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">As a mother I understand how difficult it is to bring up children but it is even more difficult to bring them up on one's own.  I ask the Minister to consider in the future in the social welfare code that we look at the role of fathers in lone parent families.  Some fathers have no contact at all with their children.  They do not want contact.  They are not even interested in making any small financial contribution to bring up the children they have helped to bring into the world.  For instance, in a case in my area a young man has five children, all with different partners, and has never contributed anything to the raising of them.  It is a significant problem for young people to believe that they can just walk away.  Having children is a responsibility and one must take on that responsibility when one has them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">We need to support those who are in need, not to support those who think they are in need.  There are many who believe they are in need, yet when all the pages are turned and everything about them is looked at, they are the ones who are not in need at all.   There are many who for the first time must sign on the dole and seek jobseeker's allowance.  They have never done it previously.  We need to protect these people even at a time when the State is being defrauded by many who are going out to work on the black market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">Many who are over 50 are being means tested if their partner has had an income or been working and many of them now feel they are being left on the scrapheap.  They have no social welfare and no proper cover if they want to take up a FÁS scheme.  They cannot even avail of back to education facilities.  This must be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">I firmly believe the Bill is the first step in the direction we need to take.  We need to be more accountable and transparent and we need to watch how we use and avail of our funds in future.  Many who have never been in the social welfare system are reluctant to continue receiving payments because they believe they are well capable of working.  The Minister must do everything within her power to ensure that in future we have an opportunity to give those people an education, whether through FÁS schemes or job initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">I welcome the Bill and I hope the Minister will continue in her endeavour to reform the social welfare system.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_469">
          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer</from>
          <p eId="para_1042">I welcome the Bill and I commend the Minister on her stewardship of it.  I share the Minister's objective that the social welfare system must be focused on those most in need.  The job of Government, the State and especially the Department of Social Protection is to protect and assist those who require the help of the State.  In keeping with the comments of Deputies Naughten and Catherine Byrne I maintain it is important to reform our social welfare system and to have a focused social welfare system which protects and assists those who most need help.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">It is important to assert in the House the importance of having a value on employment and of having people in work who are not dependent on social welfare.  The job of Government is to prevent people from being dependent on welfare, to move people off welfare into employment, to allow people to have respect, dignity and self worth and to empower people.  In her fine address Deputy Catherine Byrne made reference to people in need of help.  We must empower people and give them hope and opportunity to be employed and to be in employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">Job creation should be a pivotal axis in the Government's future policy direction.  This axis is contained within the Bill, which has several activation measures that anyone who is serious about people and community would deem praiseworthy, including the restoration of the minimum wage, the halving of the lower rate of employers' PRSI contributions and the national internship programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">In her speech, the Minister referred to social welfare as being a contract between citizens and the State.  The Minister is correct; it is a contract.  People enter into a contract and act to honour the responsibility that they take up when they sign up for social welfare.  A society should be judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable members.  The provision of social welfare is one mechanism we use to assist those most in need.  However, the payments we provide come with responsibilities for those who make claims, including the responsibility to comply with the regulations set down and not to make false claims.  We do not need or require TV3 or RTE to inform us that there is a need to tackle social welfare fraud.  The previous Government made an attempt to start the process and it is the duty of this Government to continue it.  It is fair to say society will not look favourably on those who breach their responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">It is important to encourage people to come forward, to be honest and to stand up and be counted.  Deputy Catherine Byrne made reference to the issue of rent allowance.  There must be reform and transparency in the system.  This year more than 1,000 welfare fraud tip-offs are being made every month.  Last year, some 12,000 tip-offs were made, double the figure for 2009.  Therefore, as our resources become tighter people are beginning more and more to self-police fraudulent claims.  There should be greater activity in the elimination of fraud and in activity related to the policing of fraudulent claims.  In 2008, almost €476 million in social welfare payments was saved through fraud control measures, an increase of €29 million.  The target we set was €600 million.  In the context of our significantly reduced resources savings can be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">The measures to combat social welfare crime will assist in the fight against the hidden economy and the black market, which is flourishing.  People are doing very well in the black market.  The measures we will introduce will ensure value for money is delivered to the taxpayer.  Those who abuse welfare payments provided by the State deserve to be held to account.  This must be part of what we do as a Government.  The Minister's proposals will assist in this while at the same time ensuring that those most in need of our assistance will benefit as required.  We will be judged on the delivery of the way in which we look after those in most urgent need and on social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">Yesterday, Deputy Cowen made reference to me in one of his remarks and quoted me.  This is a coalition Government, a Government of two parties committed to serving and to working for the people to bring about real, meaningful change, which will deliver in terms of unemployment benefit, jobs and political reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">There can be no red line or blue line issues.  Our interest is the national interest.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, has led the way in regard to social welfare.  Those of us who are privileged to be elected to this House must bring about reform of the system and of the Government of our country.  The Fianna Fáil — Green Party and Fianna Fáil — Progressive Democrats Governments funked that; they did not have the bottle to do it.  They made a complete mishap of everything they have done.  When I hear lectures from Members opposite about what is in this Bill and in the jobs initiative I laugh.  I reflect on what happened during the past decade and I see the missed opportunities and the people who are now impoverished as a consequence of the failed policies that those Governments pursued.  That is the reality.  Before they come into this House and lecture us, they should stand up and scrutinise their record on how they dealt with people and the money they wasted during the past decade.</p>

That is what the people want; they want political accountability, reform of social welfare and a Minister who will come to the House and deliver on the programme for Government and the promises made in it.  That will happen with this Bill.  To be fair to her, in her remarks yesterday and as part of her policy platform the Minister has been strong, assertive and courageous in what she has done.  We are not simply about garnering votes.  This is about delivering to the people who have put us in here and it is about the implementation of plans and activation measures which will get our people back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">It is also important to consider the issue of personal public service cards and the way in which the Bill will allow for the cancellation of such cards.  We must examine the composition or role of investigators of social welfare fraud and the extension of powers of social welfare inspectors is important as well.  The sharing and fraudulent use of PPS numbers is a loophole in the system which, I understand, is proposed to be tackled in the Bill.  This is long overdue.  We must examine the fraud of PPS numbers and determine how we can eliminate the scourge.  I commend the Minister on the work she has done and for the Bill she has brought before the House.  It is important that the Bill is supported and that our people are given hope.  There must be an elimination of dependency on welfare and the creation of jobs and employment opportunities.  This is what our people want us to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_1056">With the permission of the House I wish to share time with Deputy Kelleher.  In addressing the Bill I refer to some of the comments made by the previous speaker, for whom I have good regard and respect for his general discourse and banter in the House.  However, I remind Deputy Buttimer if he is concerned about the record of the last Government with regard to employment that during a ten year period there were an extra 800,000 people at work.  I do not suggest for one moment that this is entirely the responsibility or to the credit of the previous Government.  However, the policies that were followed for many years were largely supportive of enterprise and have led to a transformation of this economy.  There are problems and we are going through a crisis, some of which is of our own making and some of which, as the Deputy is well aware, is the result of international pressures and measures.  To suggest that the previous Government is responsible for all ills and that it somehow took an entirely reckless approach in the management of the economy is far wide of the mark.  We will have an opportunity to debate the matter in greater detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">Deputy Buttimer remarked on the record of the current Government and the speed and haste with which it has sought to address many of the problems and issues which exist.  The issues of electoral reform and the banning of corporate donations were discussed a good deal in the run-in to the election but the Government has been hesitant, despite the fact that we prepared two tranches of legislation.  One tranche related to an amendment to the Constitution and a Bill to allow that to take place.  The other tranche of legislation would have served to act in an interim capacity.  Deputy Buttimer's party in particular has sought to avoid that.  I can only draw the conclusion that the Deputy believes there is some stock and a capacity within his party to continue to draw corporate donations during the interregnum until such time as the Deputy's party introduces legislation.  That speaks volumes for the Deputy's views on electoral reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">The Deputy then spoke about promises that were made.  I remind him that his party and his partners in government made many promises in the run-in to the election, particularly on how they would renegotiate the programme that was agreed by the previous Government with the EU and IMF.  The new Government has fallen well short in that regard, failing to renegotiate any aspect of it.  Members opposite seek to take credit for changes to the national minimum wage, which I will return to presently.  The situation in regard to the interest rate on the bailout speaks for itself.  Moreover, in recent days we have seen a debacle emerging through the difference of opinion between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">The Minister, Deputy Burton, suggested during the election that she would support low-paid workers by reversing the reduction in the minimum wage.  She has followed through on that undertaking in this legislation.  However, nowhere along the way was there any suggestion from the parties in government that they would target a much greater number of low-paid workers through an attack on the joint labour committee, JLC, process, which will reduce the take-home pay of up to 200,000 workers.  At the time the previous Government reviewed the minimum wage, representatives of various sectors put forward a coherent argument that a reduction in the rate would open up opportunities for new employees and would not affect existing workers.  One particular enterprise within the private sector sought to test that but failed in the courts.  The process that was put in place by the previous Government protected existing workers and gave an opportunity to employers to live up to their commitments.  In other words, the reduction in the minimum wage was justified at the time in order to provide an opportunity for employers to take on additional staff.  Unfortunately, they did not live up to their commitments in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">The reality is that changes to the JLC system impact on a much broader group of people than would a reduction in the minimum wage.  Minimum wage employment is usually transient and short-term, often taken up on a casual basis by students and other young people before they embark on their career proper.  By contrast, the dismantling of the JLCs or a reduction in the rates payable under the system would have a much greater impact, particularly in the hospitality sector where large numbers of employees are regulated through JLCs and employment regulation orders, EROs.  For many of these workers their job is their career and they intend to remain in the sector in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">Ireland has always prided itself on the quality of its employees in the tourism sector and on the friendly and competent way in which they do their jobs.  Eroding the pay scales in that sector will impact significantly on the quality of the service offered.  Ironically, we have already seen something of that decline even with the higher pay rates that were available during the boom years.  Employers in the hospitality sector have told me they had to pay more than was required under the ERO in order to secure good staff.  Even at that, many of the jobs in the sector were filled by eastern Europeans, which is not to suggest in any way that the work done by the latter was anything less than perfect.  However, visitors to this country come in the expectation of meeting a friendly Irish face and enjoying an Irish-delivered and Irish-provided service.  There are potential losses to the country if we do not ensure that is what they get.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">An important element of our tourism offering has traditionally been its delivery by staff who are up for the interaction with guests and prepared to involve themselves in banter and who are, in turn, well looked after and achieve a sense of satisfaction from their work.  Unfortunately, if we engage in a race to the bottom in terms of wages we may damage the product we are offering.  I acknowledge that the Minister is committed, as she was as Opposition spokesperson, to representing lower-paid workers.  As such, I hope she can in some way alleviate the worst ravages of the measures identified by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  I see other friendly faces in the House who I have no doubt will work assiduously to ensure these proposals are modified.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">The Minister will recall the Duffy Walsh report which was initiated by the previous Government on the basis of its concern that any dismantling of wage structures under the JLCs might have a detrimental impact on various sectors, particularly the tourism sector.  That approach was taken in the face of calls by some of the employer groups for the system to be dismantled immediately.  We have been proved right in our caution.  Most of the recommendations in the report are appropriate and commensurate with what needs to be done, but the most important finding is that there is no appreciable evidence that there is job creation potential in dismantling the JLC structure.  It is important that the Government acts on reports such as this rather than apparently drawing up calculations on the back of an envelope.  When we on this side of the House were in government we were accused on occasion of not following the advice of certain reports.  Of course, we were also accused when we did follow the advice of certain reports.  That is one of the joys of being in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">During the election campaign much was made of the desire of the Labour Party in particular to protect workers on the lowest pay.  The Tánaiste, when he was on this side of the House, came in here on a daily basis and, with great indignation, castigated and chastised the Government — as did the Minister, Deputy Burton — for what was presented as a desire by the then Government to force lower-paid workers to take the greatest brunt of the cuts.  I hope the Minister will recall her views at that time and user her negotiating skills to ensure the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, does not get his way on this particular issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">I have talked about job satisfaction and the capacity to retain people in the hospitality sector.  If it becomes the case that tourism and catering jobs are seen as merely transient, with people doing them for a while before moving on, it will not be good for the industry or for society at large.  There is a need to develop levels of skill and craft within the sector, but we can only do that if there is a proper wage structure where people feel they can develop a career rather than merely taking a job as a filler.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The Bill also gives effect to the Government's internship programme.  I welcome the concept set out in the Bill, but I remind the Minister that I have already spoken about it in the House because it is very similar to the provision set out by the previous Government in the 2011 budget.  The latter was referred to as a skills development and internship programme and it too set out to provide 5,000 places for interns.  However, the most significant difference in the Government's proposal is that it is not quite as beneficial to the participants, with only €50 per week——</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
          <p eId="para_1074">In respect of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2011, I was led to believe that the legislative changes required to bring about the proposed jobs initiative were included in this Bill.  Unfortunately, the jobs initiative is quite limited in its scope and while I do not wish to be overly negative, it is important to highlight the point that the jobs initiative as announced by the Government recently started out before the general election with an initial figure of 100,000 jobs.  It included NewERA and other components in a proposal that 100,000 jobs could be created within a short space of time.  This commitment was given before the general election and many Members who have been around this House for a long time will have learned that politicians' promises before general elections quickly recede in their aftermath.  That is fine and is done and dusted.  The Taoiseach has stated that the recent general election was the ultimate ambush but the only people who were ambushed by the Opposition manifestos were the people of Ireland.  Nevertheless, the people have spoken and one must live with the consequences of that decision.  However, the jobs initiative undoubtedly was paltry in its efforts to address what is a huge challenge facing this country, namely, the issue of unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">All Members of all hues and colours and none accept this to be the biggest challenge facing the current Government.  Equally, however, it is important to be honest with the people and if one analyses the provision of funding made available in the jobs initiative, one finds quickly that it simply comprises the transferring of moneys around the various departmental subheads.  It involves measures such as cutting back on capital expenditure, and Members have yet to learn exactly what programmes will not go ahead, to fund the jobs initiative.  It will be of critical importance for any serious analysis of the potential impact of the jobs initiative to ascertain what moneys, which originally were intended to be drawn down this year, have been transferred from such programmes to expenditure on the jobs initiative itself.  Members still await a response from the responsible Minister, although they are not quite sure whether the relevant Minister is Deputy Noonan or Deputy Howlin.  In any event, they wait in anticipation to find out which Minister is responsible for this particular area in the context of public expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">As for the broad thrust of the Bill, obviously Fianna Fáil welcomes aspects of it.  Demographic challenges exist at present in respect of the changing age profile as the nation ages and this is a subject about which Members could debate at length.  Serious challenges to ensure adequate funding is made for pension provisions in the years ahead are coming down the tracks.  In this context, I recall being told some years ago, by Labour Party Members in particular, that the National Pensions Reserve Fund, in which it was proposed to set aside 1% of GNP per annum for a number of years, was a waste of time.  Instead it was suggested there should be investment in capital projects, which would have further inflated the economy and would have driven matters even further out of kilter.  While it was bad enough as matters stood, to put further fuel on a fire that already was alight would have undermined the economy even further.  When the economy ran into trouble and huge problems arose in respect of the bank recapitalisation and the budget deficit, at least a provision was in place that could be accessed to help the economy to get through the current challenging times.  However, had the then Government adopted the policies that were being advocated at the time of the fund's inception, the National Pensions Reserve Fund would not have existed in the first place.  Moreover, I note that the Government has been quite happy to raid it recently to fund other aspects of its pledges and promises.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">While I do not wish to engage in too much rewriting of history today, it is important to highlight that the Government is one of UFOs, that is, U-turns, fudges and obfuscation in almost everything it has pronounced recently.  For all these reasons, it is important that Fianna Fáil holds it to account and highlights the promises and announcements it made before the general election.  For example, I consider the minimum wage to be one of the greatest stunts of all time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1081">——have a negative impact on lower-paid people and those who were governed by the minimum wage.  Equally, we also were led to believe at the time that it would only apply to new entrants.  This point has been conveniently forgotten by the other side of the House while explaining away the proposed JLC reform put forward by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton.  All Members accept the JLCs should be reformed and the Duffy Walsh report clearly states there should be a number of reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">Fianna Fáil seeks a full and open debate in this House in which all Members will have an opportunity to express their views or to highlight concerns they may have regarding the proposals set out by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, which will come before the Cabinet soon.  For all these reasons, I genuinely believe that if the Government is to be honest, accountable and transparent in the context of the promises that were made before the general election about ensuring that this Chamber would be the place in which policies would be announced, debated and pronounced, then the Duffy Walsh report certainly should be placed on the floor of the House in order that Members can have a proper and open discussion in which everyone may express his or her view.  This may help the Minister in the context of the agonising decisions he must make to try to keep some of the Labour Party Members on side and will give them an opportunity to express their views to enable him to water it down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">However, the most significant point in this regard and the issue I find most hard to accept is that the proposals regarding the JLCs and the reduction in pay and premiums for people who work on Sundays also constitute an attack on the lowest-paid people.  Just as the Minister and many others asserted that the reduction in the minimum wage was an attack, this proposal constitutes a fundamental attack on more than 200,000 people who are governed by the JLC payment system.  Each Member must decide on this issue in the future, when these proposals come to the House by sleight of hand to be rammed through by a Government with a massive majority.  This will take place without providing an opportunity for Members to debate the issue before the decision is made to change the JLCs and to reduce the pay of the lowest paid, as already has been asserted by many Members on the Government side of the House when they were over here in the comfort of the Opposition benches.  There should be honest and open debate on all these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">I wish the internship programme well, because it is a worthwhile initiative that I genuinely hope will be taken up and implemented as quickly as possible.  It was announced by the previous Government and I do not mind who announces such initiatives, provided that they are implemented and have an impact.  I encourage the Government to move forward the initiative as quickly as possible to give 5,000 people the opportunity to take up the aforementioned internships.  The current Administration's continuance of a programme announced by its predecessor in the budget last December constitutes a positive aspect.  Much material relevant to this Bill, which will implement the jobs initiative, has been omitted from it and, to date, I can only find the changes pertaining to PRSI, the minimum wage and a few other issues.  It really is a paltry announcement and response to what is a serious issue, particularly given the commitments and promises that were made when the Government parties were in opposition.</p>

I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the great work being done by the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton.  This jobs initiative is good legislation and I welcome the reversal of the reduction of the minimum wage.  I wholeheartedly encourage the Minister to continue her work in respect of fraud.  I also greatly welcome the lowering of the 8.5% rate of employer PRSI.  Deputy Kelleher should acknowledge that to be a highly transparent measure which is making a major difference to people engaged in the tourism industry, especially in the region in which I live.  I wish to acknowledge its importance and warmly welcome Deputy Kelleher's welcome for the internship scheme.  While the welcome was couched as though the measure was simply an initiative of the previous Administration, I wish to ensure the Deputy realises it is an initiative of the current Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">I have discussed the matter of social welfare appeals with the Minister on a previous occasion.  It can take up to 14 months for an appeal to be processed.  I ask the Minister for her help in the case of an elderly gentleman in my constituency who is 90 years of age.  He has appealed his pension and it will take 18 months to come to a hearing.  I acknowledge the good work of the appeals office in Sligo in dealing with the massive back log.  This elderly gentleman has an infirm wife and he was crying when I met him a few days ago.  We must protect the most vulnerable in our society.  Social welfare is in existence to protect the most vulnerable people in society.  I welcome the Bill and, in particular, the proposals for the jobs initiative.  I look forward to these measures making a positive difference for both employers and employees alike.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tony McLoughlin</from>
          <p eId="para_1090">I welcome this Bill and a number of its initiatives.  I wish to highlight a number of the worthwhile decisions by the Government contained in these measures which, in my view, will benefit a number of areas including employment growth, the counteracting of fraud within the system and the streamlining of the system.  As a previous speaker noted, the decision by the Government to halve the lower rate of employers' PRSI from 8.5% to 4.25% will ensure that the environment will be more fertile for employers considering expanding their business.  The actual cost to the employer has been reduced and this is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">I welcome in particular the provision related to the use of public service cards by providing for the cancellation and surrender of these cards where evidence becomes available that they are being used illegally.  It will be an offence to fail to return a public service card without a reasonable excuse when requested to do so.  This will enable civil servants to develop a resource in the bid to fight fraud in the system.  Information can be scanned or swiped and this will prove beneficial in cases of double claiming or where claimants have crossed the Border to claim benefits.  The proposal originally introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, was a welcome initiative and this Bill ensures that it can be developed further.  I wish to acknowledge the work of the previous Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">I commend the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, for the provisions to facilitate the transfer of the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme from the HSE to the Department of Social Protection.  This will stop duplication where two separate organisations of State are gathering information.  In our efforts to combine resources, this ongoing move by the Government to bring community welfare officers under the umbrella of the Department of Social Protection will result in significant progress in streamlining the public service.  Slowly but surely, we are heading for a one-stop shop in which unfortunate people who have to claim benefits will not have to make their case to several organs of the State.  This is a recurring complaint, that people are forced to go from one place to another and must be interviewed many times.  Shared information is a better use of resources.  In many cases, people are means tested by the local social protection office only to answer the same questions from the community welfare officer.  I am pleased with the proposal in the Bill to extend the Minister's existing powers to make regulations specifying information to be provided by claimants for social welfare benefits that would be useful in determining entitlements to that benefit or in assessing the training or other educational or development needs.  This extension will allow such information to be provided also by existing recipients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">The current level of unemployment at 441,000 is extremely worrying and is especially of concern when one considers the ongoing progress of our exports in the pharmaceutical, computer software and the food and drinks industries.  Further measures to facilitate training in growth sectors such as the pharmaceutical sector should be provided by State agencies as any existing training in this sector is only available in-house in the various companies.  Training and retraining of the unemployed must go hand in hand with the social payments system whereby claimants must be assessed on their educational and training needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">The proposal for a national internship scheme is most welcome.  This scheme will provide 5,000 work experience opportunities for jobseekers in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors.  During this time, participants will receive an allowance consisting of a top-up payment of €50 per week on their existing social welfare entitlements.  The period following the building boom has left this country with people who have to be reskilled and this is particularly the case for the age group of under 40 years because, otherwise, the prospects of long-term unemployment for such people is imminent.  This proposal will be a start in the quest for tackling the plague of long-term unemployment because the system ignores those people, offering nothing only the weekly payment and no prospects of retraining.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">The measures contained in this Bill are vital at this time as we start on the road to tackling the scourge of long-term unemployment.  They support the continued streamlining of government and the necessary changes to State pensions in line with the national pensions framework.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Barry</from>
          <p eId="para_1096">This Bill restores the minimum wage to €8.65 an hour.  In my view, as an employer, this should not be regarded as a level that can be worked down towards but rather as a minimum that can be worked up from.  Businesses are based on having people working with them and not against them.  It is important to make going to work an attractive option and this is the aim of the jobs initiative.  The payment of €8.65 per hour is equivalent to €346 a week or approximately €18,000 a year.  This is very small money and it is hardly enough for a family to survive on but families do and in many cases there is little or no money left for mortgage loans which were taken out in the so-called Celtic tiger years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097">I recently had a meeting with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to discuss a possible practical solution to the mortgage problem and I hope that some or all of my suggestions may be of use.  People are leaving this country and they will not be back again, contrary to some views, if the huge debt hanging over their heads is not addressed.  The worry of the debt is sending them out of the country and unless this is dealt with, they will not be back.  Why should they come back?  The pension age is being moved upwards and while we would all aspire to early retirement and living longer, this upward move cannot be avoided.  If good government is in place over the next decade, the situation with regard to pensions might be completely different.  Ten years is a long time; it took ten years for the previous Government to destroy this country so it is hoped that in the next ten years we might reverse that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">In farming, which is a cyclical industry, many people never saw the price downturn that happened in 2009 and very few saw the surge which happened last year.  Thankfully, that is one of the positive aspects that is pushing our exports up in this country.  I would like to remind those speakers from the previous Government that one in ten of the jobs they aspire to have created in the past few years was created in the public sector, hence we have a bloated public sector which has no productive work to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">The national internship scheme is a fabulous idea and will get skilled people back to work, but will also get them back into employment that matches their skills with a particular job that they are good at.  It is knowledge-based in that respect.  People will receive an extra €50 in their social welfare payments which is not a huge amount of money but the scheme will get them into the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">Once a person enters the workforce, if he or she can add to the productivity of a business — I see it myself — one tends to hold on to him or her because he or she has proved his or her worth.  It is a great initiative.  It is simple but most good ideas are simple.  Halving the lower rate of employers' PRSI provides a chance for employers like myself to make sure that we can employ extra people.  Not only does it help employers, but people who are looking for a job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">Social welfare fraud is another issue which needs to be and is being tackled.  I am glad the Minister stated that social welfare is being targeted at those who are most in need.  That should be the case.  We need to get rid of the jet set community who arrive in, sign on and collect payments because the more we tackle fraud, the more money will be available for genuine recipients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">People complain about JLCs.  They are agreements that were written for a different country at a different time.  They are not relevant today and need to be addressed.  There is no point in political point scoring or saying that people are not living up to their expectations.  I welcome the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michelle Mulherin</from>
          <p eId="para_1103">I also welcome the jobs initiative and the Minister's determination in implementing the aspect of it which pertains to her Department, namely, the 5,000 internships and Tús places and 3,000 back to education places.  While we always hope for more it will provide confidence.  We have said we are going to do something and we do it.  It will be welcome news to the Irish people that we say what we mean.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">However, we might go further.  I refer in particular to community employment schemes.  Approximately ten or 12 years ago some 40,000 people were involved in community employment schemes throughout the country.  Now there are 22,500 participants.  The places were reduced during the boom times when we had full employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">The ethos of community employment schemes is different from that of Tús because an element of the community employment scheme involves the participants applying to be involved but, as I understand it, in the Tús scheme local development companies find placements and the social welfare officers decide where people should be placed.  There are community employment schemes in place throughout the country.  I have made inquiries and learned that the current schemes are oversubscribed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">I am involved in a local theatre company in my town and we cannot get people involved because there are no participants, yet we have suitable jobs and placements for people.  From my inquiries I understand 1,000 people could be put into various schemes within four weeks, such is the demand, and over a period of time 20,000 people could be placed.  If the duration of the scheme for any participant were extended to two years after each term 20,000 participants would be rolled over.  People would be involved in meaningful placements in work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">A lot of the work in community employment schemes involves tidy towns and local voluntary community projects.  The work is tangible and meaningful in places throughout the country.  A lot of the emphasis is on training and so on but we know that people who have been trained or retrained now find it difficult to get work.  The solution is not to send our people abroad.  Rather, as many placements as possible should be opened up for those currently in receipt of payments because work needs to be done in communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">Instead of setting up the new schemes and so on, we should work with what we have.  I am from Ballina, County Mayo, and we have 14 projects with 365 participants which is administered by one officer.  FÁS is criticised a lot with good reason because of cronyism, etc., but that is an efficient way of dealing with schemes.  We already have a system and structure.  In a short period of time people could be put into placements where there is work for them to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">Community employment schemes deserve to be examined because there are a lot of benefits for communities and participants and they have a place alongside Tús.  I ask the Minister to consider the issue seriously.</p>

          <p eId="para_1114">I asked Deputy McLellan where Deputy Barry was from and she told me he was from Cork.  I wondered if he was related to the famous Kerryman that we loaned to Cork back in 1919 and 1920 but she said he was not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">Deputy Barry referred to the public service being oversubscribed.  Is he referring to the workers in this institution which over the past number of months has had its staff numbers depleted to such an extent that the so-called oversubscribed workers are being run off their feet and have not been replaced?  It is something which the Government should take into consideration.  The people who work for the State in this building and provide fantastic service are being strung out and are oversubscribed in terms of work but not manpower.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">As others have pointed out during this debate, inserting the minimum wage into the Bill is a cynical ploy to cover the cuts to the old age pension.  What is clearly an attack on people who have worked hard all their lives is disguised or attempted to be softened by including the welcome restoration of the €1 cut to the national minimum wage.  When Fianna Fáil cut the national minimum wage it was an absolute disgrace.  It should be restored and its restoration should be fully supported because the cut took money out of local economies and contributed to the growing problem of unemployment in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">The two matters should have been separated and dealt with in two Bills rather than in this manner.  Alternatively, the restoration of the minimum wage could have been dealt with by way of an amendment to the Finance Bill.  Let there be no doubting the significance of the change to pension entitlements.  In effect, raising the age at which a person qualifies amounts to a 16% cut to a lifetime pension entitlement, apart from the other effects the change will have on people reaching the end of their working lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">The right to a pension is a fundamental worker's right and must be seen as such.  Resistance to any attacks on the basic pension entitlements of ordinary workers should be a priority for the trade union movement.  It is certainly a priority for Sinn Féin.  The right to a pension is a long-standing Irish republican principle.  The 1919 democratic programme promised to provide for the care of the nation's aged and infirm who shall not be regarded as a burden but rather entitled to a nation's gratitude and consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">All those who subscribe to this principle must defend and extend social protection for older people, rather than cutting it back.  In particular, cuts to pension entitlements and the other cutbacks being implemented should not be introduced to pay for the failures, incompetence and corruption of a small, discredited elite.  It is wrong that low income workers, people on the minimum wage and old age pensioners should pay for the developers and bankers who have robbed the country and should be before the courts.  Unlike in Iceland, where those responsible for the economic crisis are before the courts, the individuals responsible here were given a golden handshake paid for by workers and the poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">We all know who is responsible for the current mess.  The two parties opposite spent the past few years in opposition declaiming those responsible.  This was the basis on which they won a majority in the general election.  During the election campaign, Fine Gael and the Labour Party spoke about the manner in which those involved in banking and speculation brought about the crisis that resulted in the EU-IMF bailout and its associated austerity programme.  The arrival of the IMF was partly the responsibility of the previous Government and the current Government's sin is one of complicity rather than agency.  Fianna Fáil and the Green Party facilitated the disastrous manner in which the so-called elite undermined the economy but failure went well beyond that.  While that Government is gone, we are still left with the hangover from the financial collapse and, unfortunately, its successor, the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition, is continuing to implement exactly the same policies as its predecessor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">Despite much talk during the election campaign of renegotiating the terms of the bailout and burning the bondholders, the Government continues to place the burden on ordinary people who were not in any way responsible for the disasters for which they are expected to pay.  The Government is implementing the same austerity measures agreed by the previous Administration and following the template laid down in the EU-IMF memorandum of understanding, albeit one which was slightly modified recently, including the timetable for raising the pension age, as provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">The Government is clearly following the timeframe laid down by the European Union and International Monetary Fund, hence the guillotine to be applied to the Bill.  Can any of the Deputies opposite, specifically those from the Labour Party, honestly state that they would have seriously considered introducing legislation to raise the pension age if they were not obliged to do so by the terms laid out in the memorandum of understanding?  This measure completely contradicts everything the labour movement stands for.  While Labour Party Deputies may wring their hands and claim they do not have any choice in the matter, rather than pretending they would secure a radically improved deal, they should have been more honest during the election campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">In the early days of industrialisation older workers could expect to enter the poorhouse at the end of their working life when their bodies had been broken by years of hard physical labour.  After generations of struggle we progressed to a point where most people recognised the value of the system of income protection which the State financed through the collection of taxation revenues.  Clearly, we can no longer take this system for granted.  By raising the pension qualification age, the Bill cuts pension entitlements by 16% and will force older people to remain at work despite the potential consequences for their health and well-being.  This proposal was originally made by the Fianna Fáil Party when it was in government in 2010.  At that time, the head of the largest trade union, SIPTU, described the proposal as worse than expected and an attack on State pension provision.  I call on the trade union movement to resist the proposed reforms to pension entitlements.  The trade union movement in France correctly brought the country to a standstill last year when the French Government proposed raising the minimum age for a state pension from 60 years to 62 years.  The Bill raises the age at which people are entitled to a State pension to 68 years.  Is anyone in the leadership of the trade union movement prepared to give the leadership required at this juncture to defend low income families and the rights and entitlements for which old age pensioners paid over many decades?</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">As has been noted, it is a cynical move to include in the Bill the welcome restoration of the national minimum wage alongside a proposal to raise the pension age.  I have no doubt that attempts will be made to use the opposition of Sinn Féin and others to the Bill as a means of suggesting we opposed the restoration of the minimum wage.  This tactic will be employed to circulate a message that Sinn Féin is against the minimum wage.  We were the first party out of the blocks on the need to restore the minimum wage.  While that remains our position, we are against linking its restoration with the other measures proposed in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">During the election campaign, Sinn Féin's stance on the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill, which was taken on the basis that we understood exactly what is entailed by the postal services directive, was spun by a certain political party to suggest my party opposed the Bill because it sought to protect postal services.   As was the case in Britain where the Labour Party hoodwinked the postal unions by selling the directive as a guarantee of postal services——</p>

          <p eId="para_1127">——the reality is now dawning on postal workers that the directive is a charter for all the things the Labour Party claimed it was not.  I look forward to revisiting this issue shortly and hope the Labour Party in government will take cognisance of my comments on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">As I indicated, the restoration of the national minimum wage is welcome.  No one who knows my party's record on the issue will be fooled into believing that our opposition to the Bill is because we support lowering the minimum wage.  While the restoration of the minimum wage is welcome and fulfils at least one of the Government parties' election promises, low paid workers continue to be under threat.  The recently published Duffy Walsh report on joint labour committees and wage orders was supposed to form the basis for consultations involving the trade unions.  However, comments by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and others indicate that it is intended to go beyond the report's recommendations.  Low paid workers could still find their hard won rates and conditions undermined in one way or another.  The Duffy Walsh review arose from the EU-IMF bailout.  It is clear that when the IMF and EU ask for or order a review, whether of employment rights, credit unions, pensions or the sale of State assets, they have in mind a specific outcome which will not benefit the majority of citizens.  As with the Duffy Walsh report, the findings of a review can be set aside if they are not as the IMF and EU wish and measures that are more inimical to workers' interests can be pressed ahead with.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">People should not be lulled into believing that the restoration of the minimum wage means that the threat to low paid workers has been lifted.  When the restoration was announced, some employers' spokespersons let it be known that it would be much more valuable to them if the outcome of the review of the JLC rates was favourable to their view.  Given that the JLC rates affect 200,000 people, one can see the reason they adopted such a position on the matter.  Approximately five times as many workers are covered by wage orders as by the minimum wage.  The financial gains to employers if wage orders are undermined and other conditions are altered, for example, those governing overtime, are much greater than those that would accrue to a small number of employers who pay the minimum wage.  If linked to legislation to allow employers to opt out of an inability to pay clause, such measures could result in a race to the bottom in which tens of thousands of workers find their already modest incomes slashed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">I will give an example to the types of workers covered by the current arrangements to cut through some of the propaganda being spread by those who advocate going beyond the recommendations of the Duffy Walsh report.  Under the employment regulation orders set out in July 2008, a hairdresser in Dublin is entitled to a basic rate of €303.59 for a 39 hour week or only €268.07 if under the age of 18 years.  This amounts to €7.07 for a person aged over 18 years, which is less than the national minimum wage.  The rate set in June 2007 for contract cleaners was €370.50 for a 39 hour week, which is marginally above the restored minimum wage.  I could list several other areas, including security, clothing and the hotel sector, where special rates apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">Even with the modest increases that have occurred since then and with overtime of time and a half and a Sunday rate of double time, we are not talking about people living in the lap of luxury.  They are simply trying to exist.  It is hard to imagine that Dublin hairdressers will be sponsoring any Fine Gael gold classic in the K Club any time soon.  These are the type of people who, it has been decreed, are to bear the brunt of paying for the gamblers' debts.  While those responsible have been pensioned off, protected and allowed to escape the consequences of their actions, low-paid workers are being targeted at the behest of the IMF.  Under this Bill they will have the dubious pleasure of working longer for less.</p>

        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_501">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_1132">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  When I was on the campaign trail in the towns and villages of east Cork last November, December and January, like most candidates, I was able to see at first hand the effects of our broken economy.  I had an opportunity to call to those, young and old, in rural homes in Cloyne, Carrigtwohill and Killeagh, as well as in urban settings like Mallow, Midleton, Cobh and Youghal.  I met young men and women struggling to make ends meet and pay their mortgages and household bills.  They could not pay the ESB and could not afford their heating bills.  I met a man who had no food in his fridge and a woman who had a leaking pipe.  She could not afford the luxury of a plumber because it was a case of either hiring one or having enough money to eat.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">Meeting weekly or monthly bills was possible for such people, but only by making sacrifices.  Raising the age of eligibility for the State pension, as set out in this Bill, will undoubtedly create a poverty trap for many older people.  Many of those lucky enough to have work, for example, will be contractually obliged to finish at 65, forcing them to seek alternative employment.  They will most likely be in the dole queue where they will be joined by many jobseekers in the 50-plus category who have already lost their jobs and who will find it notoriously difficult to be re-employed.  So a situation will be created where the proportion of the population receiving the jobseeker's allowance will increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">Critically, the fuel allowance which helps people to meet their fuel costs is currently available to those on the State pension transition, but is not available to those on jobseeker's benefit.  Poverty among older people, especially those living alone and those who do not own their own homes, is disgracefully high.  Individuals and families on the margins between struggling to survive and going under, will be further penalised by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">I cannot but think of those elderly people I called to last November, December and January.  Anyone who votes for this Bill is voting to condemn thousands of older people to an existence in the darkness and cold.  It is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 avoidable deaths occur each year as a result of extreme winters.  The State pension and associated benefits are the most effective tools in reducing poverty among this group.  If older people are forced to go on jobseekers' payments instead of a pension, they will be hit by a cut of €40 per week.  Once again it is older people on the margins who will be disproportionately affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">On its election, the Fine Gael-Labour Government promised a new dispensation in politics: out with the old and in with the new.  That, however, is not what we are being presented with.  Rather, this Bill is laden with the political cynicism of two parties who have learned how to play the game based on the rules of the past decade and more.</p>

          <p eId="para_1148">I thank the Minister and commend her, and her Department, on the work and thought they have put into this Bill.  This legislation, along with the Finance (No. 2) Bill, will introduce measures to promote the Government's jobs initiative, as well as changes needed in the social welfare code and in the Pensions Act.  I view this Bill as a reaction to restore equity for the lower paid by the re-introduction of the hourly rate of €8.65 as the minimum wage from 1 July.  This is something we hold close to our hearts as a protection for those who are most vulnerable in society.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael considered this had to be done as a matter of the utmost importance, so we are dealing with it within our first 100 days in office.  I commend the Minister on that and I am delighted to be part of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">This reinstatement of the minimum wage is a reaction to a harsh and unfair decision by the previous Fianna Fáil Government to drastically cut €40 every week directly from the pockets of our lowest-paid workers.  The sum of €40 may not seem like a lot of money but it amounts to 11% of their take-home pay.  The previous reduction left workers on the minimum wage with €306 per week, thereby questioning whether it was worth their while to work.  We must reward those who work.  The Government's decision to restore the minimum wage shows that it is committed to the lowest-paid workers and those who are most vulnerable in society.  We must do this at all times during the Government's tenure in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">We need to stimulate the economy but the reduction of the minimum wage was doing the opposite.  People on the minimum wage spend every penny they earn in order to survive and sustain any standard of living.  To reduce that wage further puts working people into poverty.  If people are asked to live off €306 per week they will ask what society is trying to achieve and will question its sense of decency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">This timely reversal will vindicate the Labour Party's position that the lowest-paid workers should be protected first and that work should be rewarded.  Work has to be rewarded but the cut in the minimum wage was not an incentive in that regard.  The reversal of an ill-conceived attack on the lowest earners in our society will make a real difference to those who join the workforce and decide to do so on those grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">The Bill will also establish a national internship scheme, which I am happy to see.  Throughout Europe, Canada and Australia, one sees people seeking to join such internship programmes with a view to getting real work.  The proposed scheme will assist those who have been on jobseeker's allowance for more than three months to gain valuable experience and combat long-term unemployment.  People want to work because the prospect of long-term unemployment is both demoralising and unfair.  The internship scheme is a step in helping people to re-enter the workplace and is a positive development.  People throughout the country will regard this scheme as a way of staying in Ireland and developing experience, as well as having pride in themselves.  They will thus participate in developing businesses and voluntary organisations in the public and private sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Overall, the scheme will put skilled, educated people to work.  We have such people in abundance but an additional sense of energy will emanate from the new scheme which, to begin with, will provide 5,000 opportunities for jobseekers.  We can even take the scheme further and, to this end, I am currently working on related issues with some of the relevant Departments.  It is important to keep the unemployed close to the work environment and this scheme should be viewed as an opportunity to train and get hands-on experience that may be crucial to their success in finding work in the near future.  If this internship scheme gives any young people such opportunities, it is to be commended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">While considering the lowest paid in society, the Government must also aid employers.  The halving of employers' PRSI rates, as set out in the Bill, is a welcome development because small businesses around the country are finding it hard to survive, given the crippling rents and rates that arose from what was a false economy.  They are getting a break in a direction which will entice them to employ people again, particularly in labour intensive industries which will help tourism, agri-business and micro-enterprise, three areas in which we have particular proficiency.  The easing of the costs on employers in this way will help job creation and improve labour cost competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">Many Deputies have made comments that are not cognisant of the fact that IMF is here.  We have lost our financial sovereignty.  There will be very few good days until the IMF is gone from our shores.  We are taking small and gradual steps to improve the country.  To those who can contribute to it, I commend them for doing so.  Everybody has a part to play.  This is a good day and a good step in the right direction.</p>

I would love to hear the evidence to that effect but I do not believe that measure made us one whit more competitive.  It is that type of message that comes across from vested interests that is not challenged and that can result in an entire community whose members are dependent on the minimum wage finding themselves in extreme poverty.  By reversing the cut in the minimum wage, the consequent increase in income of up to €40 per week can make a difference between people not being able to make ends meet and being able to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">It is extremely important that we have put down this marker in our society that we will not have a race to the bottom — that we will not condemn our least well paid to poverty.  That is very important in these recessionary times.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">Every cent that is spent in terms of the increase in the minimum wage will be spent in the community in the local shops because it is there that people on low income spend their money.  They do not have surplus disposable money to spend on a luxury holiday or a car.  They spend their money in the community on bread and butter issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">This Bill is generous to employers in providing for a halving of the lower rate of the employer's PRSI contribution from 8.5% to 4.25% where reckonable earnings in a week do not exceed €356.  That is a significant concession to employers in the catering and tourism sectors.  It will cut costs and should help to incentivise them in terms of their workforce.  That combined with the reduction in VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% means that employers should have no reason to complain and should recognise that the Government is taking their interests carefully into consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">The activation initiatives in terms of the national employment and entitlements service that will be implemented under this legislation are extremely welcome.  I particularly welcome the national internship scheme which provides for 5,000 work experience placements for jobseekers.  The terms of reference extend to private, public, community and voluntary sectors with a top-up of €50 per week.  That is extremely broad.  Employers in every sector will be able to avail of this scheme.  As Oireachtas Members, we  should show good example and lead from the front by taking on interns and giving them work experience for up to nine months.  It would be desirable for us to avail of that initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">Perhaps the most controversial area is the question of the increase in the State pension age.  The EU-IMF bailout deal negotiated by the previous Government requires substantial adjustments to the State pension age by the end of June 2011 so there is not  much time to deal with these adjustments.  State pensions will be standardised at age 66 in 2014, increased to age 67 in 2021 and to age 68 in 2028.  We recognise the reasons this has been done.  It is due to the rapid growth in our ageing population and because there will be a decreasing workforce comparatively, with the ratio of six workers for every one pensioner at present compared with two workers for every person over the age of 65 in 2050.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">Ironically, a former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevey, had the right idea.  He wisely put aside 1% of GNP in 2000 or thereabouts into the National Pensions Reserve Fund to prepare for the rainy day but through the mismanagement of the previous Government virtually all of that money has been transferred to recapitalisation of the banks and the EU-IMF bailout.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">Raising the retirement age is a little like a curate's egg, it is not all bad — there are good aspects to it.  We have a healthier population now and many people would like to work to a greater degree if they had the choice but there are considerations to note.  I believe anomalies will be created in terms of people's income and entitlements.  The Senior Citizens Parliament has expressed concern at the discontinuance of the transitional State pension prior to age 66.  It has also expressed concern that many State agencies such as the VHI, the Drivers Licensing Authority, the Passport Office and CIE, as well as many companies in the private sector such as Aer Lingus, have different rates, benefits and concessions which become applicable at the age of 65.  Equality legislation may be required to address some of these issues to ensure that we do have various anomalies created by the legislation which would disadvantage the elderly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Robert Dowds</from>
          <p eId="para_1165">In speaking in favour of the Bill I want to begin by saying I see it as a small step towards a more inclusive society.  I congratulate the Minister on her imaginative way of using a relatively small amount of money.  The previous Government sought to downgrade the standard of living of our most vulnerable by cutting the minimum wage and I am delighted to see it is being restored to its original rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">Given that we live in recessionary times it is important that Government initiatives are driven by a desire to make Ireland a fairer and more equal society.  There are two reasons for doing that.  First, it is the right way to treat people and, second, as an excellent book entitled <i>The Spirit Level</i>  by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett demonstrates, more equal societies work better for everybody, whether they be rich or poor.  I recommend that every Deputy read that book because it is a comparative work and demonstrates what is happening in various countries around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">Unfortunately, the Government will have to introduce painful cuts in the days ahead and the only way this will be regarded as broadly acceptable will be if the Government is seen to be acting fairly.  This means that on the one hand the better off will have to take the brunt of the cuts while on the other hand, the less well off and excluded will have to be protected as much as possible.  I see this Bill as addressing the second point.  The Labour Party stands for a more equal and more caring society and to that end I very much welcome the reversal of the shameful decision to cut the pay of those on the lowest wages who go to work every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">I want to address the national internship scheme and put some points to the Minister that I would like her to consider before the passage of the Bill proceeds further.   I very much welcome this proposal and hope that it will help to keep some of our best and brightest people from emigrating, and will also help other people throughout society.  However, the scheme must be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that employers are not taking advantage of vulnerable interns.  To that end, I ask the Minister to clarify the provisions that have been made to ensure that employers are not taking on interns, using their labour for the duration of the stay and then not taking them on as full employees at the end of that time but taking on another new intern and repeating that process indefinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">As I understand it, the scheme proposed by the previous Government provided that placements would last for six to nine months, which an employer could fill a maximum of three times.   I suggest that the duration of placements be increased from nine to 12 months so that an employer can only replace an intern once.  This would be better for the intern and ensure that the scheme is not used by employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">Sections 17 and 18 will ensure that social welfare fraudsters will pay the full price for ripping off the country, something that should lead to more resources being made available for those who really need them.  I am surprised that there has not been more focus on this aspect, given the number of complaints I received about the issue during the general election campaign.</p>

        <speech by="#ColmKeaveney" eId="spk_516">
          <from>Deputy Colm Keaveney</from>
          <p eId="para_1171">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I welcome the introduction of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, a crucial first step in calling a halt to the economic crisis inherited by the Government.  I am confident it will mean good news for employers and workers.  I would not claim to be an economist but the Government is trying to simulate the bottoming out of the crisis.  The implementation of the Bill will help to achieve that aim.  Given the resources available to the Minister in this regard, the Bill is a modest step but it is necessary that we start tackling long-term unemployment.  We must consider the human cost of doing nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">Previous contributors who have since absented themselves from the debate engage in what may be described as the "Chicken Licken" politics of "the sky is falling down".  For example, Deputy Martin Ferris referred to our refusal to be tough on bondholders.  We have limited resources because the Deputy worked in cahoots with Fianna Fáil during the last Dáil in terms of the bank guarantee.  It is also the reason our arrangement with the EU and the IMF is a stern one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">The Bill restores the cut in the national minimum wage.  The cut was a cynical move by the previous Government.  Without doubt, we need to try to provide as many incentives as possible for people who want to return to work.  Cutting the wages of the lowest paid in society is not the way.  It is certainly not the way of the Labour Party.  Reforming the social welfare system is a priority for the Government, as clearly set out in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will probably identify with my next comments.  Last Saturday, I met a man in my home town of Tuam who owns a coffee and confectionery shop.  His first paying customer on Saturday was at 12.30 p.m.  His issue did not relate to whether he was paying premium rates on a Sunday because he has never been open on Sundays.  Rather, his issue was that there was not a bob in the pockets of the people walking up and down High Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">The restoration of the minimum rate of pay will have a significant positive outcome for the local economy.  We are trying to undo the damage done by the previous Government, which took money from the pockets of the most vulnerable people in society.  As Deputy Costello stated, these people are not investing in shares or repaying mortgages on second properties.  They only need to survive on a minimum rate of pay.  As such, the restoration of the minimum wage will boost local economies and create jobs.  I am not convinced that deflating the economy and removing money from people's pockets will create jobs.  Indeed, the deflationary tactics inherited from the previous Government have contributed to the significant number of unemployed people.  We need to tackle this issue through a combination of education and training and by instilling confidence among the unemployed in their ability to return to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">Young people and new entrants are also entitled to be confident about entering the labour force.  The back to education programme will provide 3,000 places for adults who have not received their leaving certificates.  The national internship scheme will, once fully established, offer 5,000 work places to young people in all sectors of the economy.  We hope these measures will bring a halt to emigration.  As a rural Deputy, the scourge of emigration is tangible and its impact is visible.  This is lost on some urban Deputies, as one cannot get the same sense of the impact of emigration when walking around an urban setting.  A rural Deputy can see how significant it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_1183">The Opposition, including the Technical Group, is looking for more time to discuss Second Stage.  The reason we will not be given more time is that the Bill must be passed in a hurry to satisfy the deadly duo of the IMF and the EU.  Regardless of the argument that the IMF or the EU is doing good things for us, how can it be a good thing that we are being forced to push something through without people being satisfied there has been enough debate on it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">People have been discussing organising celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising.  The more I hear about it, the more I wonder what it is they will be celebrating in 2016.  It will not be Irish independence, as we are now a puppet state and the length of debates in the House are being decided by the IMF and the EU, our great friends.  If that is the road the Government wants to go down, so be it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">I was not in the Dáil, so I watched the performance of the last Government from the outside.  It did a great many bad things but what annoyed me about it the most was its arrogance and lack of sincerity.  I am disappointed that the new Government seems to be following the same track.  Many Members, perhaps everyone, on this side of the House would want to vote to restore the cut in the minimum wage but its restoration is being lumped in with provisions the Government knows we cannot support.  The spin will be that we are somehow preventing the increase in the minimum wage to the previous level.  It is unfair and those opposite know it is not true, yet the Government is forcing us into this situation.  I will not be able to vote in favour of the restoration because of this approach even though I agree with an increase in the minimum wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">I also agree with the excellent idea of bringing the services provided by community welfare officers, CWOs, into a one-stop shop.  As a county councillor, I needed to deal with CWOs.  I also needed to attend a CWO when I was on the dole.  The idea is a good one because there are no controls over the current system and it is wide open to abuse.  As the Minister of State is probably aware, someone who receives a council house in my area must attend a CWO to have it furnished.  Constituents have told me consistently of how they were given no choice but to go to a particular shop.  This is strange.  Surely someone should be allowed to get the best value for money but this is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">I hope the new system will allow people to take control of the money being spent on them, as it will incentivise them to get better value for money.  Under the old scheme, the incentive was to feather the nest of the shopkeeper who knew the CWO.  That is a simple fact.  I am almost out of speaking time.  While I have much more to say the EU-IMF cannot unfortunately wait for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">The Tús and internship schemes are interesting, in particular, as they are being introduced by a Government that contains some of the apostles of James Connolly within.  As an intern, a person will work full-time and be paid €50 per week.  However, a person who participates on a Tús scheme will be paid only €20 per week.  Why is an intern more valued than a person who participates on a Tús scheme?  Is it the case that an intern is a better class of person?  Everyone should be treated equally.  Also, can employers not be encouraged to pay the €50?  Having an employee at a cost of only €50 per week is quite good value, particularly when resources are scarce.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanCollins" eId="spk_524">
          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_1189">I recently heard the slogan "kissing up and kicking down", which is a US expression.  To my mind, this Bill is licking ass to the EU-IMF, the wealthy and business elite here and in Europe while at the same time putting the boot in on the most vulnerable, namely, people on low wages, welfare and State pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">Like other speakers, I welcome the restoration of the minimum wage, which is badly needed.  However, it is not welcome as a sop or trade-off for putting the boot in on workers on JLCs or EROs.  JLCs were introduced because of a high level of exploitation and lack of rights in specific areas of the economy.  This situation has not changed.  If one is on a low wage, overtime and pension rates are extremely important.  Prior to my election to this House I worked as a postwoman and knew many postmen and postwomen who had to apply for FIS and relied on overtime to feed their families and pay their mortgages.  The logic behind all these measures, the approach of this and the previous Government and the IMF-EU is clear, namely, to drive down wages for working people, drive down welfare rates to incentivise people to go into low-paid dead-end jobs and to introduce workfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">I agree that welfare fraud is a crime and that this matter needs to be addressed.  However, is it not the case that there is widespread abuse of the welfare system by employers who are paying low wages knowing full well that people are also claiming welfare?  Has there been any attempt to identify the scale of this abuse by employers and what penalties are in place in this regard?  What resources will be allocated to identify such employers?  If these employers did not exist, there would be no social welfare fraud.  It seems the only penalties are for those on welfare, the most vulnerable of people who are trying to earn extra money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">I too have concerns in regard to the Tús scheme for the reasons outlined by the previous speaker, Deputy Flanagan.  I do not want potential real jobs to be replaced by work experience and workfare, which is another means of driving down wages.  We learned this from the FÁS training schemes which were abused over a number of years.  I am opposed to that aspect of the legislation.  I feel compelled to vote against this Bill on the basis of those elements of it, while supporting the restoration of the minimum wage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_525">
          <from>Deputy Shane Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_1193">I share many of the views expressed in this House and understand fully that the motivation, thrust and emphasis of Bills like this is always how much we can give and to how many.  It is the nature of political demand that we come here and make representations on behalf of those who are not getting enough social welfare or are being deprived or even victimised by the system.  I share those views.  Like other Members in this House, I would like too see more rather than less social welfare being paid.  I believe that should be the objective of everyone in this House because there are so many in Ireland who are suffering, cannot get jobs or welfare or are disabled and deserving cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">Parallel with that is an extraordinary policy regarding social welfare, which is thoughtless and is symbolised by the disaster that was and is FÁS, an employment agency paid for by the State.  The attitude of successive Governments to FÁS was to give it money to sort out the unemployment problem and to let it get on with it.  I do not know if Members are aware that FÁS was getting €20 million every week at the height of its troubles.  Some €1 billion per annum was going to FÁS in an effort to pretend the Government was doing something about the unemployment problem.  Little thought went into its structures or training.  There was certainly little strategy in regard to the end product.  The result of this was that people in FÁS pretended they were sorting out the unemployment problem by introducing training courses which seemed extraordinarily good and worthy.  However, the problem was that there was no strategy behind them and no jobs at the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">FÁS became corrupt and corrupted because those courses were not being filled, in some cases were not adequate or up to scratch and did not fulfil the mandate for which they were established in terms of producing qualified people.  That was part of the attitude to the unemployment problem here.  However, FÁS did not resolve the problem.  It only trained people for jobs, some of which did not exist.  While some of the courses were good and some of the staff were excellent the structural attitude to unemployment was to give FÁS money and tell it to get on with it.  The evidence is that the problem was not sorted out and FÁS simply feathered its own nest.  That was one of the biggest problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">The other problem — it is the elephant in the room and we should not be frightened about addressing it as the Minister did — is that there is something kind of fishy about the unemployment statistics which keep coming out.  The most recent figures in relation to unemployment are that there are 300,000 people on the live register but 443,000 people claiming benefit.  An OECD official who recently visited Ireland although puzzled by this could not explain it and nor can I.  There are various excuses and plausible reasons there is a gap between these two official figures, but it is an extraordinarily large gap which must indicate there are a large number of people who, one way or the other, are earning money while claiming unemployment benefit.</p>

          <p eId="para_1203">It is clear there is no parallel with these figures in OECD countries.  There is no explanation for this extraordinary gap.  It is clear that unemployment benefit is, not to put too fine a tooth on it, an easy system to access.  It appears that a large number of people who are claiming unemployment benefit are not being encouraged unduly to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">When my wife was involved in a political campaign on my behalf, she was thrown out of RTE for a short period and was told she had to claim unemployment benefit.  The Minister of State will understand this.  My wife was not going to claim unemployment benefit because she believed she would be returning to work in a short time.  While she did not actually need it she was told she had to claim unemployment benefit during the period she was out of work, so she did so.  The amount was quite reasonable.  No questions were asked and she simply signed on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">I cannot remember how long it was as it was a period in which I was in purdah and she was in Coventry.  There was no effort during that period from the people in Bray from whom she drew the dole to find her a job, which was a little odd.  Perhaps they expected her to get back to RTE where she had been employed, although there was no guarantee of that because she committed the cardinal sin of being involved in a political campaign, which was not allowed at that time.  There was no effort to get her a job, which was strange because, given her qualifications — she had a degree and worked in broadcasting and so on — one would have thought the system would have known certain avenues were available to her.  All that happened, however, was that she got an amount in cash every week, whether by cheque or in cash I cannot remember, which was given to her willy-nilly with absolutely no strings, pressures or encouragement attached.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">Parallel to the real hardship which exists in the social welfare system, there is a need for a more stringent examination of those who are in receipt of social welfare.  Questions must be asked as to whether people are exploiting the system.  This cannot be resolved by gestures such as dividing FÁS into two parts and putting one part in the Department of Social Protection and the other in the Department of Education and Skills.  It requires a serious attack from the top and the bottom on the culture of unemployment so that those who really need it are protected and get more but those who do not really need it do not benefit from the system.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_532">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_1207">I agree very much with some of the points made by Deputy Ross with regard to abuses of the system in place, and there is little doubt there has been a culture of abuses in this country for a long time.  However, some interesting research carried out in Britain last year showed for 2009 that social welfare fraud amounted to between £1.5 billion and £2 billion, which is a lot of money, but it also showed that tax evasion in the same year by the richest people in society, including the large corporations, amounted to £80 billion.  While I would of course agree with tackling fraud in the social welfare system, we should also examine the other end of the spectrum, where the State has great potential to reap a good reward.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">With regard to the Bill, many of the measures have been discussed at this stage of the debate.  As I have said previously, as an employer, I know the VAT change was a huge boost to the restaurant and hotel industry — I am not sure everybody realises how much of a boost it is.  The PRSI measure is also a boost, if not by quite as much.  One point about the PRSI change is that the Government needs to consider the amount of PRSI evasion in the restaurant and hotel industry.  I know from taking on people and bringing them in from working in other restaurants that they are often not registered.  There is serious evasion in the industry and while I do not know if work is being done to tackle this, it certainly needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">In principle, the internship scheme is a good idea although I am aware that some will abuse the system.  There is some evidence that Tesco, which made €200 million here last year, has been taking on people under the scheme when too often it amounts to no more than free labour.  While the scheme is a good idea, it needs to be monitored.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">In checking whether such schemes were much used elsewhere, I found some information from the United States which gives an idea of the thinking there on the issue.  The US Department of Labour has outlined a list of criteria that must be met in order for an internship to be unpaid, which is the system to be introduced here.  In the US, the training must be for the benefit of the trainee, the trainees must not displace regular employees, the employer that provides the training must derive no immediate advantage from taking on the individual and unpaid work is only acceptable where the future benefit outweighs the short-term absence of pay.  If the Irish system is to be in the best interests of society, the State and the people, it needs to be very well monitored.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">I will conclude by raising the issue of the age at which a person is entitled to a pension.  I regard the proposed change as a retrograde step.  If this had been mentioned five years ago when things were okay, we would have been laughed out of the place.  At the time I, for one, was being encouraged to get involved in industries that related to providing leisure time activities because we were wondering what people would do with all of their free time as we would be working fewer hours, be more productive and everyone would be in a better situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">Following the Second World War, there was huge social progress in how society was organised.  In the past 20 years, it is unfortunate that the top 1% have garnered more and more of the profits and there is less effort to create a fair society.  It was not just because of the bailout that we are considering increasing the age at which one can draw one's pension.  We must remember that it is only 12 months ago that the French were on the streets fighting on the same issue.  It suits the large corporations and big business for the working age to be increased but it is hardly in the best interests of ordinary people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell</from>
          <p eId="para_1215">I am pleased the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, is in the Chamber and I thank her for putting the Bill before the House.  The mission statement of the Department is to promote active participation in society through the provision of income supports, employment services and other services.  The key phrase is "active participation", which we should promote not only among those in need of social welfare, but also within the Department itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">At a time when we are spending many millions of euro per week in social welfare payments, it is imperative the Department takes measures as set out in the Bill to protect the most vulnerable in our society, for example, the reversing of the minimum wage, the promotion of individual accountability for all applicants.  By allowing the Minister to extend powers to request additional profile information from the claimant, we are able to see positive steps towards accountability and individualisation of the social welfare system.  This information is used to access training and other educational developments and it is with this care and attention that we must approach social welfare claimants to ensure they do not get lost in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">The "one size fits all" approach is not viable in our society.  For example, in my own constituency, I spoke to a single mother recently who instead of taking the route to long-term social welfare put herself back into education.  However, she is surviving on food stamps from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  It is time for us to think outside the box in terms of standardised packages within the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">To seek a reduction on the annual €20 billion social welfare budget, we cannot start by punishing those who are relying on these payments.  We must tackle the increasing issues of social welfare fraud and this means creating deterrents for those who have misled the system in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">I commend in particular the section of the Bill which promotes active participation with employers to ensure there is no growing black market employment which undermines taxpayers and drains resources.  It is necessary for Department inspectors to be permitted to work alongside the Garda and customs officers to investigate such instances and I welcome that measure.  Employers should not get away with taking advantage of those on jobseeker's allowance who may be tempted to earn additional moneys fraudulently.  This means denying workers a genuine job opportunity that offers a legal contract.  The taxpayer foots the bill for this offence, of course, and therefore it must be taken seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">Fair employment is promoted in this Bill by reducing employer's PRSI, as was set out in both the election manifesto of my party and the Government's jobs initiative.  I refer to Mr. Danny McCoy who stated that this programme "will yield a significant reduction in labour costs and will improve Ireland's attractiveness as a location for inward investment, and will make it easier for employers to take on new staff".  That must be welcomed.  Contrary to what Deputy Cowen remarked yesterday — I am glad he is present in the Chamber — after the Minister introduced the Bill, this legislation does what it says on the tin and I am very pleased to support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">By restoring the minimum wage to €8.65 per hour we can continue to reduce our cost base in a bid to restore our competitiveness without starting with the lowest paid and most vulnerable in our society.  To promote active participation we must incentivise people to work.  Often the social welfare system draw is too strong and it is the taxpayer who loses out.  With regard to the agreement set out by the previous Administration, it is encouraging to see there is a better way of doing things.</p>
          <p eId="para_1222">With regard to the amendments of other Acts contained within the Bill, I wish to mention section 21 which excludes Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas from the Citizens Advice Board.  I am strongly in favour of appointing the best person for the job, regardless of his or her politics, gender or social position.  All appointments should be decided by the expertise and merit of a person's <i>curriculum vitae </i>and ability to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">In order to restore our country's competitiveness, we must take steps to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society are protected and those seeking employment should be given all the support the State can muster.</p>

          <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_1224">I acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  I wish her well in her role and compliment her on introducing the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">I spoke to the Minister about one aspect of the Bill which was alluded to in recent days in the House, including by the previous Minister.  If the area of social welfare fraud was adequately tackled it would be possible to leave social welfare rates as they are.  I noted a uniformity in the debate.  Tackling social welfare fraud must be a priority for this Government and I wish the Minister well in that process.  However, simple measures can be taken from the outset in this regard.  Use of PPS numbers is one such measure that should be examined in more detail.  I reiterate a case in point.  At present if one changes one's car there is no requirement to produce a PPS number when registering the car with the motor tax office.  Data protection rules prevent the motor tax office feeding information to social protection offices which, in turn, are prevented from doing the same with local authorities.  It goes around in a circle.   In the interests of trying to save money we no longer have and protecting the rates for those who are in need, we must iron out such elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">I strenuously impress on the Minister to consider the whole area of the black economy, particularly in regard to the self-employed.  At present in every town, village and city in the country there are self-employed people who are doing their best to ensure they do everything in accordance with the social welfare and tax codes but they are competing against people who are being subsidised through the social welfare system.  This is going on and is known about in every town, village and townland throughout the country.  The current reality is that resources may not be available within the Department to adequately inspect those who are known to be involved in such practice.  I urge the Minister to look at the redeployment of resources within the Department she controls and to ask her Cabinet colleagues to examine whether there are spare resources that might be assigned to this task.  Ultimately, the priority must be the protection of the rate for those who need it and to achieve this savings must be made.  All of us are acutely aware that this country is a financial basket case, as inherited by this Government.  We need to do a great deal more with a great deal less.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, was in the Chamber some time ago.  I welcome the section of the Bill that deals with community welfare officers but believe it could be taken further and involve local authorities, particularly from the point of view of housing.  We have a multiplicity of agencies at present that deal with people who are in dire need and dire straits.  A single one-stop shop that would include the local authority housing agencies must be brought into the equation.  There is a temptation to overlook this proposal and although it may not be for inclusion in this legislation I ask the Minister to pass the suggestion to her colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">In fairness to some Deputies on the opposite side, there has been a welcome for the internship programme enunciated by the Government.  As one who qualified in a profession where it was very difficult to get a first job, and, as a result, to find any job, not having experience, I recognise this initiative on the part of a Government faced with the largest number of unemployed people for a generation.  It needs to be seen for what it is, namely, a start, part of an overall package within this legislation.  It will not be a silver bullet; there is no great panacea involved nor is it a magic wand that will be waved over the country to banish all the economic ills of the past 14 years.  That will not happen overnight.  Any Member of the House who believes it will is in some kind of fairyland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">This will be a long-term project.  I wish the Minister and the Government well.  I welcome some of the comments made, particularly those made by Deputies Mick Wallace and Shane Ross.  That is constructive opposition, which one does not often hear around this place.  I welcome their contributions in particular.</p>

          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1231">We all talk about fixing our economy and balancing the budget.  There are two ways to do this — we reduce what we spend and increase revenue through taxes.  People talk about getting rid of the black economy and getting more people back to work.  We can approach this in two ways.  The first is to go after the social welfare fraud which occurs.  For a number of reasons there has always been a level of this fraud.  One reason is that it is not attractive for people to take a job at a certain level of pay nor is it attractive for a person to offer a job at that level of pay because he or she knows it is impossible to compete.  Deputy Collins spoke of people competing with employers who employ persons in the black economy.  That is true.  One hears of taxpaying, self-employed persons who try to employ workers but cannot compete.  This is happening throughout the country.  As well as the person who offers those terms of employment, there is the person who commissions the contractor responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">Apart from the issue of raising the age for the old age pension, most of the opposition expressed has been about other issues not contained in this Bill which are perceived to be coming down the line, such as the joint labour committee measures.  We must get real about the JLCs but that is probably a matter for another day.  We are restoring the minimum wage to its original position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">It is proposed to reduce employers' PRSI.  All of a sudden, there is a gap between being unemployed and employed, or between giving a job and taking a job.  That is what it is about if we are serious.  This is a pragmatic Bill.  It puts certain steps in place.  The pension change that is being made in the Bill is a reflection of the fact that we are all living longer, thankfully.  Until 1970, the retirement age for pension purposes was 70.  Pension levels were minuscule at the time.  Some eminent State employees have been able to extend their working careers.  A former President of the High Court extended his term by two years because he was still a young man and wanted to continue in his job.</p>

          <p eId="para_1244">We will see.  When the plans for dealing with this Bill were being discussed on the Order of Business yesterday, many Deputies were anxious that the minimum wage provisions be taken out of it so they could vote against it.  I ask Members to take a pragmatic approach to this matter.  That involves trying to create work and give people an incentive to stop relying on social welfare.  The establishment of the national employment and entitlements service and the one-stop shop will facilitate the profiling of those who are on the unemployed list in a particular area and the jobs that are available in that area.  It will be possible to work with those people.  It is something that has been requested for a long time.  Why should it be opposed?  We need to examine the pension proposals in an honest manner.  Deputy Wallace will recall that many people in France objected to the proposal to increase the retirement age in that country from 60 to 62.  President Sarkozy is telling us to change our corporation tax rate.  He can come back and talk to us when he decides to increase the retirement age to 65.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_554">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1249">I welcome the Bill to the House.  I thank the Minister for staying to listen to the debate.  I would like to address two points, the first of which is that it is disappointing that we are having to speak once more about the existence of poverty traps and disincentives to going back to work.  It is disappointing because we have been here before, as a State.  We have learned in the past about what happens when the social welfare system interacts with people on low wages.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a volume of work was carried out on these matters.  Decisions were made in order to remove these poverty traps.  We tried to do all we could to ensure impediments to taking on certain roles did not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">The late Paul Tansey wrote a book on this subject.  He described how this engagement was taking place and prescribed what needed to be done to tackle it.  The options are stark and difficult.  It is right, from a moral and principled point of view, that we do not want to cut social welfare rates.  For reasons beyond our control, average wage rates are falling in the current environment.  A gap has been created.  The incentive for someone to take up employment has been reduced.  If we are to tackle that as a Government, as we all want to do, we have to examine the circumstances in which people access additional and incremental payments.  We need to try to find a way of tailoring that to ensure that as people go back to work, they can retain those payments for a period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">The second point I want to emphasise, which was made by the Minister in her speech, relates to the establishment of a one-stop shop.  She said we need to ensure we have a far more integrated approach to the payment of benefits and ensure people are in a position to go back to work.  The observations that were drawn in the recent ESRI report on the operation of those systems were absolutely damning.  I would like to refer to three of the report's conclusions.  First, the report found that an unemployed person's chances of entering employment decreased by 17% if he or she had participated in a FÁS activation interview.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1253">The interviews in question are supposed to be about trying to make clear to people their options for going back to work.</p>

        <speech by="#LukeMingFlanagan" eId="spk_557">
          <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_1254">I am surprised their chances do not decrease by even more.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_558">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1255">That statistic is a damning reflection of the quality of the interventions we are making available to people.  These organisations — I do not doubt that they are full of good people — are engaging with human tragedies.  It is really damning that such an observation has been made by an impartial organisation.  The Minister's proposal to establish a one-stop shop is essential if we are to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">The second conclusion of the report to which I would like to refer is the fact that those who sign on after losing a job, and who have claimed unemployment benefit in the past, are excluded from active assistance in job searches and training.  If it is true that those who have been unemployed in the past are disbarred from participating in the processes that are meant to be getting them back to work, one has to wonder what the people in question are actually doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">The third aspect of the report I would like to mention is the section dealing with the interaction between the Department of Social Protection, FÁS and other organisations that are involved in this area.  The report suggests that one in four unemployed people who are eligible for State assistance are not identified by the relevant authorities.  Such observations and conclusions castigate, frankly, the spending of so much money on support for the unemployed by organisations that are involved in trying to get them back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">I would like to conclude on a positive point.  When we speak about those who are coping with the tragedy of being unemployed, we should acknowledge that the 465,000 people in question constitute a great bank of talent and potential for our nation.  The fact that the organisations involved with them are failing, as identified in the report I have mentioned, is in itself a reason to support this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1261">I have to say I was surprised to learn that the Minister, Deputy Burton, believes very little was going on in the Department of Social Protection when I was the Minister in that Department.  I will deal with that in a second.  I was delighted to note in the five-month Exchequer returns that the departmental Estimates are holding up very well.  In fact, the Department of Social Protection is €68 million ahead of profile.  It is better than profile because extra income is coming in.  At the end of the day, what counts in any Department is the bottom line.  The bottom line in this case is that it is €68 million better off than it was profiled for at the beginning of the year.  That shows how robust the Estimates prepared by the previous Government were.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">At the weekend, the Minister for Social Protection was reported as saying she feels the outgoing Ministers were only there in body during the dying days of the previous Government.  She is said to have said: "I have a feeling from my observations in Government so far that Government Ministers mentally departed the space maybe 12, 18 months ago."  She went on to speak derisively about the Tús scheme.  I will come to that in a few minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">I was in the Department of Social Protection for ten months before the general election was called.  I was appointed to that position at the end of March 2010.  I will set out what I achieved in that time.  The day I entered the Department was the same day the Taoiseach announced that FÁS was to be broken up and its employment services were to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  From a standing start, by the end of the year FÁS was operating under the aegis of the Department with a detailed service level agreement in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">We had agreement in principle that the staff of FÁS would rejoin the Department once the IR issues were resolved.  The activation schemes that were being operated by FÁS came in under the remit of the Department from a policy point of view in September and two of the schemes, that is, the community services programme and the rural social scheme, transferred fully into the Department from 1 September.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">We were putting in place a comprehensive approach, on which I hope the Minister will build, to interlink the employment action programme with the activation schemes in a clear hierarchy that I laid out time and again during my time in the Department.  Every unemployed person should be contacted, at regular intervals but particularly at the one year crossroads because we know that it is the juncture beyond which people find it very difficult to get employment, and interviewed with a view to getting him or her a job and, failing that, education or training.  Failing all of those options that one should be given, one would have the option of going on a work scheme.  I recall that I was not a month in the Department when I asked the Chief Medical Officer, a fine doctor, about the ill effects of unemployment.  He gave me two pages which were quite devastating on the effects on people of unemployment and lack of activity.  We were creating a quick, efficient way of facilitating people who were genuinely unemployed, but we were also creating a net that would catch those who were working and drawing social welfare at the same time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">My belief was quite simple, and we had moved tremendously far in this direction, but it all seems to have stopped since because I understand there is nobody on the Tús scheme.  My belief was that all those I know who are genuinely unemployed would much prefer to be working in some community project than sitting at home every day but those who are working and unemployed, when one challenges them to take work, suddenly find they are too busy and they sign off social welfare.  Before I left the Department, we had started doing primary trials and a new roll-out of the EAP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">The Minister is wondering what the Tús scheme is about and I will explain it.  It is a work scheme as opposed to CE, which is a training scheme.  My idea was that everybody who is unemployed should get an offer of a place on a community scheme rather than being totally unemployed.  The Minister might ask why 5,000.  She validated the 5,000 places because it was my belief that I would not roll out more than 5,000 in one year and therefore I could not spend the money.  My understanding is that the Minister is way behind the targets I set for the roll-out of that scheme, particularly in the case of the sports scheme which not has happened and where we intended having people employed as coaches in the spring.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">Regarding disability, we brought in the partial capacity scheme, but we are still waiting for the regulations, which I am told will not be ready until September.  The idea of the partial capacity scheme was that for the first time ever, instead of seeing persons with disabilities, we were talking about their abilities while recognising that, depending on the level of disability, one would need to retain some of one's social welfare payment.  One could work long term and full-time if one wished.  We had passed this scheme whereby we would grade the level of disability and one would retain that payment but could go and get any employment one wanted.  There was no limit on it, in either duration or pay, and if one could not sustain the employment, one went back on one's full invalidity pension.  We intended following up rapidly, once we had it up and running and got over its trial phase, and extending that scheme to the large number of people who receive disability allowance so that we move away from the negative concept of forcing those on disability payment to stay out of the workforce.  As the Minister might also remember, or they might have informed her in the Department, we also made the advocacy services for persons with disabilities permanent in my time in the Department.  Unfortunately, I am under time constraints here and there is much to get through.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">When one checks under the pension heading, we had quite a bit of work under way on the issue of bringing the defined benefit schemes into a different spot than they were in; I had extended the date to July.  However, we have matched that with the legislation we brought in for the sovereign annuities, the idea of which was quite simple.  Insurance companies, instead of buying bonds in Germany and exporting our money to Germany or buying high-risk equities, would buy Irish sovereign bonds over a 30 year period at a better interest rate than they get in Germany.  This would mean that defined benefits funds which are now in trouble would become more solvent and the Government would not have to borrow this money abroad because we would be getting the money from our own people.  As no doubt the Minister has been informed in the Department, there is €70 billion of Irish workers' money in pension funds.  It is all in equities, in a small amount in cash and in bonds worth €20 billion.  Those bonds are 95% German or French — the vast majority are German.  We had it all ready to go.  The NTMA was ready to roll it out and I have heard nothing about it since we left Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">On the mortgage interest problem and the issue of debt, we received the report in the autumn and I left behind me — I kept a copy of it — a clear path to deal with some of the issues that are in the mortgage interest supplement.  It was lined up for the spring — the Bill before us now is a summer Bill — and would have changed the mortgage interest supplement scheme to get rid of some of the unfair rules contained in it, particularly the 30 hour rule.  This is particularly devastating for couples where the lower income earner remains in employment but is caught by the 30 hour rule.  Some couples are in desperate situations trying to pay their mortgages.  However, we have not seen this reform.  The Minister stated all the changes she will bring in and that we had been doing nothing.  However, we left it ready for her to do and she cannot seem to get it done.  There were other changes there but, again, I am running out of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">The public services card is another matter we had progressed.  We had got to the point where the contract was awarded and we were ready to roll it out.  The card will be a great way of tackling fraud.  We know the three issues in fraud.  The Minister identified one of them, the one-parent family payment which is very difficult to police.  The second one is working and drawing, which is a challenge.  The way to deal with it is not to spend more on inspectors but to challenge people with work.  If they take the work then that is perfectly legitimate and if they do not, the Department calls them in, at which point one will find they will sign off fairly quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">We also completed the transfer of community welfare officers to the Department.  As the Minister will be aware, at present they are departmental staff on secondment.  There are some IR issues that need to be tidied up.  That had been going on for many years.  The transfer happened on 1 January this year.  As I stated, that was something that had been worked on by many Ministers before me but in my short time in the Department, we resolved the issues that had been there.  They came in to the Department on secondment and there were merely some final small IR issues with which no doubt the Minister will also deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">We also brought in three social welfare Bills.  Those Bills were quite substantial.  One was a primary rates Bill but it also contained legislation to do with partial capacity, lone parents, etc.  During my time, we made legislative changes to try split up the appeals process, which is a major challenge for the Department.  I also worked hard in conjunction with the Department.  If the Minister checks with the officials, we held special meetings about this to try look at administrative ways of speeding up the appeals process.  Considerable progress was made in that regard during my time in the Department.  I hope that such work is continuing but I must say I do not see much evidence of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">In addition, I resolved the miners' issue.  This involved miners who had worked in the coal mines around the country, such as in Arigna, Ballingarry, Castlecomer, etc., but had not in my view — it was a case made by the Opposition at the time — received just reward for the disability they suffered.  We set up a mechanism to review their claims on the pneumoconiosis issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">I understand payments continue to issue because of the swift, prompt and, if I may say, humane attitude I took with the full support of my officials in the Department, especially the Secretary General and the Chief Medical Officer, to deal with the issue.  It did not hit the headlines.  There was one "Prime Time" programme about it but because we dealt with it speedily and in a practical way, which they recognised as sensible, it did not hit the headlines and they did not have to knock on my door twice.  I simply dealt with it when it came my way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">I was also involved in a radical overhaul of the rent supplement scheme.  I note the new Government is, rightly, going along the same lines I was developing in terms of transferring people from rent supplement after a fixed time.  My belief is no one should be on rent supplement for more than one year.  Furthermore, we must ensure that all rental properties are pre-registered.  I was working with the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on this issue at the time.  The idea of the tenancy being registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board after one had the tenant is like staying in a hotel and when the hotel is being registered with Fáilte Ireland, it receives a standard check after the guests move in.  It always seemed bizarre to me.  Work was under way on that issue as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">Also, we worked on the issue of removing payments for non-interactive young people on social welfare to encourage them into activation where we gave them the full payment.  All of us know as parents that the worst thing that can happen young people is that they get into the habit of unemployment.  This was not to save money.  The purpose of this was to encourage young people and to make them immune from peer pressure in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">Many other issues arose when I was in the Department including the issue of the spouses of self-employed people and the problem that arose which, again, was swiftly solved when I went into the Department.  It was trying to claw back moneys from women that were to be paid to them as pensioners and that issue was resolved quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">I wish to highlight two further issues related to the Bill, including the row back from the €100 payment in the internship programme.  We introduced the internship programme, the Tús scheme and so on as extra tools to provide activation and then as a way to chase those who were working and drawing.  We were going to pay an extra €100 per week to those in internships.  I note that this has gone from €100 per week for 12 months to a nine month to six month scheme, which is regressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">The final issue I wish to raise amounts to a total sleight of hand.  When those in government now were in opposition they were great at referring to stealth taxes.  They referred to people doing things in a behind-the-door fashion.  I examined the Bill carefully, including section 11, and then I read the explanatory memorandum on section 11.  It occurred to me that something awful funny was going on.  In the ultimate stealthy way of doing things, the explanatory memorandum outlined that the universal social charge, USC, would be deductible as is income tax and PRSI when one is carrying out a means test for the family income supplement.  What it did not outline explicitly and what was carefully avoided was that it will not be deductible in other cases, despite the decision I made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">Let us consider the means test for unemployment assistance.  As the Minister is aware, there are many families in which there were two jobs and in which the main income earner is now unemployed and the subsidiary income earner is earning a modest wage.  To carry out a means test, one takes the gross means and one subtracts the PRSI — one used to subtract the health levy as well.  One should also subtract the USC.  Then one takes €60 off the amount if one is working more than three days per week and then one multiplies the total by 60%.  That is the means.  However, the Minister has declared that it will not be done in this way but that it will be calculated on the basis of the gross income.  The PRSI will be deducted but we can forget about the USC which will be left in.  If one is paying €20 in USC per week, it will reduce the difference between the two decisions to €12 per week.  Why does the Minister not state as much in the explanatory memorandum?  Why was the Minister not upfront in stating that we cannot afford it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">I am surprised with the way in which this thing was worded.  The Minister was clear that she was deducting it in the family income supplement but it is totally glossed over in respect of the jobseeker's allowance in any of the papers I have seen or in the briefings I have heard about.  The Minister should do the honourable thing on Committee Stage and ensure the universal social charge is a deductible charge.  I am aware of the arguments those in the Department will make but the Minister should think of the people from whom she is taking the money.  All of these people are means tested and not well off.  The universal social charge should be a deductible cost in respect of the means test for the jobseeker's allowance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_1283">I refer to the issue of section 13(2) in the Bill.  I welcome the strengthening of powers for social welfare inspectors who participate in multi-agency checkpoints.  As a representative of two Border counties, I have seen too much participation in the black economy by people outside our jurisdiction over the years.  I have seen too many genuine employers suffer because of underpricing by competitors from outside the jurisdiction who have been able to employ people at a lower cost, to put it mildly, than our locally registered employers.  No one is keen on a police State but it is necessary to give adequate powers to all people participating in the multi-agency checkpoints, including the Garda Síochána, the Customs and Excise and social welfare inspectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">It is important that fraud is eliminated as much as possible.  Will the Department give some indication of the progress that has been made in the elimination of fraud?  Much has resulted from the elimination of cross-Border fraud, if we may term it as such.  I realise substantial progress was made during Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív's time in the Department of Social Protection and during the time of his predecessor, Ms Mary Hanafin, as well.  I welcome the heightening of awareness.  Having come across the multi-agency checkpoints many times while travelling through my constituency, I realise that it sends out a clear message to people that the State will not tolerate fraud.  When fraud is tolerated, we deprive genuine people of their due entitlements and we deprive employers and employees.  It is not simply about the quantum of money that could be saved, which is important as well, but the message will be sent out that there will be a level playing field.  Since we have a land Border and the country is divided, this particular problem exists right along the Border and it is one that must be continually addressed.  I welcome any measure that strengthens the ability of our officers from whatever Department or agency they work.</p>

        <speech by="#AnnPhelan" eId="spk_563">
          <from>Deputy Ann Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_1285">I wish to share time with Deputy Eamonn Maloney.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">I congratulate the Government and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, on bringing the Bill before the House.  I preface my words by stating that fraud does not take place only in the social welfare system.  Fraud is at large in the country in general.  Most reasonable people would consider that if this amending legislation did nothing other than give legal effect to the restoration of the minimum wage rate from €7.65 to €8.65, then it would be worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">Most reasonable people would consider that the shameful act of cutting the lowest-paid workers pay perpetrated last year by the previous Government was its final act in a line of similar races to the bottom.  A cut in the minimum wage a few weeks before Christmas 2010 was reminiscent of the Dickensian era, to say the least.  Employers could have used the opportunity to squeeze the lowest-paid workers in the State by slashing their wages, the episode, in effect, becoming a shabby form of exploitation.  To add insult to injury, the official line at the time was that this was all part of an effort to ensure a competitive economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">The prevailing question on everybody's mind was whether the 11% reduction in the minimum wage implemented last year proved beneficial to businesses teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.  The previous Government soon discovered that our economy could not be fixed by cutting the wages of the poorest workers.  The measures in today's Bill will offer a huge boost to low-paid families, particularly part-time workers whose numbers include a disproportionate amount of women.  They will also boost the morale of non-unionised workers and young people.  Equally, they will show how foolish were the cosy captains of some of our employers' associations in claiming that a reduction in wages for the poorest workers would be good for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">On reading the proposed amendments one is struck by the extent of the difficulties faced by the Minister arising from the EU-IMF deal.  Her room for manoeuvre is limited.  However, I welcome the stimulus measures included under the jobs initiative.  I refer in particular to the halving of employer PRSI and the introduction of a national training fund levy.  I recognise the integrity of our national social welfare scheme, which depends on fairness in its allocations to those in our society who have been hit by hard times as much as it depends on the management of scarce resources to prevent fraud.  As the net contributor of funds, taxpayers are demanding the best possible stewardship of their contributions so scarce resources go to those who merit them.  In this regard, I welcome the inclusion of stronger measures to be extended to the social welfare inspectorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">I compliment the Minister on concentrating our minds and efforts through her revamping of the national internship scheme.  Jobseekers will gain invaluable benefits from placements in the private, public, community and voluntary sectors.  Internship, as a mentoring scheme, provides the opportunity for students to be paired with a professional who will act as counsel in aiding their advancement in the working arena.  Internship experience will comprise an essential element of their course of study and add practical experience to their academic knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">I assure the Minister of my willingness to work with her in her efforts to reform the social welfare system in a manner that includes jobs and fairness as its cornerstone.  As members of the Labour Party and of the Government we must subscribe to the ethos of a people at work.  As the Minister stated, we need to emphasise the value of work and the value of opportunity.  This programme will provide that opportunity and I greet it as a much welcome departure from the paralysis of the last Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonnMaloney" eId="spk_564">
          <from>Deputy Eamonn Maloney</from>
          <p eId="para_1292">I support the Bill.  In regard to the minimum wage, there has been much dispute about the rationale for the rate reduction in the first place, but most people have come to their own conclusions about that.  One of the best observations I have heard was when a woman who works in the cleaning industry said to me at the weekend that it was a Fianna Fáil Minister who reduced the minimum wage and it took a female Labour Party Minister to restore it.  An interesting aspect of this issue is that, traditionally, the bulk of low-paid workers comprises women.  We can talk about how scandalous the reduction in the rate was and what an easy target low-paid workers were for the previous Government.  However, all of that is over.  I congratulate the Minister on the speed with which she has honoured the commitment made in this regard.  We in the Labour Party and our Fine Gael colleagues in government are proud that this commitment has been followed through.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">Some Members have had stress pains about supporting this Bill because of the provisions regarding retirement age.  However, the reality is that this provision relates to business that was done in this House on a September night in 2008.  Since the new Dáil met on 9 March this year it has been difficult to have a discussion about any legislative proposal without noting the connection to the decision made that night.  Members of Sinn Féin and the Technical Group — the highly technical group, one might call it — have stated they cannot tolerate the proposed increase in retirement age.  I remind them, because there has been an attempt in the last three months to rewrite or brush out what happened that night in September 2008, that some of their number participated in bringing us to where we are.  Fianna Fáil Members, who have all left the Chamber, are quick to point the finger while forgetting the actions of their party and the Green Party in government.  There are members of the Technical Group who were not Members of the House at the time and I do not wish to be unfair to them.  However, some of their number were Members of the last Dáil and were quick to come into the Chamber to vote for the blanket bank bailout.  Sinn Féin also voted for the guarantee which, incredibly, gave depositors and bondholders the same status.  The proposals we are considering today are necessary because of work done by these people in September 2008.  They have some explaining to do.  It is extraordinarily hypocritical of the architects of our difficulty to point to this side of the House in their objection to the proposal to increase the retirement age.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_565">
          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_1294">I am pleased to support this Bill.  I very much welcome the restoration of the minimum wage to its previous level.  I also welcome the halving of the rate of PRSI to 8.5% in respect of workers whose income does not exceed €356 per week.  The hallmark of any Government should be its fairness, and these are fair and progressive measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">The allocation of resources to social welfare must be viewed in the context of an activation programme.  We are already moving in that direction.  For example, I compliment the Minister on developments in her Department in recent weeks which have seen a greater integration between FÁS and social welfare offices in terms of finding people jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">While one must tweak issues in every case, I wish to raise an issue I encountered recently, whereby someone was offered a job by FÁS that involved commission only.  This must be re-examined and reformed as such a scenario, in which someone refuses a job that was commission only, is not quite fair.  The jobs for which people apply must be seen to be sustainable and must pay a fair and reasonable wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">I now wish to turn to the self-employed.  I was self-employed for 14 years and this group will play a key part in bringing Ireland back out of recession and we must encourage an entrepreneurial culture.  At present, those who set themselves up as self-employed, many of whom will fail given the current climate, will not qualify for jobseeker's benefit because they pay a stamp S, rather than a stamp A contribution.  Although such people will qualify for jobseeker's allowance, that payment is means tested and many such individuals will have assets of a complicated nature.  Moreover, the system has not evolved to allow the Department of Social Protection conduct examinations that would allow it to process such cases in normal time.  It can take three or four months before such individuals are deemed to be eligible to be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.  A fair system must be developed whereby a person who pays a stamp S contribution can receive jobseeker's benefit for a reduced period, such as, for example, three to six months.  Moreover, the process by which the review for jobseeker's allowance takes place must be speeded up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">On the basis of fairness, social welfare fraud must be cracked down on because many people who are in genuine need of social welfare are getting a bad name because fraud also is taking place at the same time.  Consequently, one must ensure the credibility of a scheme.  I have strong views in respect of social welfare fraud and it is welcome that the Minister is committed to dealing with this issue and intends to examine it in a structured but fair fashion.  I wish to make one reference to the subject of social welfare payments and getting people back into work.  A system must be found by which people are encouraged to return to work and that avoids scenarios whereby people who are offered jobs will lose many additional entitlements.  A period must be established over which people can return to employment, while retaining some entitlements such as, for example, a medical card on a phased basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">I note section 10 of the Bill provides for the transfer of the supplemental welfare allowance to the Department of Social Protection, which I welcome.  I also note the Minister's comments to the effect that administration of the rent supplement scheme is to be transferred from the HSE to the relevant local authority.  I wish to make a few comments on the aforementioned scheme.  Apart from the issue of who administers the rent supplement scheme, there must be reform in this area.  The rent supplement scheme was established as a temporary measure but has become a permanent scheme on which €600 million per annum is being spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">Members will be aware that if one participates in the rent supplement scheme for more than 18 months, one qualifies for the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which is administered by the local authority.  However, the controls in place for the latter scheme are much more stringent and the same controls should now apply to the rent supplement scheme.  I will explain in simple terms how this arises.  At present, someone who has a housing need and who seeks rent supplement is directed by the local community welfare officer to the local authority to demonstrate he or she has a housing need.  However, at that time, no proper reviews are conducted of those who seek rent supplement and they are taken onto the scheme.  Moreover, people can remain in receipt of rent supplement for an indefinite period.  However, those who opt for the rental accommodation scheme face Garda clearance and review.  A tax clearance certificate for the landlord is required, agreements are made between the landlord and the local authority and between the landlord and tenant and, in addition, an agreement is made regarding anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">From my perspective, the area in which the greatest number of difficulties arise, certainly within various areas of Limerick, is the rent supplement scheme.  I suggest a simple measure, namely, the introduction of the procedures that obtain for the rental accommodation scheme into the administration of the rent supplement scheme in whatever incarnation it appears after coming under the aegis of the local authorities.  When dealing with the public purse, one must be seen to be both fair and to have mechanisms in place in respect of social welfare fraud.</p>

          <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
          <p eId="para_1302">I thank the Cathaoirleach.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le gach Teachta a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht seo.  Go háirithe, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a thug a dtacaíocht do na réitigh éagsúla sa Bhille agus go mórmhór, dóibh siúd a labhair faoin scéim intéirneachta.  I thank all Members from both the Government parties, as well as the spokespersons for FiannaFáil and Sinn Féin, as well as the various Members who spoke on behalf of the Technical Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">A key purpose of this Bill is to establish a functioning national internship system for those who cannot get work experience.  They may have qualified, finished their apprenticeships, primary or masters degrees or other training but cannot get a job in the current economic climate because they do not have experience and cannot get experience because they cannot get a job.  Since my appointment, I have been working with a wide variety of organisations and have been visiting and meeting people to encourage organisations in the public, private, voluntary and community sectors to give people who cannot gain experience for their <i>curricula vitae</i> a chance to gain valuable work experience.  Such programmes exist in the United States in particular, as well as, for instance, in the European Union and in many European countries.  Basically, they constitute a bridge for people who have achieved certain qualifications but who simply cannot get their foot in the door with regard to getting a job.  I am happy to note a high level of interest and co-operation has been shown by various organisations in creating the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">I wish to point out there is a difference between this scheme and those which had been announced previously.  I acknowledge the former Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, has observed that he had set out a national skills development and internship programme and that he also had set out another scheme called Tús.  However, although 5,000 places had been allocated to each of the aforementioned schemes, on becoming Minister I was somewhat surprised and disappointed to find that no one was participating in them.  While 5,000 places were available in theory on each scheme, nothing had happened.  In the case of the internship scheme, the problem was that by the end of April, only 195 companies had expressed an interest.  A problem that arose pertained to the scheme's structure and the top-up payment.  Under the new scheme, the top-up of €50 will be paid by my Department, whereas under the Fianna Fáil scheme, it was to be paid by the supporting organisation.  Clearly, this caused major problems for community and voluntary organisations for example, as well as for many small businesses.  Consequently, in this case my Department will pay the €50 top-up and this will clear a number of the technical difficulties that unfortunately applied to the scheme set out by the former Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív.  Similarly with Tús, although two small pilot schemes had been set up, no one was actually participating in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">I am highly confident that under this scheme, which will be innovative and will be a first start in Ireland, many people will gain valuable experience.  It is critical to prevent younger people, particularly young men, from going on social welfare where six months becomes a year and one year becomes two years.  National and international surveys have shown that long-term unemployment is extremely damaging to the individual and to their families, particularly their children.  As a society we want to do everything we can to prevent young people slipping into long-term unemployment.  It gives me no pleasure to see young men who were able to get well-paid jobs five or six years ago working on the buildings and who now stroll down together to their local social welfare office and where being on social welfare becomes a lifestyle.  We have to try to change that mentality in this country.  We have to give people opportunities and alternatives.  I am determined that social welfare does not become a long-term feature of the lives of young people, but rather a system which encourages them and offers them opportunity and a chance to go back to education and training or to take on work experience and internship.  This scheme will begin in a modest way with 5,000 places and I appreciate the support of Deputies for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">Deputies on all sides welcomed the restoration of the minimum wage and I thank them for that support.  They will have noticed two complementary measures in the Bill, including the reduction by half in employers' PRSI rate for employees on low wages.  The reduction of the minimum wage rate hit the people in employment who are most vulnerable.  The restoration involved is worth €40 a week to a worker earning the minimum wage.  While some might say they would like it to be more, the restoration of €40 a week is very important, particularly for women workers and those in part-time and occasional employment and young workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">Fraud is another issue that is raised constantly.  Section 12 provides for profiling.  Shortly after I became Minister I published a report commissioned by the Department some years ago which examined the success rate of those interviewed by the national employment activation programme and who were offered various types of FÁS training.  The report was done by the ESRI for the Department.  I asked the ESRI to publish it so that all interested parties in this vital area of getting people back to work, education and training could study it.  It showed that the success rate of the current system is quite limited either because courses do not suit people or people waiting for interview were never interviewed and for other reasons seem to have fallen through the system.  In some cases, having been interviewed, some people's opportunity for getting a job receded rather than expanded.  Every party in this House needs to think about how we are spending vast amounts of money on social welfare and employment and training supports.  We need to concentrate on the schemes which really help people who have become unemployed, the vast majority of whom are anxious to get back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett seemed not to like the idea of profiling; I think he used the term "harassment".  I am aware that the current pilot scheme on profiling is being carried out in Dún Laoghaire and there has been only one complaint so far regarding questions about educational background being asked of the people signing on.  It does not take a lot of thought to suggest that a young person signing on might, in the current jobs market, consider going back to education to complete secondary education and look for other training so as to be able to get employment in areas and sectors where employment is available.  I am happy to say that the individual in question completed the profile.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">As Deputy Smith noted, section 13 gives additional powers to my Department to participate in joint teams with Revenue and the Customs and Excise to set up multi-agency checkpoints in some areas along the Border.  Every euro saved on fraud is money that could be given to legitimate social welfare beneficiaries and to pensioners who need income support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">I watched last night's television programme on TV3.  The people were giving the information anonymously but it was shocking to see people who had been receiving jobseeker's allowance for four years detailing a variety of scams they were using to steal from the State.  They are stealing the incomes of pensioners and others in need of social welfare support.  Since I became Minister I have met the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and the key personnel in Revenue who deal with fraud, along with the anti-fraud teams in my own Department, to examine what additional levels of co-operation are possible.  Social welfare is a contract and the people paying PRSI and PAYE must have confidence that their contributions to the social welfare system are spent well and targeted at those who need social income support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">The public service card will be rolled out later this year.  The Bill provides for additional powers to demand surrender of the card where it is believed it is being used illegally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">The contributions of many Deputies on all sides reflected the need to reach a balance as regards social welfare fraud.  We want a system with good social welfare supports for people who need them, but equally we need very strong measures to prevent fraud.  I am determined to send out a message that in the next couple of years there will be a progressive increase in measures to deter and detect fraud from its inception.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">Deputy Paschal Donohoe mentioned the issue of poverty traps and I refer also to rent supplement, an issue mentioned by a number of Deputies.  Rent supplement probably constitutes the biggest employment trap in the system.  When I became Minister I asked my officials to work out the figures.  A family of a couple with three children who are renting a house with a rent supplement for a figure between €700 and €1,100 a month, an average of €1,000 a month, means a differential of €12,000 a  year.  If that person gets a job, he or she is looking at a total package of supports, between a social welfare income and various child supports, the rent supplement and a medical card, worth in total up to €38,000 a year approximately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">It is very difficult for somebody in that situation to face losing his or her rent supplement valued at €12,000 a year.  I wish to advise Deputies that I am working closely with the Minister and Ministers of State in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to make rent and housing the responsibility of local authorities and transfer responsibility for rent supplement to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">In regard to appeals, shortly after I was appointed Minister I appointed nine new appeals officers, all of whom are experienced, to significantly strengthen the number of appeals officers in the Department.  I hope that over the next few months as they complete their training it will result in a considerable reduction in the time taken to process appeals which I know is a matter of enormous concern to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">The creation of the one-stop shop framework of community welfare officers and bringing the employment services side of FÁS into the Department will in the next year or two mean that more people will be able to apply and get their benefits at their local office rather than having, as currently happens, to go from a social welfare office to a community welfare office and perhaps even to a FÁS office.  We are bringing them all together in one stream at one location.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">I commend the Bill to the House and thank those Deputies who have supported it, in particular the restoration of the €1 an hour cut in the minimum wage.</p>

        <speech by="#MaureenOSullivan" eId="spk_568">
          <from>Deputy Maureen O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_1453">I will share time with Deputies Wallace, Pringle and Catherine Murphy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1454">Central to the matter of spent convictions is the philosophy which believes in our capacity to change and that, having made a mistake, committed a crime and done wrong once or perhaps several times, we are capable of reform, learning from our mistakes and getting our lives back on track.  Ireland does not have legislation providing for expungement of minor criminal convictions.  Every other country in the European Union has such second chance legislation and its existence has not resulted in chaos in the countries in question.  What Ireland has is a revolving door with the same people from predominately the same areas going in and out of prison like clockwork.  For this reason, we need more incentives to discourage people from pursuing a life of crime and experiencing the revolving door to prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_1455">A criminal record is a barrier to employment, education, training, travel and insurance and banking services.  The current position means the punishment lasts a lifetime.  The Irish Penal Reform Trust believes the absence of legislation of this nature is "a recipe for reoffending and for people being trapped in a cycle of poverty and exclusion for the rest of their lives".  We do not want to leave those who offend thinking there is no point in trying to change.  We give prisoners the right to vote, but we do not give them enough chances to get themselves back into the community where they can play a meaningful role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1456">I wish to look at the issue of people with drug convictions.  Many families and communities have been affected by drugs, with some being convicted of possessing drugs.  They are trying to get their lives back on track, but a conviction casts a long shadow even though it could date from a time when they were younger.  Nonetheless, they have paid the penalty, gone through supported training and adult education, and may have families.  They are trying to play a part in family life while giving something back to the community where they may earlier have caused havoc.  In addition, they often try to be an inspiration to others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1457">The north inner city has many programmes offering rehabilitation, personal development, further education and training.  There are incredible success stories involving individuals who are now reaching their potential and making great progress.  However, they will be blocked from further advancement by the lack of such legislation and therefore I am asking that they should get a second chance.  The private sector has been active with a mentoring system in business, so we need the public sector to take that on also.  We basically want to keep people out of prison and this is one way of doing so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_569">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle</from>
          <p eId="para_1458">I support this Bill which is welcome and timely.  In reality, such legislation should have been passed years ago by this House in order to give people a second chance by expunging their records.  I welcome the fact that the Government has accepted the Bill and that it can be amended on Committee Stage.  However, the six month sentence period for spent convictions is too short and conflicts with the Community Service Orders Act passed by the Dáil some weeks ago.  It should be increased to 12 months at least, with consideration given to extending it to two or two and a half years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1459">The Bill contains a list of excluded employments for which it will still be necessary to declare a conviction.  I estimate that every public sector job is excluded under this Bill, so there are approximately 500,000 jobs for which people with previous convictions could not apply.  More thought needs to be put into the type of exclusions listed and where they should apply.  For example, there is no reason somebody who had a public order conviction should be excluded from being an accountant.  Therefore more thought should be put into the proposed exclusions and what jobs they may relate to.  That matter should be given serious consideration in preparation for Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_570">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace</from>
          <p eId="para_1460">The Bill is definitely welcome and will certainly improve how we run the country.  The idea that the Irish will embrace the notion of forgiveness is to be welcomed also because, at the moment, it does appear that we are a pretty unforgiving lot.  If a person commits a crime we punish him, but the principle behind such a punishment was, first, to deter reoffending and, second, to rehabilitate the offender.  If we are to welcome such a person back into society, we must give him a clean bill of health in order to start again.  If such a person is to have a tag forever, it reminds me of Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>.  In that story, a girl who was presumed to have committed an offence was obliged to wear a letter on her dress for three years to signify the crime she had committed.  In the context of this Bill, a lack of forgiveness is very unfair.  The six month period is a bit crazy as well.  All crime needs to be forgiven unless it is very serious and the offender is a danger to society.  The blanket ban on certain areas of employment is completely unfair also.  If we want to give people an incentive to reform, we must offer them a chance to move back into society with a clean bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1461">I will finish on the notion of forgiveness.  Members may have read in the newspapers that there is a possibility I could be declared bankrupt and, if so, I will get thrown out of this place.  I think it is an absolutely ludicrous idea, however.  In this State one is bankrupt for 12 years, which is very unforgiving.  It is one year in Britain and America for most bankruptcy offences.  One can commit many different crimes and still not be thrown out of this House, but if one is declared bankrupt one is, seemingly, not fit for purpose here.  When they brought in the law in 1923, one was considered a moral degenerate if one happened to become bankrupt, and one was no longer fit to be in the ethical House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_571">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_1462">I broadly support the concept of the Bill.  As others have said, it is not perfect but it is a start and can be amended.  The very purpose of the criminal justice system is to deter undesirable behaviour through sanctions, to remove persons from society whose behaviour is thought to pose a threat to the common good, and to rehabilitate those individuals in order that they can be reintegrated into society.  It is vital to consider if there is a benefit to society in retaining conviction records indefinitely and if not how long we should retain them.  If society does not benefit from retaining these records indefinitely and the individual is precluded from participating fully in society by not being allowed to work in certain professions, such records become a negative element against the very purpose of the criminal justice system.  The Bill is an opportunity to amend the law so individuals who have served their sentences and pose no threat to the common good can be allowed to participate fully in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1463">The Bill contains a list of exclusions but many people who have committed white collar crimes over the years have not attracted convictions.  The latter group would not be subject to the same kind of sanctions.  For example, however, one cannot be a public servant under the list of prescribed exclusions and so one could not sweep the streets or work as a hospital porter or in a post room.  Even menial but important jobs, such as cleaning or bin collection, would be excluded for people who may have committed a minor offence when they were younger.  In later life, however, when they may have a family to support, they could be excluded from holding such jobs.  Such people should be encouraged to re-engage in society, but cannot do so if these exclusions are to be introduced.  That matter will have to be dealt with on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1464">There are many people who have been a danger to this country and for whose decisions we will pay a huge price, yet they may never end up with a conviction.  If a blind eye is to be turned or if it will not be possible to prosecute them, there must be a better arrangement for those who may have made a mistake early in their lives and who are paying a disproportionate price for that later on.</p>

          <p eId="para_1465">I call Deputy Joe McHugh who I understand is sharing time with the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, and Deputies Seán Kenny, Michael McNamara and Terence Flanagan.  There will be six minutes per Deputy.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_1466">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  It is worth noting that while Deputy Calleary has been vocal on this matter, his former ministerial colleague Barry Andrews was also proactive in this area.  We can all talk in unison if we are looking at giving people a second chance in various walks of life.  Everybody should have that opportunity.  There are sensitivities, anomalies and complexities within this legislation that need to be addressed.  The possibility of non-disclosure will arise only after seven years have passed without a further conviction when a sentence of imprisonment has been imposed or after five years in other cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1467">The Minister, Deputy Shatter, will be proactive and he has made indications to that effect in the first few weeks of this Dáil term.  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled, he referenced the Children Act whereby teenagers under the age of 18 have an opportunity for non-disclosure in this respect when applying for certain jobs or seeking to travel abroad.  Obviously there are certain crimes where the non-disclosure aspect would not kick in.  However, a person who has a black mark against him or her for a misdemeanour that warranted imprisonment for a period of less than 12 months or a fine but who did not have previous convictions, on reaching the age of 18, will not come within this reference provision and will have to carry that black mark against him or her for the rest of his or her life.  That is where the challenge lies in this respect.  We must examine the proposals in the Bill and acknowledge the possibility of non-disclosure for an individual with a five year clean slate and a seven year period in the case of an individual who had a sentence of over 12 months.  That will have to be worked out.  A consultation process headed by the Minister is ongoing.  He has committed to legislation on this in the legislative programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468">I cite the example of a person I will be careful not to name.  He has done well.  He was over 18 years of age when he committed a minor misdemeanour and he is carrying that black mark against his name and is conscious he will continue to carry it.  It was a first offence.  He was in a group setting.  He was not given adequate and responsible legal advice that would have resulted in him realising a different outcome from the one he got.  However, he continued to see the positive side and was ambitious in going back to college. He continued to be proactive in trying to better himself.  He now has a job that requires him to travel all over the world.  He has a special skill for which there is a major demand throughout the world and is required to travel to many countries but he is under pressure every time he goes through certain airports wondering if somebody is looking over his shoulder or where he stands in regard to this conviction.  That example is a case study of a person who took the progressive route of trying to better himself and is somebody who deserves a second chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1469">My second point is on foot of many conversations I have had with social workers.  For those who have been given a third strike and have gone through the JLO system for offenders under the age of 18 years, there is not enough support in terms of social intervention.  It is not good enough to send people to Mountjoy and St. Patrick's Institution if there is a proper alternative, which would be some form of a community setting whereby in respect of such minor misdemeanours an arrangement could be made at a local level.</p>

If that was the case, the social interventions that should follow, namely, some form of social support from social workers are not in place because the obvious and only alternative is for them to go to the AA.  There is not a positive intervention in that respect.  There should be social interventions for minors through social work and proper rehabilitation.  They are not in place and that is something on which we must be sharply focused.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPerry" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_576">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy John Perry)</from>
          <p eId="para_1473">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Spent Convictions Bill 2011.  I am glad that my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, has decided not to oppose the Bill and supports the principle underpinning it, that the rehabilitation and integration of persons with past convictions is worthy of encouragement.  I understand his Department is currently engaged in extensive consultations with other Departments and relevant agencies with a view to finalising a Bill for submission to Government in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1474">It is important to note that this Bill does not provide for the removal of offences from a person's record.  For those who may benefit from the provisions of the Bill, it means they will not have to disclose that they have a conviction.  There are people who have been convicted of relatively minor offences years ago and have not had any convictions since, yet they feel those convictions still hang over them like the sword of Damocles.  It is important that this matter must be examined.  However, not all convictions will benefit from the provisions of this Bill and it is important to note that serious offences such as sexual offences or other offences which receive long sentences cannot be covered by this legislation, the purpose of which is to remove obstacles to employment.  In terms of job creation in these times, it is important that people who have been convicted of a minor offence will be given a second chance, as Deputy McHugh stated.  Sex offences must always be disclosed, irrespective of the length of sentence imposed or the subsequent conviction free period.  No employer or potential employer should be put at risk by the introduction of this legislation nor should any vulnerable person be put at risk.  It is vitally important that employment involving children or any vulnerable persons is excluded from the remit of this legislation and I believe it is the intention of the Minister for Justice and Equality to incorporate that important fact in his Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1475">It seems unfair that people who were convicted of relatively minor offences years ago should carry that burden for the rest of their lives as these are not repeat or serious offenders and some of them may have progressed in their careers in the intervening years, as in the example cited by Deputy McHugh.  It is important that people who may have committed a minor offence in their youth and have had that offence on their record when they have sought employment would be given a second chance.  While the offence has occurred and the conviction will remain on the person's criminal record there will be no obligation to disclose it in certain circumstances.  However, the obligation to disclose a conviction will remain in the case of certain employment applications such as child care, public service etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1476">I understand the new Bill will build on the recommendations in the 2007 Law Reform Commission Report, an important document, and will seek to achieve a fair balance between incentivising offenders to remain conviction free and enabling them to get on with their lives on the one hand while on the other hand ensuring public safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1477">I look forward to the debate on the Bill which will be brought forward by the Minister following the conclusion of the consultations currently under way by his Department.  I thank Deputy Calleary for introducing this Bill at this time and I have no doubt he and his colleagues will make significant contributions to the debate during the various Stages of it.  It is important that people are given a second chance and it is worthy that following rehabilitation they can get meaningful employment.  I thank Deputy Calleary for bringing forward this Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1478">I very much welcome the Bill, which will allow for the reintegration of ex-offenders into society where the sentence they were handed down is under six months imprisonment or a fine.  The conviction under certain circumstances can be regarded as spent.  I also very much welcome the thoughtful contributions of a number of parties, the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which will be reflected in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479">This Bill is very much a step in the right direction for citizens and for Ireland's standing in the world.  Ireland is almost unique in the EU in lacking legal provision in this area.  Given that the largest proportion of those who were sentenced by Irish courts received short-term prison sentences, fines or community-based sanctions for non-violent offences, the lack of a possibility to have a criminal conviction deemed spent after a certain period is a disproportionate consequence, arguably one that constitutes an additional punishment that lasts a lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480">This situation has far-reaching consequences for those who are sentenced for criminal offences.  Individuals with even minor criminal convictions face ongoing restrictions and barriers in employment, training, education, travel, taking out insurance and many other areas of life.  These are people who were convicted of relatively minor offences many years ago and who have since had no contact with the criminal justice system.  Some have moved on to good careers, but still believe their convictions are hanging over them.  Others fear that, if they try to move job, their past will come back to haunt them.  These are people who made mistakes at an earlier point in their lives and were convicted of relatively minor offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481">According to the Minister, since taking office he has been struck by the number of people who have written to him urging the progression of this legislation.  Indeed, I have recently been dealing with a constituent, a young man who is having difficulties getting a visa in a non-European jurisdiction because he has one conviction from almost a decade ago that resulted in a fine for drunk and disorderly behaviour.  In these difficult times, we must sadly watch our young people emigrate.  Surely it is only fair that, when a person emigrates, he or she is able to get his or her life back on track without an old conviction for a minor offence hanging over him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_1482">There must be a balance in the legislation.  I wish to make a number of points in this regard.  First, after a reasonable period, a person should be able to move on and not need to declare a previous conviction for relatively minor offences, particularly when applying for a job.  This is the point of the legislation, namely, that our criminal justice system should not only punish where appropriate, but also rehabilitate.  Second, certain offences such as sexual offences must always be disclosed, no matter the length of the prison sentence imposed or the amount of time since release that the person has been free of convictions.  Third, certain sensitive types of work, such as work involving children and vulnerable people in society, in the field of justice and in State security, should be excluded from this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1483">The final two points support employers.  No employers should be expected to operate in the dark and risk the reputation of their businesses as a result of the introduction of legislation of this kind.  Neither can it put vulnerable persons at risk.  This is why only minor offences are considered in the legislation; sexual and other serious offences are excluded.  This is in the interest of the public and the State.  The public must be able to feel safe and, to that effect, the proposals on spent convictions would undermine the legitimate requirement that those who wish to work for the State in sensitive roles or for the providers of care will still be subject to vetting.  The Government Bill explicitly provides that An Garda Síochána may disclose spent convictions where information is requested by an employer in respect of any excluded employment.  For the avoidance of doubt, I will repeat that individuals convicted of sexual offences will not be able to benefit from the Bill's provisions.  There can be no allowance in this regard, something that the Bill makes crystal clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1484">The Bill is fundamentally about people with convictions gaining access to employment, but it is necessary to preclude some types.  This should not mean that somebody convicted of an offence that would be deemed spent were the job in a particular field should be debarred from employment.  Reasonable employers should consider whether convictions are relevant to the jobs on offer and, where they are not, should not allow them to influence their decisions.  Prospective employers have a key role to play in the rehabilitation of offenders, including their integration into the workforce.  This legislation supports employers, but it should also support employees.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcNamara" eId="spk_578">
          <from>Deputy Michael McNamara</from>
          <p eId="para_1485">I do not propose to break with the unanimity of the Chamber in supporting the Bill.  I join with my colleagues on this side of the House in commending Deputy Calleary on reintroducing this welcome proposal.  While it requires considerable work before it can be enacted, it is an important step in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1486">We are all aware of the importance of rehabilitation in our criminal justice system.  It is one of our sentencing regime's four purposes.  That persons are or can be discriminated against for the duration of their lives when seeking employment because of something that, as Deputy McHugh described, got out of hand in their early years is a situation with which the entirety of the House disagrees.  On that basis, the Bill is a welcome step.  However, it has some shortcomings that will need to be redressed on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1487">One of the Bill's main features is that it applies to sentences of no more than six months imprisonment or where fines are imposed.  It is not entirely clear that it would apply to community service orders, but whether this is the case will become more explicit.  That the Bill only applies to sentences of six months duration is particularly problematic, as any of the great number of offences triable in the Circuit Court will be excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1488">The possibility of non-disclosure applies only after a conviction-free period of seven years, which is a long time following, for example, a suspended sentence of one year.  People involved in the criminal justice system would regard such a sentence as being relatively minor.  It is important to note that non-disclosure does not apply to certain offences, in particular, offences triable in the Central Criminal Court.  These include serious offences such as rape and murder.  They would not be covered anyway because of the six-month rule, since they would attract sentences considerably in excess of six months upon conviction, but they are being specifically excluded, which is an important measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1489">The Bill requires that persons who are applying for practically any public service position would need to declare their convictions.  While there are justifications where the positions are sensitive, such as the administration of justice or the courts system or caring for or working with children, it is difficult to see how such a blanket exemption in respect of the entirety of the public sector is justifiable.  In the current circumstances, it is arguably discriminatory that all public service positions should be covered in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1490">I reiterate my support for the Bill and I commend Deputy Calleary on reintroducing it to the House.  I look forward to the shortcomings being addressed on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_579">
          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_1491">Like most Deputies, I congratulate Deputy Calleary on putting the Bill back on the agenda.  That all Members have adopted a consensual approach is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1492">The Spent Convictions Bill will regard certain convictions as being spent for certain purposes where the convicted person has not been convicted of any other offence within a specified period.  When implemented, the net effect of the Bill will be that, while a conviction will remain on a person's record, he or she will not be obliged to disclose it when applying for a job.  This is a good provision that moves with the times and gives someone a second chance in life, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493">The Bill introduces the concept of a rehabilitated person, that is, someone who will not need to disclose a spent conviction during, for example, a court case in which he or she is involved.  It is important when people are applying for jobs in this most difficult climate that nothing holds them back.  This legislation, when enacted, will allow people to be judged on their merits rather than on any particular mistake they made in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494">The rehabilitative period in regard to a person who has been imprisoned is seven years and in respect of a person who has been fined or received a non-custodial sentence is five years.  However, this timeframe will be extended if the person is caught up in another conviction.  A shortcoming of this Bill to which the Minister, Deputy Shatter, referred is that it does not mention the number of convictions that may be spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1495">On exclusion of particular convictions, a person who appears before the Central Criminal Court or is convicted of a sexual offence with a minor will be excluded from the provisions of this legislation.  It is necessary we do not legislate to allow such people non-disclosure of what they have done in the past.  Also, we cannot legislate to allow people in sensitive positions, in particular people working in the Health Service Executive dealing with children, who have committed an offence relating to children to have their convictions in that regard spent.  Insurance fraud has been a big problem here in the past.  It is only right that there be utmost disclosure on insurance proposal forms when a person has been involved in insurance fraud.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496">The Law Reform Commission has been seeking enactment of this legislation for some time.  It is timely that Deputy Calleary has brought forward this Bill, which presents the Government with the opportunity to change the law in this area.  This legislation will remove barriers to employment and give people a second chance, in particular those rehabilitated back into society.  As mentioned by a previous speaker, Ireland is lagging behind in terms of our not having enacted this legislation.  Under the data protection legislation records must be kept for seven years.  This puts people here convicted of minor offences at a severe disadvantage with people in other European States.</p>
          <p eId="para_1497">Like most Members I agree with the thrust of the Bill.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, referred last night to the fact that the Bill makes no provision in regard to taxi licences or the private security industry.  We all know of particular venues and taxi drivers in respect of whom there are issues in terms of their past.  All of these matters must be addressed.  People are afraid and we must ensure better regulation and disclosure in this area.  The Minister also stated that the seven and five year rehabilitative periods are unduly long.  The Irish Human Rights Commission has also expressed reservations in this regard.  It is for these reasons the Bill is not being accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1498">I support the main thrust of the Bill, the outstanding points of which will be included in the amended Bill which will come before the Dáil.  The sooner the better.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_580">
          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
          <p eId="para_1499">I wish to share time with Deputy Troy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1500">I welcome the cross-party support for the reintroduction of the Spent Convictions Bill 2011 which was first introduced in Private Members' time by former Deputy Barry Andrews in 2007, with the Second Stage debate taking place in early 2008.  Former Deputy Andrews is to be commended on his initiative in bringing forward this legislation under Private Members' time and in taking the initiative to bring forward a Bill which addressed the issue of spent convictions in respect of which there was, and continues to be, no system in this country.  When introduced by former Deputy Andrews, the Bill received widespread support among the parties.  I am glad it has continued in this vein.</p>
          <p eId="para_1501">I acknowledge the positive approach taken some weeks ago by Government to Fianna Fáil's agriculture motion, also taken in Private Members' time.  It is hoped the Government will continue in that vein whenever positive motions are brought forward by the Opposition.  Fianna Fáil intends to be constructive and to try to contribute in a meaningful fashion to the manner in which this House is run.  It intends the same with regard to its approach to national policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502">A number of Deputies raised in their contributions the question of whether the threshold for spent convictions should be seven years or five years.  This debate highlights the inadequacy of our current system, which provides no such threshold.  It is hoped we will be able to devote more time to this issue on Committee Stage.  The Bill provides that persons who have a conviction for minor offences do not have to disclose that conviction when seeking employment.  It recognises that the most effective means of rehabilitation is through employment, thus allowing the person to reintegrate into his-her community and society.  Employment is probably the best way of restoring a person's self-esteem and enhancing his-her status among family, friends and the wider community.  It has been shown many times that it considerably reduces the likelihood of reoffending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1503">Securing employment is an effective way of achieving the reintegration of convicted persons into society.  This Bill also takes into account the wider interests of society, in particular the protection of vulnerable persons.  The Bill also deals with convictions in respect of which disclosure will always be required, which is important.  While what we are about is ensuring that people who have made minor mistakes get a second chance, we must at the same time ensure that we put in place safeguards to ensure the safety of those citizens who depend on others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1504">The Bill addresses a significant gap in our law.  There is currently no system in place to deal with spent convictions, apart from the limited regime provided in respect of non-disclosure in section 258 of the Children's Act 2001.  The Bill provides us with the means to put in place a structured system for non-disclosure of convictions.  This will allow people to move on with their lives, having completed their term of imprisonment or paid their fines or dues to society.  As the law stands, the possibility of those who have a conviction securing employment is diminished.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505">Indeed, it is taken into account by employers when it comes to giving out a job.  The effect of the current situation is that a person who is over 18 when the offence was committed must carry with him or her the consequences of even a minor offence long after the debt to society has been repaid.  This situation offends a view of what is proportionate, fair and reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506">If we consider the number captured by the Bill, more than 60% of sentences in Ireland are on average for a period of six months or less, thus the provision in the Bill will capture a very large section of people.  While this does not mean we should give up on the other 40% in terms of rehabilitation, this measure will be available to those offenders who have short custodial sentences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1507">There is no doubt but that the recidivism rate in Ireland is high.  The Bill does not pretend to address that but it certainly offers some level of hope to those who may make a mistake and be faced with the prospect of carrying it and having to declare it for the rest of their lives.  The intention is that the Bill will be used by judges, probation officers and those working with ex-offenders, in particular by judges when taking into account what sentence to hand down to a person.  When punishing an individual, they must know the threshold of six months for the conviction to become spent and the impact whatever sentence they hand down may have on the person's life.  The Bill will be a useful measure which will allow a judge to advise an offender on conviction and sentence that there exists a facility through which he or she can restore himself or herself to society.  Equally, it will be a useful measure for those working with offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1508">In general, detention must be a last resort in sentencing under our criminal justice system.  The Probation Act is widely used by judges and the youth diversion programme is widely used by the Garda Síochána.  However, we must begin to place more emphasis on restorative justice.  This means that those in custody are not put there lightly.  We do not like to detain people and will use this measure only as a means of last resort.</p>
          <p eId="para_1509">The rationale for this approach is clear in terms of the cost of our penal system, given it costs €91,000 to keep one prisoner in jail for one year.  With that, we still have some of the highest recidivism rates internationally, with 27% of released prisoners serving a new prison sentence within one year and habitual criminality rates rising to 49% after four years.  This shows the current practice is ineffective, wasteful of resources and brings more people into the criminal justice system than is necessary.  These people could serve a sentence that is of value to society by way, for example, of community service rather than imposing yet further costs on the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1510">The major objective of the Bill is to facilitate the rehabilitation of offenders.  It is a worthy objective that benefits not only the individual concerned but also the communities in which they live.  It is in the interests of society that we break the cycle of crime.  There are many ways of doing that but securing steady, gainful employment has to be a key aspect.  That the Bill introduces a method for people to decide when they are obliged to disclose convictions is a key aspect and will reduce the barriers to their re-entry to the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1511">The effect of a conviction being regarded as spent is set out is section 4.  Where a conviction is spent, the person will be treated as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, convicted of or sentenced for the offence in question.  However, the Bill will not entail any deletion of the criminal records held by the Garda Síochána.  The record will continue to exist and the Bill will merely specify those situations in which the details of that record are or are not to be disclosed.  It will apply in cases where a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine or other penalty has been imposed.  The Law Reform Commission report on spent convictions of 2007 gave significant and thorough examination to the sentence threshold and concluded, based on our national policy and practice, that a six-month threshold was appropriate in our circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512">The possibility of non-disclosure under the Bill will only arise after seven years has passed without a further conviction when a sentence of imprisonment had been imposed or after at least five years in other cases.  The Law Reform Commission's report examined this issue carefully and recommended the periods now proposed.  There is a view across the House that this is an issue to which we can give attention on Committee Stage and there is certainly merit to the arguments concerning the timescale for the application of spent convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1513">The Bill sets out a number of exclusions in terms both of offences and certain employments.  In the case of offences, convictions for sexual offences must always be disclosed.  Similarly, convictions for offences reserved for trial by the Central Criminal Court must always be disclosed.  These offences include rape and serious sexual assaults, as well as murder.  As regards excluded employments, the Bill provides it should always be necessary to declare convictions when seeking employment in specified areas of employment.  Section 5(2) of the Bill contains a list of such areas.  Apart from the excluded employments, the Bill requires full disclosure of all convictions in certain other specified instances.  Previous convictions are to be disclosed at the sentencing stage in criminal proceedings.  There are many other circumstances where disclosure may be required, including court proceedings relating to adoption and guardianship of children, as well as cases in which a court considers disclosure is necessary to ensure justice is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1514">I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to all parties working together on Committee Stage to ensure we are satisfied to proceed with it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RobertTroy" eId="spk_581">
          <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
          <p eId="para_1515">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and I thank Deputy Calleary for bringing it to the House.  I welcome the fact the Government, while not embracing the Bill fully, has given a clear indication it will bring forward a similar Bill in the not too distant future.  I hope the Government will remain true to its word as it is important that the reintroduction of this Bill is not put on the long finger.  We have heard during the debate various Members from all sides of the House outlining the various reasons this Bill should be prioritised and brought before the House.  I hope we will not be waiting for a long time to see it before us again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1516">Is there one of us, or one of our families, who could put a hand on their heart and say they have never made a mistake in the past?  Is there any Member here who can claim to be perfect?  There is not.  The current situation is that persons who were more than 18 years of age when they committed an offence must carry that offence for the rest of their lives.  It does not matter how minor the offence was or whether they have repaid their debt to society.  That situation is very unfair.  Any of us who think back to our college days will know only too well how easy it is to get involved in some affair which would not happen in the clear light of day.  It is very important to have the Bill before the House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1517">The aim of the Spent Convictions Bill 2011 is to provide persons who have a conviction for a minor offence the opportunity of not being obliged to disclose that conviction when seeking employment.  Of course, there are exemptions where disclosure will always be required, most notably those relating to employment where there is access to children.  This Bill recognises that the most effective means of rehabilitation is through gainful employment.  Employment restores a person's self-esteem, enhances his or her status among family, friends and the wider community, and has been shown many times to reduce very considerably the likelihood of reoffending.  Securing employment is clearly a very effective way of achieving the reintegration of convicted persons into society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1518">I was in Buswells Hotel today at a presentation given by Philanthropy Ireland.  The man who made the presentation gave me a statistic which surprised me.  He told me that the cost of keeping a prisoner for one year in this country is equivalent to the cost of educating a student to graduate level.  That shows the importance of rehabilitation, of keeping people out of prison and getting them back to work within society, contributing to it rather than drawing on it.  Employment is the key way to ensure reintegration into society.  Unfortunately, some employers who hear disclosure of certain past minor indiscretions will automatically discard candidates, regardless of how good they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_1519">There is another issue.  People may wish to travel but will have restrictions imposed, again because of some minor offence.  They may wish to travel for a variety of reasons, perhaps to experience a different culture or see the world, or they may wish to travel to find employment.  Unfortunately, we all know of people who must emigrate to find employment in the current situation.  There may be cases where such people can travel on temporary visas.  However, when people move to other countries, meet a partner or set up a family, they find it extremely difficult to get a permanent visa because of a minor offence committed in the distant past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1520">This Bill addresses a significant gap in the present arrangements.  At present there is no means of regarding a conviction as "spent", apart from the limited regime for non-disclosure available to minors under section 258 of the Children Act 21001.  This Bill, based on Irish sentencing policy and practice, proposes that a six-month imprisonment threshold is appropriate in our circumstances.  The possibility of non-disclosure would only arise when seven years have passed without a further conviction when a sentence of imprisonment was imposed, or after five years in other cases.  I note that previous speakers consider that the times proposed are too strict and that we should consider having shorter timeframes.  However, they are generous compared with, for example, the conviction periods of ten years in New Zealand</p>
          <p eId="para_1521">It is important to say that although there is universal support for this Bill and for the present arrangements to be altered, a proper balance should be maintained between the interests of society generally, on the one hand and, on the other, the need to allow those who are prepared to rebuild their lives a reasonable opportunity to do so.  Therefore, there are certain exclusions set out in the Bill, in terms of offences and certain employments.  Convictions for sexual offences must always be disclosed.  Similarly, convictions for offences, including rape, serious sexual assaults and murder, which are reserved for trial by the Central Criminal Court must always be disclosed.  In respect of excluded employments, the Bill provides it should always be necessary to declare convictions when seeking employment in specified areas.  Section 5(2) contains a list of such areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1522">There is one issue we may debate to a greater degree when the Bill returns to the House.  The Bill makes no reference to people who seek to join the Defence Forces and we should consider this point.  I know many fine men and women who may have committed a minor indiscretion or offence who would love to serve in our Defence Forces but cannot do so.  No such rule on conviction for minor offences disqualifies people from becoming legislators, elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  People have been elected who have committed minor offences.  If this situation is adequate for legislators it should be all right for enforcers of the law.  That is an issue for the Government to consider when it introduces its own Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1523">I refer to an issue that was raised by previous speakers, namely, Garda vetting.  I am led to believe the current situation is somewhat farcical.  If Westmeath County Council is vetting all applicants for social housing, as is right and proper, and wishes to acquire a Garda report, it sends the application to Mullingar Garda station which sends it to Templemore.  Templemore sends an order back to Mullingar to carry out the vetting and when this is done Mullingar sends the result to Templemore for eventual return to Westmeath County Council.  Talk about duplication.  I know of one instance where a man's housing allocation was held up for the guts of four or five months because a Garda vetting report was awaited.  A measure such as was proposed would help to speed up Garda vetting and is another reason we should welcome this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1524">I look forward to the Government maintaining its commitment to bringing back this Bill which has universal support in the House.  It is imperative that we enact this legislation as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_582">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_1525">I am glad of the opportunity to pass some remarks on this important legislation which was introduced to the House in Private Members' time by my party's spokesman on justice and law reform, Deputy Dara Calleary.  The proposals contained in the legislation are urgently needed to address a number of issues that affect young, and perhaps not so young, people in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526">For a range of reasons, with which all of us in political life will be familiar, as will others, early in their lives many people commit minor offences that can land them in court with a consequent conviction and a blight on their character for the remainder of their lives.  Having learned hard lessons and gained life experience, it can be very daunting for such people to try to regain their place in society's pecking order.  Depending on the familial and societal positions of the individuals in question, it can be quite difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_1527">It goes without saying one's self-esteem and peer status is helped enormously if one has an opportunity to get into gainful and meaningful employment in society.  It is much easier to reintegrate into society if there is no prospect of a further offence.  It is helpful if one's parents and other people are concerned about one's well-being in society.  If one can get into employment, in effect it means the problem of recidivism does not arise in most cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1528">I would like to speak about the reintroduction of this Bill.  It is important to keep all of these things in perspective.  This legislation does not entail any deletion of the criminal records held by the Garda Síochána.  The record will continue to exist, but this Bill will specify circumstances in which the details of that record should not be disclosed.  The Bill will apply only in cases where a sentence of imprisonment not exceeding six months, a fine or another penalty has been imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1529">I wish to set out the background to this measure.  The 2007 Law Reform Commission report on spent convictions gave detailed consideration to the sentence threshold.  Based on the experience of policy and practice in Ireland, a six-month threshold was deemed appropriate in our circumstances.  The LRC report examined the issue and recommended the periods now proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1530">I noted that a conviction-free period is being proposed for these purposes.  As Deputy Troy said, the relevant period that has been provided for in New Zealand is ten years.  I suppose the proposal in this Bill takes account of the particular circumstances in Ireland.  The Bill proposes that the entitlement not to disclose a conviction should be automatic as soon as conditions relating to excluded offences and employment, the sentence threshold and the conviction-free period have been observed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1531">The automatic application of these arrangements is preferable to a system that is more demanding of time and resources.  It is clear that an application system that would entail applications to a court would present a real risk of drawing attention to a conviction that the person in question hoped was behind him or her.  That would defeat the purpose of the legislation before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1532">Deputies on this side of the House are pleased that the Government recognises the urgent need for legislation, even if it does not intend to accept the Bill proposed by Deputy Calleary.  We hope the Government's legislative proposal will mirror closely the key points of Deputy Calleary's proposal.  If the Government assists those who have found themselves on the wrong side of the law for one reason or another in their early or not so early years, it will do a good day's work for society as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1533">Many people can find it hard to get employment, perhaps for family, community or society circumstances.  It is important that any barriers to employment prospects are removed.  If this Bill helps in that regard, it will be most welcome and we will have done a good day's work for our community and for the economic well-being of the country.  As a number of Deputies said, it will help considerably in reducing the cost of keeping people in prison, for example, by reducing recidivism and the subsequent commission of much more serious offences.  It is important to have people in meaningful and gainful employment, in their own interests and the interests of the community and society as a whole.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
          <p eId="para_1534">The attitude to this Bill of the Government, particularly the Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter, is a demonstration of the fresh approach the new Administration is bringing to the business of the Dáil.  As the Minister said last night, we will not adopt a knee-jerk reaction to sensible proposals from the Opposition benches.  Indeed, we welcome such initiatives and will consider them on their merits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1535">Both Government parties supported this Bill on Second Stage in 2008.  Therefore, we will not be opposing it tonight.  Having said that, the Bill as published contains the same limitations and omissions that were highlighted during the debate in 2008 and again over the past two days.  For that reason, the Government will publish a new and better criminal justice (spent convictions) Bill shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1536">During this debate, many Deputies have mentioned that as public representatives, we often encounter good citizens who have found that minor convictions from many years previously are following them and frustrating their efforts to gain employment.  Those people, and society in general, will benefit if they can be fully integrated into society and be allowed to make a worthwhile contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1537">A small number of key variables distinguish this legislation and deserve to be debated.  The first variable, critically, relates to the range of sentences the Bill will allow to become spent.  Most people agree on that aspect of the matter.  We all agree that convictions for sexual offences should never become spent.  That is also the case for offences that are tried at the Central Criminal Court.  There is common ground on the proposition that those seeking to work directly or indirectly with children or other vulnerable people must disclose their convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1538">There are differing views on the length of sentences that should be excluded from the benefits of this measure.  The Bill before the House excludes sentences of more than six months from becoming spent.  The Minister indicated last night that he is open to the suggestion that longer sentences should also be covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1539">Another variable is the length of time that must pass before convictions can become spent.  This Bill follows the Law Reform Commission recommendation that so-called "rehabilitation periods" of between five and seven years should elapse.  A number of contributors have suggested that a minimum period of five years is too long.  The Minister has made the case for a more nuanced approach.  He has reflected on the observations of the Human Rights Commission and the Irish Penal Reform Trust in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540">The third significant variable is the list of excluded employments.  The legislation we are considering excludes the entire civil and public service, in effect.  This is excessive, as the Minister and others have said.  It is difficult to sustain the argument that someone applying for a job in the private sector should not have to disclose a previous conviction, but the same person applying for a job in the public sector, regardless of its nature, should have to disclose such a conviction.  The Government legislation will take a more measured approach to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1541">The debate on this Bill has shown a maturity in the approach of this House to former offenders.  We agree that crime must be prevented in the first instance and that where it occurs, the perpetrators must be brought to justice and pay their debt to society.  On the other hand, there is general agreement that those who serve their sentences, particularly where minor offences are concerned, should not have the fact of their convictions hanging over them for the rest of their days.</p>
          <p eId="para_1542">I commend Deputy Calleary on bringing this Bill to the House.  I thank the other contributors, including Deputy O'Brien, for their thoughtful contributions to the debate.  I look forward to further debates when the Government legislation is published.  I assure the House that the Government will approach the passage of that Bill with the same openness that has characterised its decision not to oppose this Bill tonight.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_584">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_1543">I welcome the Government's contribution to the debate on this Bill.  I refer in particular to the contribution of the Minister of State.  I am delighted that the principle of the legislation has been accepted.  As the Minister of State said, it is very important that people should not be condemned to a lifetime criminal record for something they may have done many years earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_1544">When one reflects further on this issue, one appreciates that younger people in more disadvantaged areas who did not get many opportunities in life are more likely to have convictions than those from more advantaged areas.  When such people are looking for employment, they often face a double disadvantage.  In addition to suffering from the lack of educational opportunities associated with where they come from, they may also have a minor conviction on their record.  The combined effect of both of those factors can keep them out of the jobs market.  I will never forget a young person who came to my office who many years previously had a conviction.  Every time the person went for a job, he got so far and then, of course, the issue of the conviction came up.  It was for a minor offence and still was on the record.  As I stated, this is one case where we will do disproportionate good rather than harm in areas of high disadvantage where more young people wind up with some kind of a conviction for an offence, then mature and keep away completely from crime, but this legacy compounds other difficulties they might have faced in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1545">Taking the points the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, raised, for example, that sexual offences would never be included here, I am very interested in the idea that she could talk about a longer term.  All of those issues can be looked at constructively, on Committee Stage.  For example, there is nothing to say the Bill could not provide that in the case of a sentence on conviction of a year one would need to be ten years crime free, but the more we allow people the opportunity not to have these showing up time and again for matters that have long past, the better.  For example, a person who at age 20 was convicted of a crime, spent a year in prison and reformed completely, has the conviction dug up all the time when the person is aged 40, 45 or 50 even though he or she has probably done an even greater feat than those who never had a conviction by keeping out of crime, but still it hangs over them.  I am very interested in what the Minister of State had to say on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1546">I am also interested in what she had to say about a more nuanced approach.  We can build on the basic idea here and come up with a better and more balanced measure, but it is important that whatever approach is taken is relatively simple for people to understand.  Sometimes we make laws very complex in this House and it would take a barrister to understand what is going on.  It is important when writing law that it would be nuanced and sensible, that it would take a rational and coherent approach but also that it would be easily understood.</p>
          <p eId="para_1547">I was interested also in what the Minister of State had to say about the public service.  There is a basic point, for example, that a job in the public service might not be one with significant responsibility.  It might be a job doing minor maintenance work around a public building.  To say that such a job is totally different from a much more responsible job in the private sector by some magic formula is certainly worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_1548">An aspect of the Government's response is of interest.  As somebody who worked in a Department, and meaning no offence to the good civil servants here, they are always warning one of the pitfalls and trying to make it more restrictive.  It is good to hear where a proposal is being built on and there is talk of making it less restrictive than the original proposition.  I had a device if I wanted to sell a new idea.  I would always make it very tight in the beginning and if I thought that I was making headway, then I could move it outwards.  On the other hand, if one made it very loose or "liberal" in the beginning, the proposal would be thrown out as being unworkable etc.  In following that, it is good that we are talking about a Bill where the criticism is that it might be too tight and that we can loosen it a bit, rather than a Minister coming in stating it is far too dangerous, would be totally irresponsible and we must throw it out on its head.  I am delighted with the reaction of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1549">I would be interested in finding out the Government's timescale on the alternative proposals it wants to bring forward building on this proposal because it is something we should just get on with.  Every day we meet such people.  We all know them.  Let us be honest about it.  If we look at the statistics, young people get into trouble.  We all did crazy things when we were young — some of us did not get convictions for them but it does not mean that they were not crazy — and as we get older, in many cases we get wiser and more sensible.  In a world where we realise that engagement in the workplace is so important, removing unnecessary barriers to the work place is vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1550">Often I have stated that when I went into the Department of Social Protection one of the first questions I asked was the medical effects of unemployment on people.  I asked for two pages and I got them.  I thought I would get a long document; I did not.  The Chief Medical Officer gave me the references to the best medical evidence available which was quite stunning and blunt, that is, those who are unemployed suffer from higher morbidity and higher mortality, they go to the doctor more often and they take more medicines.  It was really gratifying to find out that those who are unemployed suffer more from depression and every kind of medical index one could think of was negative for unemployment, caused solely by unemployment.  The good news in the document was that all of the medical evidence is that re-employment in 99% of cases causes 100% cure.  I remember joking with then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, that if she gave me a good slice of her budget I could reduce much of the illness in the country by employing the many unemployed in doing something useful in society because it is not in the nature of a human being to be unemployed.  We all know the considerable devastation in families and neighbourhoods caused by unemployment and anything we can do to remove the barriers to employment, particularly for those who might find it difficult to get employment, is valuable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1551">I very much welcome that the Bill is being accepted across the House and that there is cross-party agreement on this.  It is the way this side should work where there is agreement.  Obviously, there must be agreement across all parties on certain issues.  The attitude being taken is responsible.  I stated my main concern is when we will get this Bill enacted so that we can say to those who have convictions, who have served their time in one way or another through a fine, time in prison or whatever, and who have served their time in waiting having the conviction on the record that is shown for all employments and with the exceptions in the Bill, that this will not now be held against them in any future application for employment subject to the careful provisions of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1552">Is dóigh liom gur lá tábhachtach é seo don mBille.  Tá a fhios agam gur glacadh le Billí de chuid an Aire, an Teachta Shatter, nuair a bhí sé mar Bhall den Fhreasúra.

Mar a dúirt mé, tá súil agam go dtabharfar an Bille seo faoi bhráid Tithe an Oireachtais go luath agus go ndéanfar é a achtú agus a chur i bhfeidhm.</p>

            <p eId="para_1558">I wish to share time with my colleagues, Deputy John O'Mahony and Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick.  Cross-Border oil smuggling is an epidemic and the State is losing a great deal of revenue.  It is causing unfair competition to legitimate businesses.  It arose because of the carbon tax which was introduced in the Republic in the past year and has added €32 to the cost of 1,000 litres of diesel.  This has made it worthwhile for people to transport diesel.  What are the Customs and Excise and Revenue doing about this?  This matter needs to be addressed.  I await the response of the Minister of State with great interest.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_590">
            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_1559">I raised this issue with the Minister for Finance some months ago.  This is a simple matter.  Millions of euro are being lost to the State through the illegal laundering of fuel and diesel.  This has been caused by the great rise in oil, petrol and diesel prices and it has been an attraction for criminality which has been taken up with gusto.  There is a disparity of 51 cent between off-road and on-road diesel at the moment.  The difficulty has been exacerbated since the beginning of the year with the change in the sulphur content in diesel.  The perception up to now was that this was only a problem in Border areas.  However, this illegal product seems to be mushrooming all over the place and has been detected in Cork, Waterford, Limerick and many other counties, including in the west.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">The Irish Petrol Retail Association has raised this issue and it maintains that it is costing jobs.  The association reckons there are 120 questionable filling stations selling diesel, amounting to 12% of the overall diesel market.  I congratulate the Revenue and Customs and Excise on last week's find in Castleblayney but it epitomised the difficulty and has shown the people that the law of the jungle applies in respect of this issue.  Not only was the find massive, but those involved ganged up on the Customs and Excise officers as they moved away with the dismantled plant.  They have no respect for the environment.  Whatever needs to be done should be done and whatever resources are necessary must be put at the disposal of the Customs and Excise or the law.  The ordinary people and retailers are keen for this to be sorted out.  Whatever needs to be done should be done now.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_591">
            <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</from>
            <p eId="para_1561">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to discuss this important matter with the Minister of State.  The Government has lost a vast amount of revenue throughout the years as a result of fuel laundering.  I congratulate the Garda and Customs and Excise officials for their work in trying to stamp out this illegal activity.  Last week, they made an important find near Castleblayney, County Monaghan.  Recently, I met a group of fuel retailers in County Louth.  They expressed concern that the problem is as bad as ever.  They are having problems trying to compete with people who are willing to purchase this laundered diesel for resale.  It seems that no matter how many people are caught and put out of business it makes no difference to the volume of illegal product available.  It appears those who are prosecuted simply take their medicine and then start up an illegal operation again.  The incentive to do this is great because they can make substantial profits from their operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">There are three problems involved.  First, the Government is losing substantial revenue because of this illegal trade.  Second, the unsuspecting customer who unwittingly buys this laundered product will find that his or her fuel pumps will be damaged over time.  Third, the chemicals used to launder the fuel create toxic waste which is doing untold damage to the environment.  Legal fuel retailers find it impossible to operate with those willing to sell the laundered product.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">In these cases the punishment does not fit the crime.  Since the profits generated from this illegal activity are so great, when those involved are prosecuted the penalties should be equally great.  As far as I know, that is not the case.  I request that the Minister review the legislation governing this activity with a view to ensuring that the penalties that apply in court for breaches of the law are prohibitive.  This action will greatly assist the Garda and Customs and Excise officials in stamping out this illegal activity.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Brian Hayes)</from>
            <p eId="para_1564">I am replying to this important matter on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  I thank my colleagues, Deputies Feighan, O'Mahony and Fitzpatrick for raising it and for bringing it to the attention of Dáil Éireann.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of mineral oil tax and for tackling the illicit trade in fuel products, that the price in Northern Ireland for regular diesel and petrol is higher than the price in the State and that consequently illegal imports of these commodities are not an issue.  However, illegal activity in the form of diesel fuel laundering, which takes place mainly in this State, poses a serious threat to the Exchequer, as the Deputies have outlined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">The House will appreciate that it is not possible to accurately estimate the loss to the Exchequer from individual activities within the shadow economy.  The laundering of markers from mineral oil is one of several excise fuel frauds that Revenue is proactively tackling.  Marked fuel oil, or green diesel as it is more commonly known, is subject to a lower rate of excise duty on condition that it is used for particular purposes such as home heating or as a propellant in agricultural and off-road vehicles.  Its use in ordinary road vehicles is strictly prohibited and there are heavy penalties for anyone convicted of such an offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">There is a considerable difference in the rates of mineral oil tax applied to ordinary and rebated diesel.  The former is taxed, including carbon tax, at a rate of 46.5 cent per litre while the latter is subject to a rate of 9 cent per litre, a difference of approximately 37.5 cent.  Clearly, there is an attractive incentive for criminals to evade the higher rate of duty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">The use of marked oil in road vehicles takes two forms.  In the first, a person simply puts the marked diesel in his or her tank and hopes that he or she will not encounter one of the regular road checkpoints that Revenue officers set up to detect the illegal use.  However, an individual will not be able to continue with this particular method of evasion for long before detection.  Anyone convicted of such an offence is liable on conviction to a fine of €5,000.  If such a person is subsequently detected, he or she will be further prosecuted and his or her vehicle will be seized.  While the illegal use by individuals of marked oil in road vehicles is viewed very seriously by the Revenue Commissioners, the more sinister and potentially damaging to the economy is the large scale laundering of such oil in order to make its detection at Revenue checkpoints more difficult.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">The criminals — this is what they are — who carry out this evasion are solely concerned with making illicit profit and care little about the damage that their activity does to the national economy.  For obvious reasons, the laundering of markers from diesel is usually carried out in remote rural locations.  By its nature this activity creates environmental problems through oil and chemical pollution due to the type of oil laundered, the chemicals or filters employed in removing the markers and the dumped residue.  It can cause serious mechanical damage to the engines of unsuspecting motorists.  Deliveries by un-roadworthy tankers and untrained drivers have caused spillages on national roads and are a serious risk from a health and safety perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">This laundering also damages legitimate trade and facilitates the evasion by rogue garages of other taxes such as VAT and income tax through the suppression of this throughput.  It is the belief of Revenue that without retailers who are willing to purchase and retail laundered fuel, oil laundries would have great difficulty in marketing their product.  To counter this aspect, in 2007 more serious offences and penalties were introduced for persons detected selling or delivering laundered minerals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">I refer to the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick about a review of the law in this area to ensure the penalties are strong and robust enough to deter people from engaging in this illicit and illegal activity.  As Deputy O'Mahony pointed out, previously this was an illicit trade most focused along the Border region.  However, as he rightly observed, this crime is increasingly seen in many parts of the country away from the Border.  The effort to counteract it is an example of the very strong action the organised crime section, the Revenue and An Garda Síochána are collectively taking to pursue those responsible.  We are aware that much more needs to be done and it is an issue with which Revenue is considerably exercised.  I thank the Deputies for raising the matter because of the enormous damage it potentially causes not only to our economy, to the natural environment and to motorists but also to taxpaying consumers and businesses which are operating in a legal and tax-compliant way and whose business is being taken from under them.  We will keep the matter under review.</p>

            <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
            <p eId="para_1571">St. Columba's national school in Cloonagh, Dring, County Longford is situated just outside the village of Mullinalaghta, in a very rural part of the county.  Both Councillor P.J. Reilly and I have been inundated with calls from frustrated families in regard to the proposed threat to the school transport service from 1 September 2011.  This service has been provided to pupils since the 1970s when the two schools in the parish were amalgamated.  A firm commitment was given at that time that if the people of the area agreed to the amalgamation, the affected families would always have access to public transport to bring their children to the new facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">Some 40 years later, the former pupils are now parents themselves and are sending their children to school on the bus.  The service provides support to 18 families in the area, ten of which are paying for the service, covering a round journey of 22 km.  Will the Minister for Education and Skills review this decision, which constitutes an attack on rural Ireland?  For too long rural areas have played second fiddle and been seen as an easy target.  People in these areas have barely recovered from the proposed closure of two-teacher schools.  I am sure the Minister will say that proposal was initiated by the previous Government, and I accept that.  However, the threat remains and the Minister has not put it to bed.  Many people are fearful for the future of rural two-teacher schools, and this latest proposal represents another serious attack on rural life.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">Only three years ago St. Columba's national school benefited under the schools building programme when a new two-teacher building was built and was opened with all necessary auxiliary facilities in place.  The old building is now being used as a community and recreational hall.  The school is part of a small but thriving rural community which also has a church, two pubs and a shop.  As somebody who comes from a rural area and who went to a one-teacher school which has since been upgraded to two-teacher status, I have a great love and affinity for rural Ireland.  The Government must do all in its power to preserve services in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">I acknowledge that the Minister is in a straitjacket in terms of financial constraints, but I understand the Exchequer figures are better by some €200 million than what was anticipated at the beginning of the year.  For a very small sum this service can be maintained for the 18 families which depend on it.  Working parents may be unable to bring their children to school in the absence of a school bus service.  I ask the Minister to review the situation as soon as possible before 1 September with a view to alleviating the fears of these families.  There is a perception that we are seeing an attack on rural Ireland, including on rural schools.  I hope the Minister will allay that fear this evening and will commit to revisiting this decision with a view to retaining the service that is being provided to the 18 families, ten of which are paying for it and are willing to continue to do so into the future.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_1575">I take it the Deputy is referring to the changes in the primary school transport scheme announced in budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government.  These changes, which may have an impact on the school transport service for St. Columba's national school, derive from recommendations in the value for money review of the school transport scheme and include changes to the closed school rule, CSR, and to the minimum numbers required to establish or maintain a service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">Regarding the CSR, there is a number of dimensions to the cessation of this rule.  The first, which will be implemented from September 2011, involves the uniform application of the distance criterion to all pupils travelling under the primary transport scheme, including those travelling under the CSR.  This means that children residing less than 3.2 km from their school of amalgamation will be deemed ineligible for school transport.  Families affected will be notified by Bus Éireann of changes to their transport eligibility with effect from the 2011-2012 school year.  These families may apply for concessionary transport on payment of a charge of €200 in circumstances where there are spare seats available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">The second element of the change is scheduled to take effect in September 2012 and will apply only in the case of pupils commencing their primary education from that date.  This change will restrict school transport eligibility for new pupils to those who meet the distance eligibility criterion and are travelling to their nearest school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1578">Available statistics, based on sampling undertaken as part of the value for money review, indicate that the impact of this element of the change will be limited, as the majority of pupils categorised under the closed school rule are in fact attending their nearest school.  Therefore, the majority of families will not be affected by the change.  That said, I have requested Bus Éireann to conduct a detailed analysis of the impact for individual schools and the rural communities they serve.  Like the Deputy, I attended a small rural school and am very much aware of the requirements of these schools and the challenge they face to survive.</p>

            <p eId="para_1580">Bus Éireann's analysis will be based on the most up-to-date information available on current usage patterns and this information is expected to be available this summer.  The likely effects of this change will then be carefully examined well in advance of the 2012 implementation date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">To put this issue in context for the 2009-2010 school year, transport services under the CSR operated to more than 800 primary schools with almost 26,000 children deemed eligible for school transport under this rule, representing 54.4% of mainstream tickets issued.  The transport of such a significant number of children, some of whom would not qualify for the service on the basis of the distance criterion alone, involves a cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_1582">In regard to the minimum numbers required to establish or maintain a service, the changes include the requirement that from the 2011-12 school year, a minimum of ten eligible pupils residing in a distinct locality will be required to retain or establish a school transport service.  This brings the minimum numbers required to establish services back to 2002 levels.  As is currently the position, families of eligible pupils for whom there is no suitable school transport service available may apply for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.  Bus Éireann is currently undertaking a detailed examination of all such services to establish the routes in question.  Families affected will be notified of changes.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Griffin</from>
            <p eId="para_1583">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the matter of the global pharmaceutical centre of excellence in Tralee.  This is an issue of the utmost importance for the people of Tralee, the people of County Kerry and for the entire south-west region.  When the centre of excellence was first announced it represented an unprecedented ray of hope for Tralee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1584">I remind Members that even at the height of the so-called boom, at one point the town of Tralee had a live register figure that was higher than that for the entirety of County Meath.  Tralee has been an industrial wasteland for almost two decades and this project offered huge hope and optimism for the future.  However, in recent days it has emerged that the project, which has the potential to create up to 5,000 jobs, may be in danger of being relocated to Derry in Northern Ireland.  Since the onset of the recession, the unemployment problem in Tralee and in County Kerry in general has worsened considerably and it now appears as though this project, which was dangled in front of them and looked so positive, will be lost to the people of County Kerry and the south west.</p>
            <p eId="para_1585">The project backers have cited huge differences in attitude between State agencies south of the Border and their equivalents, such as Invest Northern Ireland, north of the Border.  In particular, the IDA has come in for enormous criticism from the backers of the global pharmaceutical centre of excellence.  I call on the Minister of State to assure me, as well as the people of Tralee and County Kerry, that everything that possibly can be done will be done to ensure this vital project stays in County Kerry and does not go north of the Border.  Second, will representatives of the IDA be asked to explain its record on this project and the reason those who back this project have felt obliged to take to the airwaves in County Kerry and to approach the media to complain about that agency?  This must be done if jobs are to be successfully created and if the economy is to grow in the future.  It is not good enough that a State agency should be cited as being so weak, poor and unresponsive when a huge project such as this is offered as an opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">The project backers also mentioned they have been highly impressed and are satisfied with the support they have received from Shannon Development and from the Minister, Deputy Deenihan.  In addition, Kerry County Council and the other local authorities in Kerry have worked hard to try to bring this project to fruition.  However, the IDA is an agency that appears to have allowed this project to slip through its fingers.  Anyone who examines the IDA's delivery figures for County Kerry over the past 15 years will discern the agency already has a disastrous record in the county.  I seek action in this regard as it is not too late.  While this project has not yet departed, it will go unless something is done.  I seek a guarantee this evening that the Government will stand up for the people of County Kerry and the south west and will help to deliver this project.  It is not good enough that there is a possibility that it will be lost.  Too many people from County Kerry have been forced to emigrate or are out of work.  Too many graduates of the Institute of Technology Tralee have no hope because they see no jobs in the county.  Similarly, too many of the leaving certificate students who are sitting their examinations at present wonder why they should even bother going to college because no opportunities will await them on graduation.  This project could be the catalyst that County Kerry badly needs to get its economy moving again and to be a model for the rest of Ireland.  I wish to ensure this project is not lost to the people of the county and I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to intervene.  They should do what is right by the people of County Kerry and should ensure that the global pharmaceutical centre of excellence will remain in Tralee and will lift the county and the south-western region as a whole out of recession.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnPerry" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation" eId="spk_598">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy John Perry)</from>
            <p eId="para_1587">I thank Deputy Griffin for raising this matter, which refers to efforts to develop a global pharmaceutical centre of excellence to be located in Tralee.  The concept involved is to develop and build a multidisciplinary life sciences and pharmaceutical contract research centre in Ireland.  The original concept as outlined my predecessors, to my Department and to the State agencies, was estimated to cost €4.7 billion and envisaged jobs for 116 leading academic professionals, 321 corporate management executives and 4, 380 graduates.  The project was to operate on a commercial market basis, carrying out paid research for clients such as international pharmaceutical companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">Since the project was originally mooted, I understand there has been much local and national political involvement.  The support of the industrial development agencies and of my Department has been available to the proposers to discuss and develop proposals.  In late 2010, the promoters met the former Taoiseach and the former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  However, the proposers have not thus far succeeded in developing the concept to a point where a firm business plan has been proposed.  Being in business, it is important for me to make the point to Deputy Griffin about the necessity of getting the business potential of such a project onto a plan.  Such a plan always is necessary in order that the relevant State agency board, which under legislation is tasked with deciding on how much State monetary aid might be paid to any industrial project, can assess the proposal and reach a decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">In late 2010, an enterprise agencies team, led by the IDA and involving representatives of Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and Shannon Development was set up to examine a plan submitted by the promoters, which related to the original full proposal.  Incidentally, on the issue of Enterprise Ireland, I believe we are well served in this regard.  Moreover, since my appointment as Minister of State, the amount of foreign direct investment into Ireland has been extraordinary.  Consequently, I would be disappointed to hear this is not the case in County Kerry.  The aforementioned group was tasked to furnish its analysis to the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation by the end of the first quarter of 2011.  However, in early February, the then Minister was informed that the backers of the global pharmaceutical centre of excellence had, for the time being at least, withdrawn from the engagement.  An examination of the plan was therefore in abeyance until such time as the promoters of the global pharmaceutical centre of excellence were in a position to re-engage with the agency group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1590">More recently, proposals for a first phase of the project have been in discussion.  It has been indicated that this might involve a number of international research operators and international funding and might have the potential to create approximately 280 jobs.  Again, however, neither a business plan nor an application for State support has yet been submitted.  A lengthy meeting took place last Friday in which Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development advised the promoters on drawing up a business plan and on submitting an application for State financial support.  If the Deputy has contacts with the promoters, I appeal to him to emphasise to them that the business plan is the absolute starting point.  The proposers were given an application form that can be used in a global pharmaceutical centre of excellence application to Enterprise Ireland for financial support.  I hope this can lead to an early application for State support.  In the meantime, I emphasise to Deputy Griffin, who raised this important issue of huge potential to the region, that he may be assured the support and advice of all relevant State agencies and Departments are available to the promoters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">The Adjournment motion this evening refers to a potential loss of jobs to Northern Ireland.  In all negotiations on the location of and State support for mobile industrial projects, it is not unusual for promoters to talk to a number of different countries and State authorities.  In this case however, where it is not yet clear whether a firm proposal will emerge or how many jobs might be involved, it is premature to talk of jobs being lost to any alternative location.  Finally, from a business perspective, this is about the promoters engaging with the State agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and so on.  The IDA has been highly successful in terms of both job retention and job creation and I am certain that were an application to be put on its desk, it certainly would get all possible State support to ensure this potential enterprise was located in the region to which the Deputy refers.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
            <p eId="para_1592">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the important matter pertaining to the services at the three midland hospitals, namely, Mullingar, Portlaoise and Tullamore hospitals.  Options are being considered at present for the three hospitals, including a number of different measures.  Discussions are ongoing regarding the provision of services at the three hospitals with serious implications in particular for acute surgery at Portlaoise hospital.  Last year, the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, was the 11th busiest hospital in the State.  In that year, 41,000 emergency cases were dealt with there and this compares with 24,000 cases in Naas.  If acute surgery is discontinued at Portlaoise hospital, it will have huge implications for both that hospital and for Tullamore hospital.  Tullamore hospital cannot cope with the increased workload, as the staff there already are under severe pressure.  Core services at Portlaoise will be undermined.  For example, the maternity, paediatric and accident and emergency services all rely on and require acute surgery facilities to be in place in order to function properly.  Patient care will be compromised at both hospitals and this must all be considered in the context of growing pressure and longer waiting lists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">I am informed that among the options being considered are to have on-call acute surgery — whatever that means — available for reduced hours or that acute surgery would be taken away from Portlaoise.  The timeframe for a final decision is very short, by 1 July at the very latest.  The new regime will be in place by 11 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">The main issues are supposed to be the availability of doctors who are referred to as the NCHDs, non-consultant hospital doctors.  I am informed that Portlaoise will have an adequate number of NCHDs for July in order to continue with the current level of acute surgery at Portlaoise hospital.  This should not be an excuse.  I also ask the Minister to ensure that Naas hospital is included in the ongoing review of services because this hospital will provide a larger pool of staff.  The other issue is funding.  I know that this presents a challenge for both Tullamore and Portlaoise hospitals and also for Mullingar hospital.  However, services can be maintained with careful management and with existing funding.  I am sure the Department is open to giving a small amount of extra funding to ensure the hospitals do not run out of money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1595">Before the general election, both Government parties, Fine Gael and Labour, gave clear commitments to make health a priority.  The Minister for Health when he came into office promised to take a very direct hands-on approach and to have his Department directly in control of health provision.  I welcome this promise because I have listened for years to nonsense about the HSE being responsible and someone else being responsible, yet here was the Minister having a straight line of responsibility and this is welcomed by Sinn Féin on this side of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1596">However, last week I received a one line response about this major reconfiguration of services in Portlaoise.  The reply stated that the matter was being referred to the Health Service Executive for a direct reply.  That is a very poor response, considering the commitments given.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">I hope that acute surgery will be retained at the hospitals and I hope it will not be ended at Portlaoise, which is the busiest hospital with 41,000 emergency cases last year.  I hope it will not happen under Fine Gael and the Labour Party's watch.  What we need in Laois-Offaly is for the Minister to intervene directly and ensure that the core services and in particular, acute surgery, will be retained in Portlaoise and Tullamore.</p>

            <p eId="para_1598">I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">At national level, the HSE is working intensively to ensure there are sufficient non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in each hospital, following the next rotation of posts due in July.  I can confirm that the provision of hospital services at the three midland hospitals is currently being addressed by the HSE in light of a possible shortage of NCHDs to cover services in Portlaoise, Mullingar and Tullamore hospitals.  The shortage of NCHDs is an issue internationally as well as nationally and the HSE is working to ensure that services in each hospital can continue to be provided safely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">The HSE, in conjunction with the management of the three hospitals, is considering contingency measures aimed at ensuring continued safe delivery of hospital services in the event that any vacancies which may arise cannot be filled.  The regional director of operations in the mid-Leinster area of the HSE is in ongoing communication with the clinical and nursing directors and senior consultants of the hospitals to discuss and develop contingency plans in advance of the next rotation of NCHDs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1601">Hospital management is working with clinical directors in a planned way to devise contingency arrangements which can be implemented in hospitals if required.  A project team has been established, chaired by the clinical director and led by the director of nursing.  Consultative meetings have commenced with clinicians in the midlands and this consultation will continue over the coming weeks as plans are developed.  Clinical expertise with particular emphasis on patient safety issues will inform this contingency planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1602">The HSE is also putting in place a number of processes to address the issues contributing to this difficulty on a short, medium and long-term basis to ensure that hospitals continue to offer a high level of care to all patients.  A recruitment drive for a new intake of non-consultant hospital doctors is under way and a number of other initiatives are being considered, in particular, to ensure that hospital emergency departments continue to offer a high level of care to all patients in a timely and appropriate manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1603">The Minister is committed to ensuring that the issues referred to will be addressed by the HSE and that services at the three midland hospitals at Mullingar, Portlaoise and Tullamore, will continue to deliver the best and most appropriate services to all patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_1617">Department Circular 30/2011 sets out the arrangements for the deployment of resource teaching posts in schools for the 2011/12 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">The Department's approach has allowed schools "roll-over" their existing full-time resource posts on the condition that any surplus capacity in these posts is shared with other local schools.  If the "roll-over" arrangements are not sufficient to meet a school's NCSE approved allocation they must firstly contact their neighbouring schools for any surplus capacity and then, if necessary, there is an application process to the Department for any remaining balance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">The circular also informs schools that the Department will look in the Autumn at its capacity within overall teacher numbers to update the General Allocation hours for learning support in developing schools to reflect increased enrolments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1662">I wish to advise the Deputy that the decision to withdraw Resource Teacher for Travellers was taken by the previous Government as part of the last Budget.  The requirement to make expenditure savings and to ensure that staffing numbers remain within the Public Service Employment Control Framework prevent me from re-visiting this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1663">Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/Teaching Hours for Traveller pupils will be withdrawn, effective from 31st August 2011.  Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching should receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.  All schools should select students for learning support on the basis of priority of need.  Limited alleviation or adjustment measures have been provided to assist schools that have high concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by Resource Teachers for Travellers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">The expected budgetary target reduction in the number of Resource Teacher for Traveller Posts/Teaching Hours for Travellers, based on estimated provision for 2011, was 723 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) posts.  As at the end of January 2011, in respect of the 2010/2011 school year, the actual number of Resource Teachers for Travellers employed amounted to a total of 709.54 WTE posts nationwide.  The number of Whole Time Equivalent post savings in respect of the withdrawal of RTT posts will therefore be 709.54 posts. This will be offset by any alleviation or adjustment posts allocated.  119 such posts have been allocated to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">My Department will also consider whether further limited alleviation measures can be provided for schools who have not received alleviation or adjustment measures to date and for whom it can be demonstrated that they have been disproportionately affected by the decision to withdraw Resource Teacher for Traveller posts, in comparison to schools of a similar size and circumstances.  Under the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers (VTST) will also be discontinued from September 2011.  40 Whole Time equivalent posts will be withdrawn as a result of this measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">Work is ongoing in the Department to identify what can be done within the limits of remaining resources, to address the acknowledged ongoing needs of the Traveller community.  The VTST is managed by the National Education Welfare Board (NEWB) as part of the Integration of Education Services alongside the School Completion Programme (SCP), the Home School Community Liaison Service (HSCL) and the Education Welfare Service (EWS).  Responsibility for the NEWB and its services has transferred to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with effect from May 2011.  Our two departments will work together to ensure that the services in the NEWB, including the SCP, the HSCL and the EWS will have a renewed focus to more effectively target and support children at risk, including Traveller children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1671">FÁS has, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, put in place a number of measures in recent years and in 2011 to enable registered redundant apprentices to progress in their apprenticeships.  The ‘Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme' was introduced by FÁS in 2010 to provide work placement opportunities for redundant apprentices to complete their on-the-job training at Phase 3, 5 and 7.  The scheme has been broadened in 2011 to include placements with employers in both the private and the public sectors.  The scheme, for which €7.3m in funding is being provided, aims to provide work placements for up to 1,000 apprentices in 2011.  As at 27 May 2011, 846 redundant apprentices are currently on the scheme and 118 redundant apprentices have completed their placement with FÁS approved employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">Employers in the private sector and, for the first time, the public sector, may participate in the 2011 scheme provided they meet the eligibility criteria.  The 2011 scheme requires no wage contribution from the employer but instead a standard training allowance of €260 at Phase 3, €350 at Phase 5 and €400 at Phase 7 is paid to the redundant apprentice by FÁS.  Eligible redundant apprentices are referred by FÁS to approved employers to participate in the scheme.  The maximum period of placement is 26 weeks at Phase 3 or 26 weeks at Phase 5 or 12 weeks at Phase 7.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">Other initiatives taken by FÁS to assist redundant apprentices to progress in their apprenticeships include ‘Changes in Progression Rules' whereby redundant apprentices unable to complete their relevant on-the-job training phases are now permitted to progress to the next off-the-job training phase.  Under the ‘Phase 7 Equivalent Assessments Scheme', redundant construction trade apprentices unable to complete on-the-job Phase 7 Assessments at an employer may undertake Phase 7 Equivalent Assessments at a FÁS Training Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">The ‘Recognition of Prior Learning Scheme' allows redundant apprentices who have successfully completed all apprenticeship training Phases 1 to 7, but who have not completed the statutory four years in employment as an apprentice, to validate their competence by submitting a portfolio of evidence of trade related work experience gained at home and/or abroad and/or trade related training and education.  Under the ‘Fee Waiver Scheme', FÁS day and/or evening courses fees are waived for redundant apprentices.  Under the EU ‘Leonardo da Vinci Lifelong Learning Programme', 12 redundant apprentices commenced on-the-job training with employers in Germany in February 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">A number of new programmes for redundant apprentices and craftspersons are currently being developed or implemented by FÁS in conjunction with the Higher Education Authority and Institutes of Technology.  These programmes include a post-Phase 6 Certificate in Craft Transferable Skills, a special course in Advanced Skills for Redundant Plastering Craftspersons, a Certificate in Entrepreneurship for Redundant Craftspersons and short duration courses to prepare apprentices to repeat their outstanding assessments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1677">A review of the criteria and procedures for the establishment of new primary schools has been undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation and its report was recently published on my Department's website.  The report's recommendations and proposals are a useful contribution to the deliberations of the recently established Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector.  A review was deemed necessary given the rapid growth in population and changing demographics in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">The report recognises the increasing parental demand for diversity of school provision and in particular for Irish medium and multi-denominational/non-denominational education.  It will be necessary to consider the report's recommendations and proposals. In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.  In this regard, I wish to point out that approval has been given to recognise a new Gaelscoil in Ashbourne, County Meath, from September 2011 and approval has also been given to recognise a new Gaelscoil in Mulhuddart, Co. Dublin from September 2012.  Both these schools will be under the patronage of An Foras Pátrúnachta.</p>

            <p eId="para_1685">A survey carried out by the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers on Traveller enrolment found that in September 2009, over 11,300 young Travellers were enrolled in school, 8,301 at primary level and 3,014 in mainstream at post-primary.  Progress at primary level has been taking place on a steady basis over the past twenty five years while progress at post-primary level has been more evident in recent years.  The September 2009 enrolment shows more than a doubling of Traveller enrolment in post-primary since September 2000 when there were 1,165 Traveller students enrolled.  Over the four year period to 2009 the number of Traveller pupils sitting Junior Certificate has increased by over 50% from 292 in 2005 to 442 in 2009. Likewise the number sitting Leaving Certificate and Leaving Certificate Applied has more than doubled from 43 in 2005 to 103 in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">While the data point to a fall off before completion of the Leaving Certificate many Travellers remain engaged with education in alternative settings. Youthreach is an integrated programme of education, training and work experience, for young people in the 15-20 age group who have left school early without any qualifications or vocational training.  There are almost 6,000 places available nationwide under the Youthreach umbrella.  The programme is funded by the Department of Education and Skills with some 3,700 of these places provided by VECs in Youthreach centres with the remaining places provided by FÁS in Community Training Centres.  The latest available annual survey (2010) of participants showed that of a total of 6,000 learners, 800 identified themselves as Travellers.  All Further Education programmes are open to Travellers and include both full time programmes (Post Leaving Certificate programme; Vocational Educational Opportunities Scheme; and Youthreach) and part time programmes (Back to Education Initiative; and Adult Literacy and Community Education).</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">The Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy was launched in 2006, following wide ranging consultation with stakeholders including Traveller representatives.  It covers all aspects of Traveller education from preschool to further and higher education.  A core principle of the strategy is that allocation of resources is based on ‘individual educational need' rather than ‘Traveller identity'.  My department's aim is to prioritise the available resources to maximum effect across the education sector to enhance educational outcomes for all children and adults including Travellers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1688">Under the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, the Resource Teaching posts for Travellers will be withdrawn, effective from 31st August 2011.  In order to assist schools, with high concentrations of Traveller pupils, limited alleviation or adjustment measures are being provided.  As such, alleviation measures are being concentrated on schools which had 33 or more pupils supported by RTT posts, based on 2009/10 school year enrolments.  Furthermore Traveller enrolments have been included in the valid enrolment for the purpose of allocating additional staffing under DEIS from the 2011/12 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">The Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers (VTST) will also be discontinued from September 2011 under the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  The VTST is managed by the National Education Welfare Board (NEWB) alongside the School Completion Programme (SCP), Home School Community Liaison Service (HSCL) and the Education Welfare Service (EWS). While responsibility for the NEWB has transferred to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the two departments will work together to ensure that the services in the NEWB, including the SCP, HSCL and the EWS will have a renewed focus to more effectively target and support all children at risk, including Traveller children.</p>

However, as the Deputy may be aware, considerations of State support for minority religions has been an important factor in the provision of funding for such schools, given that much of the fee-charging sector has traditionally been made up of Protestant schools and those with a minority religious ethos.  Such considerations however have to take into account the constitutionality of making resources available to fee-charging schools of one ethos and not to those of another.  Officials of my Department have been in discussions with senior representatives of the Protestant churches and schools concerning the funding arrangements, including funding for capital projects, for their schools. Such discussions are continuing.</p>

This is in accordance with the Budget 2011 decision.  Teachers appointed for the first time also now commence employment at the first point of the salary scale.  Incremental credit for the length of time in college training as a teacher is no longer reckonable.  Regardless of starting pay the remuneration of teachers in the same school will often differ due to a number of factors such as the qualifications held by individuals, the work undertaken by the teacher and the length of service as a teacher.  My Department is also aware that a number of teachers and, in particular, newly qualified teachers are unable to source experience in schools which would allow them to complete teaching practice requirements and so gain full registration with the Teaching Council or indeed to gain classroom and school based experience which may prove advantageous to their future employment prospects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">The FÁS Work Placement Programme (WPP), which allows a business or organisation to take on a person for a work experience placement, was therefore extended in late 2010 so as not to exclude unemployed teachers or non-teaching staff from obtaining placements in publicly funded schools.  Participation in the programme is entirely voluntary and involves a placement for a defined period of time.  Participants may be entitled to maintain their social welfare entitlements subject to the rules of the Department of Social Protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_1699">The <i>www.projectmaths.ie</i> website is operating normally.  The norm, in cases of syllabus reform, is that the State Examinations Commission publishes a sample  examination paper in the first term of the examination year.  In the case of Project Maths, the website contains sample examination papers published by the State Examinations Commission for the Junior Certificate 2011, sample papers for the Leaving Certificate 2010 and 2011, and the actual examination papers for the Leaving Certificate in 2010.  This is supplemented by a range of resources for teachers and students and by comprehensive professional development for teachers.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has also provided examples of questions and materials for schools which are available on its website, <i>www.ncca.ie</i>.  The examination papers are also available on the NCCA and on the State Examinations Commission website <i>www.examinations.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">Project Maths began in all schools in September 2010 in junior and senior cycle, building on the experience of 24 schools which began the initiative in 2008.  The reforms are being implemented on a phased basis over 3 years across five strands of mathematics, and are being refined in the light of the experience in the project schools. As each of the strands are implemented, the examinations for the relevant class years for the strands in question are changed to reflect the new approach.  The initiative is therefore evolutionary in nature for the 24 project schools.  While materials and supports and sample examination papers are being provided, schools cannot rely on a databank of past examination papers, as they could in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">Project Maths is designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics, to reinforce its practical relevance to everyday life, and to ensure better curriculum continuity across the system.  A key objective is to improve attainment levels in Maths and to encourage more students to take the subject at higher level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1707">I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 97, 109, 110 and 115 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">My Department's most recent projections indicate that enrolments at post-primary level will rise from current levels of circa 312,200 pupils to about 336,600 pupils by the year 2017 and at primary level enrolments are expected to increase from the current total enrolment of circa 505,600 pupils to an expected enrolment circa 567,300 pupils by the year 2017.  It is within this context that the Forward Planning Section of my Department is finalising its analysis of all areas in the country in order to determine the level of additional school provision which will be required at both primary and post primary level up to 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">The progression of all large scale building projects, including projects for schools in Kildare, from initial design stage through to construction phase, will be considered in the context of my Department's Multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme with due regard to Forward Planning's recommendations and available financial resources.  The current status of all projects on the school building programme, including those in Kildare, may be viewed  on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i> and this programme will be regularly updated throughout the year.  Details of schools in Kildare who requested permanent accommodation is available on the Department’s website.  A list of schools in Kildare who submitted requests for temporary accommodation in 2011, together with the status of the application is provided as follows for the Deputy’s information.</p>

         asked the

         if he will review the situation in Dún Laoghaire College of Further Education, Dublin, in which, due to a reduction in apprentice places and a cap on student places, six courses are in jeopardy and ten teachers will not be used to full capacity, while ten other teachers will lose their jobs; if he will consider increasing the cap by 175; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Ciarán Cannon)</from>
            <p eId="para_1739">The Deputy will be aware that the downturn in the construction sector has resulted in a significant fall off in the numbers of apprentices being recruited nationally.  In 2009, an independent evaluation panel was established to advise the Higher Education Authority (HEA) in relation to the appropriate levels of provision which should be maintained within the education sector having regard to likely future demand to 2014.   The panel recommended a reduction in provision in Dún Laoghaire College of Further Education (DLCFE) from 24 blocks in the 2009/2010 academic year to 12 blocks in 2014.  The full reduction is being phased in over the period 2010 to 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">In 2011/2012 the college will provide 2 blocks for the first and second term and 3 blocks for the third term, a reduction in provision which will require a reduction of 5.84 whole time equivalent (WTE) teachers in the DLCFE teacher allocation.   DLCFE is an approved PLC centre under the management of Dun Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee (VEC).  On an annual basis, my Department allocates approved Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) places to VECs and other providers.  VECs are responsible for the allocation of places to approved PLC centres under their remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">Dún Laoghaire VEC's current allocation of approved PLC places is 2,151, which includes 28 places specifically allocated for the 2009/2010 academic year to compensate for the loss of apprenticeship blocks and a further 75 places allocated for the 2009/2010 academic year as part of the 2009 Supplementary Budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">Dún Laoghaire VEC's allocation of approved PLC places was maintained for the 2011/2012 academic year.  As part of the recently announced Jobs Initiative, provision has been made for the allocation of a further 1,000 PLC places, targeted at the unemployed.  Providers were invited to apply for these places and I understand that Dún Laoghaire VEC has submitted an application, highlighting the issue raised by the Deputy.  Officials in my Department are currently evaluating these applications and providers will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1744">I am anxious to support the higher education sector in responding to future demand for growth in participation.  This future growth needs to be reconciled with limitations on public resources and a need to protect and enhance core quality.  Although the nature of these difficult trade-offs are described in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030, the strategy also identifies the need for more detailed analysis.  In this regard, I have asked the Higher Education Authority to undertake further work on the sustainability of the existing funding framework over the course of this year.  This work will inform consideration by Government of policy options in relation to future funding of the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1746">I wish to advise the Deputy that the decision to withdraw Resource Teacher for Travellers was taken by the previous Government as part of the last Budget.  The requirement to make expenditure savings and to ensure that staffing numbers remain within the Public Service Employment Control Framework prevent me from re-visiting this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/Teaching Hours for Traveller pupils will be withdrawn, effective from 31 August 2011.  Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching should receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.  All schools should select students for learning support on the basis of priority of need.

            <p eId="para_1749">A total of 81 posts have been allocated to DEIS schools, following the inclusion of Traveller enrolments in the valid enrolment under DEIS from the 2011/12 school year.

Project Maths began in all schools in September 2010, building on the experiences of 24 schools which started the initiative in September 2008.  It is being supported by a comprehensive programme of professional development for teachers which began in 2009 for mainstream schools and will continue to at least 2013.  My Department will also be tendering shortly for the provision of post graduate programmes in maths for teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1754">In science, a new junior cycle syllabus was implemented on a phased basis since 2003 and provides a strong emphasis on practical investigative approaches.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently engaging in a public consultation on revised draft Leaving Certificate syllabuses in Biology, Physics and Chemistry which are designed to extend these approaches to senior cycle.  The Government is committed to an agenda of reform in this area to strengthen Ireland's competitiveness, supported by the work of the professional development services for teachers and the Discover Science and Engineering programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1756">My Department's Guidelines on Countering Bullying in Primary and Post Primary Schools (1993) require all schools to have an anti bullying policy.  It is the responsibility of school management to ensure that the guidelines are followed and if training is required, it is available from the Social, Personal &amp; Health Education (SPHE) support service.  My Department's support teams, the PDST and SPHE provide advice and guidance to schools on a range of school policies including their anti-bullying policies.  In addition, the SPHE Anti Bullying Co-ordinator runs training courses on positive strategies for managing bullying issues.  In the academic year 2010/2011, SPHE supported 1320 teachers from 330 schools and also provided cluster training in Education Support Centres.  Since 2006 SPHE has supported 7,200 teachers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1768">Higher education institutions have collectively agreed to operate a bonus points scheme for Higher Level Mathematics for a four year trial period from 2012 to 2015 inclusive, with a review in 2014.  A bonus of 25 points will be allocated to students who achieve a grade D3 or above in LC Higher Level mathematics.  This pilot scheme has been specifically designed with the objective of maximizing the numbers of Leaving Certificate students who study for and sit the Higher Level maths examinations, and should compensate for the perceived additional workload associated with Higher Level Mathematics, and particularly incentivise the 20% of students who currently move to Ordinary Level having studied Higher Level for most of their senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">A major programme of reform in Mathematics, Project Maths, began in all second level schools at both junior and senior cycle in September last, building on the experience of 24 schools which began the programme in 2008.  Project Maths is designed to encourage better understanding of mathematics, to reinforce its practical relevance to everyday life, and encourage more students to take the subject at higher level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">I also intend to publish a National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy shortly which will provide a continuum of measures designed to improve performance in these critical areas.

            <p eId="para_1775">The EU Commission's report in terms of reading, maths and science is based on the PISA 2009 results. These showed a significant deterioration in the performance of 15 year olds in Ireland in Mathematics and Reading <i>vis-à-vis</i> earlier years. Ireland’s performance in Mathematics ranked as just below the OECD average, and Reading was at the OECD average. In science, Ireland’s score is significantly above the OECD average and is the same mean score as reported in PISA 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">The fall in standards has not been corroborated by evidence from other surveys and must be treated with some caution. Changes in the profile of students, survey fatigue, and the chance inclusion of some very low performing schools were seen by international experts to be factors which partly explain the change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">A major programme of reform under Project Maths is currently under way in all second level schools supported by comprehensive investment in professional development for teachers. My Department is also currently finalising a National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. In science, revised syllabuses were introduced in primary level and in junior cycle in 2003, and the NCCA is currently engaging in a public consultation process on revised syllabuses in Leaving Certificate Biology, Physics and Chemistry. Enhancements to the teaching and learning of science are being supported by the professional development services for teachers and the Discover Science and Engineering Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">In technology, €116.4 million has been invested in 2009 and 2010 under the Schools ICT programme to provide infrastructure, professional development for teachers, digital content and broadband services.

            <p eId="para_1780">The Deputy will probably be aware that, currently, there are four student grant schemes administered by 66 grant awarding bodies (local authorities and VECs) on my Department's behalf. However, earlier this year, the Student Support Act became law. This paves the way to consolidate the four existing schemes into a single unified scheme and I intend that this will happen for the 2011/12 academic year. In addition, plans are well underway to replace the 66 grant awarding bodies with one single authority. I have approved the appointment of the CDVEC to operate this centralised body on a transitional basis subject to the agreement of an operational plan with my Department. The single authority will be operative from 2012. It will accept all new applications initially. Existing grant awarding bodies will continue to deal with the renewal of existing grants on a wind-down basis over three to four years.  I will also be establishing an independent appeals board commensurate with the provisions of the legislation. In tandem with these developments, the on line application facility for students and the payment of grants by EFT continues to be rolled out. I expect that these fundamental reforms will make it easier for students to apply for a grant. They will also ensure consistency of treatment of applications and the timely payment of grants.</p>

            <p eId="para_1782">The process of allocating teaching resources to schools for 2011/2012 and the arrangements for filling vacant or new teaching posts, including temporary posts, takes place in the context of the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland and the Public Service Agreement 2010/2014. It is necessary for my Department to exercise additional control and reporting measures this year to ensure that the numbers of teachers employed in schools is consistent with the EU/IMF Programme of Support for Ireland.  This requires that all permanent and fixed term positions are in the first instance made available to those surplus teachers with either permanent contracts or contracts of indefinite duration.  It is the intention of the Department to restore recruitment from fixed-term teachers on the main panels, supplementary panels or public advertisement at the earliest possible opportunity, after all the surplus permanent teachers have been redeployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">Circular 31/2011 recently issued by my Department sets down rules in regarding the appointment of appropriately qualified registered teachers and is applicable to all appointments made on or after 1 September 2011. Schools will be required to keep a list of appropriately qualified registered teachers who are available for substitute teaching at short notice. Teachers who are available for work will be able to inform schools in their locality and be included on this list. Schools must then use this list or a service like Subsearch or TextaSub when they need a teacher at short notice.  If a school cannot find an unemployed teacher in time, they may then employ a retired appropriately qualified registered teacher. If none is available, it may move on to employ a registered teacher whose qualifications are for a different sector or post giving preference, wherever possible, to an unemployed teacher over a retired one. If a school, despite its best efforts, cannot find a registered teacher it may, for a maximum period of one week, employ an unregistered person, provided that it is satisfied that the person is competent and capable to act in place of a teacher. A school must continue looking for an appropriately qualified registered teacher and, if it finds one in the meantime, the interim person must be let go.</p>

            <p eId="para_1791">As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to Question No. 32 of 14 April 2011, I am deeply concerned at recent reports of the use of force against Camp Ashraf residents in Iraq and the resulting loss of life.  Ireland and the EU are determined to seek a long-term and peaceful solution to the predicament of the residents of Camp Ashraf.  The EU Foreign Affairs Council discussed the situation at Camp Ashraf on 23 May, emphasising the need to respect human rights.  I fully support the Council's view that we must work with the UN (including the UN High Commissioner for Refugees) and US in particular, to seek a lasting resolution to this situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">As you will be aware, Ireland does not have a resident Embassy in Iraq.  However, HR Ashton has clearly set out the EU position, including a strong condemnation of the recent violence in Camp Ashraf, and has conveyed this position in writing and by telephone to Iraqi Foreign Minister Zebari.  I particularly endorse HR Ashton's renewal of the EU's repeated call on the Iraqi government to refrain from the use of violence and to show full respect for the human rights of Camp Ashraf's residents.  I also strongly support her call for a thorough and independent inquiry into the events of 8 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">While there are no easy remedies to the situation in Camp Ashraf, force is not the answer.  Iraq's sovereignty should be respected over the entire territory of Iraq, including in Camp Ashraf, but the human rights of residents of Camp Ashraf must be respected too and the Iraqi government must accept full responsibility for ensuring the protection of all those resident on its territory.  In actively seeking a solution, Ireland and its EU partners will continue to work with international institutions and partners, while calling upon the Iraqi government to grant access to independent international observers, to show restraint and to seek a peaceful and sustainable solution.</p>

            <p eId="para_1832">I know that Revenue has a strong focus on maintaining and indeed improving the rates of timely compliance by businesses with the tax return and payment obligations. Notwithstanding the more difficult economic circumstances in which businesses are operating at present, it is very important that businesses organise their financial affairs in such a fashion as to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. This is essential not just from an Exchequer viewpoint but also because late or non-payment of tax debts puts those businesses who are timely compliant at a significant competitive disadvantage. I fully support what Revenue is doing in that regard to ensure a focus by businesses on paying the right amount of tax and on time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">I know that Revenue appreciates the challenge for business in being timely compliant especially in the difficult economic and financial climate that prevails at present. Revenue has consistently encouraged businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise towards an agreed way through those difficulties so as to quickly restore voluntary timely compliance. In that regard, Revenue has developed an administrative framework to manage such issues, and has published material for businesses experiencing tax payment difficulties on its website at <i>www.revenue.ie.  </i>I am aware that tax practitioners and representative bodies have recognised Revenue’s practical support and assistance to viable businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">Where businesses or individuals experience difficulties in meeting their tax payment obligations on time, in the absence of meaningful and timely engagement with Revenue and agreement on how that challenge will be managed, Revenue will take the necessary action, including enforcement, to secure compliance. Those businesses and individuals who comply on a voluntary and timely basis must be confident that their efforts are recognised through the initiation of the necessary collection and recovery action by Revenue against those who do not meet their obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1835">Revenue is not in a position to say exactly how many companies have been forced to cease trading as a result of their demands for payment of tax debts in 2010. In many instances companies and businesses in difficulty with Revenue will have difficulties with other creditors and it is not readily possible in every instance to isolate the efforts of any particular creditor as the underlying reason for the decision to cease trading. However, I am advised by Revenue that in 2010, 63 companies were wound up by the High Court following the presentation of its petition to the Court for the appointment of a liquidator.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1837">I wish to advise the Deputy that there have been no specific cuts in the School Support Programme to DEIS Band 1 schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and an integrated School Support Programme (SSP). As a result of the identification and review processes, 876 schools (200 Post Primary Schools and 676 Primary Schools) are currently included in the School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS. DEIS primary schools are further subdivided into three classifications to reflect rural and urban status and levels of disadvantage. The current list includes 200 Urban Band 1, 145 Urban Band 2 and 331 Rural Primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">DEIS provides various supports for both primary and post primary schools. These include: reduced pupil teacher ratio in primary schools in urban areas with most disadvantage; allocation of administrative principal on lower figures than generally apply in primary schools in urban areas; additional capitation funding based on level of disadvantage; additional funding for schools books; access to the School Meals Programme; access to numeracy/literacy supports and measures at primary level; access to Home School Community Liaison services; access to the School Completion Programme; enhanced guidance counselling provision at post primary level; access to planning supports; provision for school library and librarian support in post primary schools with most disadvantage; access to the Junior Certificate School Programme and Leaving Certificate Applied; and access to a range of professional development supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS, was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the Department of Education &amp; Skills and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through my Department's Regional Offices and the Inspectorate.  The ERC's overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage set out in the  Education Act (1998), as:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1841">the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1842">While the identification variables selected are, either individually or taken together, reasonable indicators of social disadvantage, it is when they present in high concentrations that they best predict educational disadvantage. This is commonly referred to as the "social context effect".</p>
            <p eId="para_1843">The majority of Irish schools will include among their enrolments a number of children who exhibit one or a number of ‘disadvantage' characteristics. In most cases the school will be equipped to meet the individual needs of these children from within existing resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1844">Evidence from research strongly supports the view that educational disadvantage will occur, to the extent that supplementary supports will be necessary, in schools and school communities where socio-economic disadvantage is most concentrated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1845">DEIS supports and measures are designed to address the needs of schools who require significant additional resources to supplement and support the mainstream teachers where the enrolment consists of a high percentage of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1846">The set of measures included in the National Recovery Plan 2011 to 2014 impacts on every sector of the public service and will unquestionably lead to significant challenges for schools as well as my Department in the coming years. The major challenge will undoubtedly be to seek improved outcomes for children with fewer resources.  A key focus of my Department's Social Inclusion  measures will be to retain resources, where possible, in DEIS schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>

It is necessary for my Department to exercise additional control and reporting  measures this year to ensure that the number of teachers employed in schools is  consistent with those programmes.   Schools can only fill their vacancies from the surplus permanent and CID holding teachers. It is not possible to permit schools to fill vacancies in any other manner until the surplus permanent teachers are redeployed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1854">The value for money review on small schools is part of the normal review processes undertaken by all Departments on an annual basis on selected areas of expenditure and is being conducted in line with the standard procedure for value for money reviews. These procedures require that the views of stakeholders be obtained and the public consultations were designed to achieve this aim. This was done by issuing a direct invitation to relevant interest groups to provide a submission. The interest groups included the school patron bodies, management bodies, teacher unions, national parents' council, Irish language groups and other groups who operate in the area of social inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1855">The review will attempt to explore the general policy options for re-organisation of small schools including the sharing of resources and clustering arrangements towards small schools. I think it is important to clarify that this study is part of an overall requirement across all Departments to have a rolling programme of such studies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">This review was initiated last October by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and is not driven by any ideology. The study is simply about ascertaining the facts to inform future policy. It does not mean that any policy decision has been taken at this point or that any particular outcome is sought. Given that the Government has recently announced a Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, all Government expenditure and programmes will come under similar scrutiny.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">The terms of reference acknowledge the important role primary schools play in their local communities. In considering any policy change in relation to small schools, I am conscious that there is a wider dimension to be considered in addition to the cost of maintaining small schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">Among the issues that will need to be taken into account are questions such as availability of diversity of provision, ethos of schools, parental choice, language of instruction, travel distances, transport costs and the impact of schools on dispersed rural communities. The review will examine the locations of small schools relative to each other and to other schools of a similar type. It will also examine the costs of running small schools and the educational outcomes associated with small schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">Educational quality for the students must be one of the main criteria in any consideration of primary school size. We must also consider the needs of local communities and wider social and cultural factors. Decisions on school provision and reorganisation must be widely perceived to be cost-effective, equitable and reasonable. These decisions need to be based on a rigorous evaluation of requirements and needs, not just at a local level but also at both regional and national levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1860">The review is expected to be completed by the end of the year and a report should be available to me then at which stage I will consider the outcomes and proposals of the review.E</p>

            <p eId="para_1869">Working through the arts helps to nurture and develop cognitive, communicative, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social, and spiritual intelligence and skills.  Arts education in primary schools, through drama and also the subjects of music, visual arts and through language, provides opportunities for a child to express ideas, feelings and imaginative insights, to make sense of and express his/her world in visual tangible form; and to make, listen and respond to art.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">At post-primary level, drama is one of the dimensions of language subjects along with literature, poetry and film, which provide an important vehicle for self expression and creativity, and a way of bringing to the fore themes of everyday life which warrant exploration and group discussion as part of the learning process.  This education also builds foundation skills in a key vocational/business sector of the economy.  The artists in schools guidelines, developed jointly by the Arts Council and my Department, provide practical help for primary and post primary schools on how to plan and implement "arts in education" practice.  This is where practising artists give of their time and expertise to work closely with schools, and students get the opportunity to get real experience of the arts in action in communities, both as visitors and participants.</p>

            <p eId="para_1872">The Deputy is referring to a private ABA centre in Dublin 13.  I can confirm that my Department has received a proposal for funding from the organisation that runs the centre in question. My Department will respond to the submitted proposal in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1873">Consideration of this proposal will take account of my Department's policy in this regard, which is focused on ensuring that all children, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network.  This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1874">My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports.  In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1875">Reflective of the important role of continuing professional development, my Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) through the Special Education Support Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">The Deputy will be familiar with the ABA pilot scheme which was funded by my Department for the past decade.  All of the centres which participated in this scheme have been granted recognition as special schools for children with autism.  These schools will operate in line with my Department's policy.  I am pleased to update the Deputy that following their recognition the new schools are currently progressing well in the transitional phase.  Twelve schools have opened and the remaining school is scheduled to open shortly. It is my intention to continue to support this transitional process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1877">The pilot scheme was established in the absence of a network of school-based special classes for children with autism which is now available.  The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of this network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years.  In excess of 430 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1879">I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding for an extension.  The application was assessed and assigned a band rating of 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_1880">The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.  This project will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">In the meantime, for works that are of a very urgent nature, it is open to the school authorities to consider if the works in question qualify for funding under the Department's Emergency Works Scheme.  An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and, in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  Details of the scheme, together with an application form for grant assistance, can be accessed on the Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>

            <p eId="para_1883">I wish to advise the Deputy that the decision to withdraw Resource Teacher for Travellers was taken by the previous Government as part of the last budget.  The requirement to make expenditure savings and to ensure that staffing numbers remain within the Public Service Employment Control Framework prevent me from re-visiting this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1884">Resource Teacher for Traveller posts/Teaching Hours for Traveller pupils will be withdrawn, effective from 31 August 2011.  Traveller pupils who are eligible for learning support teaching should receive this tuition through the existing learning support provision in schools.  All schools should select students for learning support on the basis of priority of need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1885">Limited alleviation or adjustment measures are being provided to assist schools that have high concentrations of Traveller pupils who were previously supported by Resource Teachers for Travellers.  The expected budgetary target reduction in the number of Resource Teacher for Traveller Posts/Teaching Hours for Travellers, based on estimated provision for 2011, was 723 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) posts.  As at the end of January 2011, in respect of the 2010/2011 school year, the actual number of Resource Teachers for Travellers employed amounted to a total of 709.54 WTE posts nationwide.  The number of Whole Time Equivalent post savings in respect of the withdrawal of RTT posts will therefore be 709.54 posts.  This will be offset by any alleviation or adjustment posts which are allocated.  A total of 119 such posts have been allocated to date.  The Department does not record details of schools by constituency categorisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1886">There have been a number of reports on Traveller Education, including the one referred to by the Deputy.  In November 2006 the advisory committee on Traveller education published its Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy.  The strategy covers, in a very comprehensive manner, aspects of Traveller Education from pre-school right through to further and higher education within a lifelong learning context.  The underlying principle recommended for provision of additional resources is that the "principle of individual educational need" rather than "Traveller identity" is the criteria for all children, including Traveller children.</p>

The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18 March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.

            <p eId="para_1899">From September 2010, the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government removed eligibility for all new applicants in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, for student maintenance grants. The cost of the student services charge and tuition fees payable to colleges continues to be met for eligible students by the Exchequer on their behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_1900">I understand that the reason it was decided to discontinue the practice of allowing students to hold both an allowance and a grant simultaneously was because this represented a duplication of income support payments. I regret that the economic circumstances of the country are such that I am not in a position to reverse this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1901">The Deputy may be aware that students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the relevant grant schemes. Students who progressed to a new course with effect from 2010/11 are no longer eligible for student maintenance grants but can continue to apply for assistance towards the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable.   To assist students in exceptional financial need, the Student Assistance Fund at some €5m continues to be made available through the access offices of third-level institutions. The access offices themselves will also provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1910">I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 98, 99, 101 and 108 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1911">The Deputy will be aware that it is necessary to ensure that educational services are delivered within the resources available due to the current fiscal position. I intend to prioritise and support special educational services. However, I cannot re-visit the previous Government's decision to place a cap on the number of posts available under the Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme. This number is 10,575 whole time equivalent (WTE) posts. This is a significant number of posts and unlike other areas of the public sector vacancies are being filled up to this number. It also represents continual increases in the number of SNAs over recent years.   It is considered that with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources that there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend either a mainstream or special school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1912">The NCSE has issued a circular to all schools advising of the allocation process for the 2011/2012 school year. A key feature of the amended scheme will be to provide for an annual allocation of Special Needs Assistant support to eligible schools. The NCSE asked schools to submit all applications for SNA support to them by 18th March, 2011 and intend to inform schools of their annual SNA allocation as soon as possible, in advance of the coming school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1913">In respect of the allocation of Resource Teaching hours/posts, the total number of Whole time Equivalent (WTE) posts that are being provided for mainstream educational resource teaching/learning support (including under the General Allocation Model) for 2011 is approximately 9,950 WTE posts. By comparison approximately 9,600 WTE posts were provided for 2010. The Deputy will note that this is an increase in the number of WTE posts available for the previous year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1914">Circular 37/2011 provides information to schools regarding the arrangements which are being put in place for the 2011/12 school year for the allocation of Resource Teaching hours for children with assessed special educational needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1918">The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment in the context of the forthcoming National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. The focus of the review will be on how best to enhance children's learning in these areas, provide a clearer delineation of the learning outcomes required, and integrate into the infant cycle the learning experiences from Aistear, the curriculum framework for early childhood education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">In junior cycle, the NCCA will shortly advise me on reforms designed to address curriculum overload and rote learning, and promote creativity and innovation.  It is possible that the reforms may provide further scope in the longer term for continued reform in senior cycle, such as the expansion of second assessment components in the examinations to strengthen practical project and portfolio based learning.  I have also asked the higher education institutions to examine the scope for reform of the CAO points system to address the negative effects on students' learning in senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">Reform in mathematics is already under way in junior and senior cycle under the Project Maths initiative which began in all schools in September 2010 building on the experience of 24 schools which began the initiative in 2008. Project Maths is being phased in over a three-year period across 5 strands of mathematics.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">A revised syllabus in Leaving Certificate Irish began in September 2010 for first examination in 2012.  40% of the marks in the examination will be available for oral assessment.  The NCCA has been asked to review the syllabus in the light of students' experience in the first examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">In science, revised curricula were introduced in 2003 at primary and junior cycle levels. The NCCA is currently engaging in a public consultation process on revised draft syllabuses in Leaving Certificate Biology, Physics and Chemistry prior to submitting its advice to me. A key objective is to strengthen practical investigative and scientific process skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">The priorities in the period ahead are to strengthen achievement in literacy and numeracy, to implement reforms in maths, Irish and science, and to progress junior cycle reforms.  Changes will be supported by appropriate lead in notice and professional development for teachers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1926">The Programme for Government undertakes the prioritisation of school building projects in a revised national development plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">I have already declared my intention to initiate the preparation of a five-year plan for educational infrastructure at primary and post-primary level having regard to demographic trends and the need to upgrade existing stock.  Improved forecasting of demand for new school places through my Departments GIS system and more comprehensive information on existing school accommodation through improvements to the inventory on school accommodation will facilitate the development of this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1928">My Department has in place a number of approaches to delivering major projects under the school building programme.  These include the traditional design process which has recently been enhanced through the introduction of a preliminary design meeting between the design team, the school authority and my Department to ensure a focused and targeted approach to the early stages of the design process.  On a number of new projects where design teams were appointed this year, this approach has already shown indications that it can accelerate the early stages of the design process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1929">A Rapid "design and build" process which streamlines and speeds up the traditional processes in order to minimise the timeframe in getting a project on-site is also used where the new accommodation is urgently needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1930">More recently, a pilot initiative has commenced under which projects are devolved to a VEC or Local Authority for delivery. A key aim of this initiative is to determine the scope for greater levels of co-operation between the Department and the VEC and local government sectors in developing school infrastructure, with a view to increasing the output of school building projects.  I have also requested that my Department's Planning and Building Unit develop generic designs at post-primary level to enhance the speedy delivery of new post-primary schools. This approach will shortly be complimented by the development of a number of exemplar designs as part of the appointment of design teams on a number of new post-primary projects.  Each of these approaches will have  a role to play in delivering the required projects under the programme.</p>

It will be necessary to consider the report's recommendations and proposals. In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.

            <p eId="para_1973">Section 23(1)(<i>e</i>) of the 1990 Act excludes, inter alia, “an officer of a vocational education committee” from this definition of “worker”. Arising from an agreement between management and union sides to abolish the existing Conciliation and Arbitration machinery for vocational educational committee officers and to bring them within the scope of the Industrial Relations Acts, it is proposed to amend the definition of “worker” to include such officers, with the exception of teachers, within the definition of “worker” in the Act.  An amendment to this effect was included in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2009, which had not completed its progress through the Dáil before the House was dissolved on 1 February 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">The question of an amendment to the Industrial Relations Acts to provide for the inclusion of persons employed in the Civil Service in the definition of "worker" may arise in future in the context of possible changes in arrangements under the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.

            <p eId="para_2063">I do not have a policy function in relation to the provision of a service for reporting missing children.  The allocation of specific numbers in the 116 number range, which are reserved for services of social value, is managed in Ireland by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_2064">The role of ComReg is limited to the assignment of the number to an appropriate service provider.  Once the number has been assigned, it is a matter for the service provider to provide the service.  Neither ComReg nor my Department has any function in providing such services or the remit to require any organisation to provide the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2065">While the number 116000 has been specifically reserved for a hotline for missing children, it will not become operational until it is assigned to an appropriate service provider.  ComReg has published an information notice on its website which makes all relevant information available to potential applicants who may wish to provide the 116000 service.  It also issued corresponding national press advertisements inviting applications for the number in question.  Unfortunately, to date, no applications have been received in respect of the 116000 service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">The Departments of Justice and Equality and Department of Health and Children, have policy functions in the area of missing children and child protection respectively and the question of providing a missing children's hotline has been raised with them.  I have written to both Ministers recently and officials from my Department are continuing to engage with those Departments on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_2071">Saorview is the new digital free-to-air service which RTÉ launched on 26 May 2011.  The launch of Saorview forms an integral part of Ireland's national digital switchover strategy which provides for the closure of the RTÉNL analogue TV network at the end of 2012 and, through the resulting ‘digital dividend', paves the way for the delivery of new jobs, new mobile and broadband services and new national economic growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_2072">I am keenly aware of the challenges this initiative brings, in particular for Irish households which are reliant on the analogue network.  Each of these households will need to upgrade to digital TV by the end of 2012 or they will lose access to television.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">Experience from other European countries indicates that the cost of set top boxes, for example, reduces as the date for digital switchover approaches, and there is increased competition in the market.  I look forward to RTÉ and RTÉNL working intensively with manufacturers and retailers to ensure that there is a plentiful supply of simple to use, accessible and affordable set top boxes available on the market as well as a wide range of digital televisions and digital video recorders.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">To overcome the challenges that digital switchover brings, we must also assist people with information and practical assistance to ensure that no one is left behind as Ireland goes digital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">For my part, as Minister, I have promised to deliver a substantial information campaign providing households with information on the digital switchover and on their options for going digital.  This information campaign will start in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">In conjunction with this, my Department is currently developing plans to ensure that a range of practical assistance is made available, in particular, to address the particular needs of vulnerable households as they prepare to go digital.  In this context, the expertise and local knowledge of the many voluntary and charity organisations around the country will be of critical importance to ensuring the success of the switchover process.  I have asked my Department to ensure that, to the greatest possible extent, these organisations play a major part in our information campaign.</p>
            <p eId="para_2077">I have no plans, however, to introduce waivers for persons on social welfare payments to upgrade their television equipment.</p>

            <p eId="para_2080">With some exemptions, the charge applies to a residential property that is not the sole or main residence of the owner.  A residential property, in the Act, means a building used, or suitable for use, as a dwelling and the definition of a dwelling includes that it must be a ‘separate' dwelling.  This suggests that dwellings under the Act must have their own independent access and facilities — as is the case for apartments and flats.</p>

The review's recommendations were dealt with conclusively by the further strengthening of national leadership through the establishment of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">Although structured around the principal local authorities, for operational purposes there is a sharing of services among a number of fire authorities, such as in Dublin, Galway, Louth and Westmeath.  The fire services have been to the fore also in using the "shared services" concept, and have provided training and mobilisation and communications facilities on a regional basis for some years now.  I have recently approved a new programme of joint procurement of fire appliances which further extends this concept, and is expected to deliver budgetary and administrative savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2111">The national blueprint and programme for developing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Fire Services is set out in the recently agreed Irish Fire Services National Development Framework 2010-2015.  The Framework sets out policies and key actions in the areas of Fire Services Role in Society; National Processes and Standards; Staff Learning and Development; Quality Assurance Systems and Reporting Performance; and Service Infrastructure and Legislative Support. The Framework was prepared by my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, which is also managing the implementation of its actions through close working with its Management Board and Consultative Committee, which ensures that all key stakeholders, including staff representatives, are involved.  I will forward a copy of the Framework to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2112">At the most recent count, there are 271 officers (including the 29 Chief Fire Officers) and 3,416 fire fighters countrywide, who provide and manage the delivery of fire services from 220 fire stations, using a fleet of some 500 vehicles. The annual budget provided by local authorities (and managed by the Chief Fire Officers) for running fire services is of the order of €240m.  It should be noted that requests for staffing in the fire services have been approved within the Employment Control Framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_2113">In undertaking any international comparison, it is vital to look at the duties and functions carried out by the Fire Service in Ireland. This is a broad range and encompasses fire prevention work, including community fire safety; running the Building Control and dangerous buildings service; leading major emergency management within the local government system and in the inter-agency regional structures; running mobilisation and communication centres as well as training centres on a regional basis; liaising with and in some cases running the Civil Defence service; and making input to national policy development and delivery. All these areas of work are managed by the 29 Chief Fire Officers (at a ratio of one Chief per eight senior fire officers).</p>
            <p eId="para_2114">This expanded range of functions may be in contrast with other jurisdictions to which the question refers.  In Northern Ireland, Fire and Rescue Services are not provided by local authorities, but operate as a single regional authority, headed by a Chief Fire Officer who is supported by two Assistant Chief Fire Officers.  It also has an officer cadre, appropriate to the needs of the organisation, and a different structure to that in this jurisdiction, with Directors, Managers, Group Commanders, Assistant Group Commanders and so on, as well as a significant headquarters staffing complement.  At the other end of the scale, in Denmark, which has a population similar to Ireland, I understand there are some 98 Chief Fire Officers in the local government system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">I consider that the Irish Fire Service is appropriately structured and I appreciate the high quality of services provided and managed by our senior fire officers.  In accordance with the Irish Fire Services National Development Framework, there will continue to be a significant continuing agenda of development work which senior fire personnel will lead.</p>

            <p eId="para_2121">In line with overall national policy which promotes a reduction in energy use, the enhancement of energy efficiency standards remains a priority within my Department's overall strategy for the improvement of local authority housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">Under my Department's Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock. The programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building and the installation of high-efficiency condensing boilers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2123">Some €31million is being provided to local authorities in 2011 in respect of their social housing improvement works programmes. Under this year's programme, there is a particular focus on returning vacant properties to productive use.  Newer houses constructed in accordance with Part L of the Building Regulations should achieve a high level of energy efficiency and will not require any form of retrofitting. While the installation of solid fuel stoves as room heaters is supported under the retrofitting programme when used to replace an open fire, it is not possible from an energy efficiency or a value for money perspective to justify the replacement of a highly efficient heating system with a less efficient solid fuel one. Therefore, any such works undertaken by a local authority in this regard are not eligible for funding under my Department's current programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2124">My Department is also working closely with other Departments and agencies to develop a whole of Government approach to addressing the issue of energy affordability. An inter-departmental group is currently finalising a comprehensive energy affordability strategy which will be presented to my colleague the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_2143">As the Deputy will be aware, the ‘New Immigration Regime for Full Time non-EEA Students' was published on 22 September 2010.  The Report contains more than 20 recommendations designed to reform the student immigration regime in a manner that is better integrated with Ireland's immigration policy generally while providing a stronger regulatory framework for the sustainable development of the international education sector.  A number of the recommendations contained in the Report came into effect from 1 January 2011.  These recommendations include the introduction of maximum periods of residence in the State on foot of a student permission and the introduction of a differentiated approach as between "Degree Programme" courses and those at the "Language or Non-Degree Programme" level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">In order to ensure a smooth transition from the old regime to the new a special dedicated e-mail address —<i>studentreviewgroup@justice.ie</i> —  has been put in place within the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  This facility allows students to send in details of their case for consideration, in the context of the new regime.  To date this service has dealt with approximately 1,500 queries from students and education providers regarding the operation of the new regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_2145">In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy, it is not possible to give a definitive answer because each student's options can depend on their immigration history (for instance the number of years they have been in Ireland and the courses they have pursued).  It will also be necessary for my officials to look in more detail at the course referred to.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">Therefore I would advise the Deputy that, in this case, the students should write to <i>studentreviewgroup@justice.ie</i> setting out the full details of their particular case.  The students can expect a full and prompt response to their queries.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_720">
            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_2174">Applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT) which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice and Equality on whether such status should be granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2175">During 2010, the median processing time for asylum applications by the ORAC was 6 to 7 weeks from the date of application in the case of prioritised applications, and 9 weeks from the date of application in the case of non-prioritised applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_2176">The median processing times for RAT appeals in 2010 was 33 weeks in the case of substantive appeals (cases involving an oral hearing) and 9 weeks in the case of accelerated appeals (appeals on the papers).</p>
            <p eId="para_2177">I would point out that some cases can take significantly longer to complete due to, for example, delays arising from medical issues, non-availability of interpreters or because of judicial review proceedings.  All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">For the sake of completeness, I should also state that persons who are refused a declaration under Section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) enter what is commonly referred to as the "leave to remain" process which generally has two elements to it; an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended).  This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive given that where an application for subsidiary protection is lodged in addition to representations for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the subsidiary protection application must be considered first to assess whether the applicant has an identifiable need for international protection.  The investigation of such applications requires a fresh examination of the entire asylum file, the documentation and country of origin information submitted in support of the application, as well as an examination of objective, reputable, up to date country of origin information before a conclusion can be arrived at as to whether or not the applicant is likely to be exposed to ‘serious harm' if returned to his/her country of origin.  Where such an application is refused, consideration must then be given to the case in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), at which point the Minister must make a decision whether or not to make a deportation order in respect of the person.  All of this must be done in strict compliance with the Constitution, together with relevant international law including the European Convention on Human Rights.  It will be seen that these are not quick or easy decisions to make and, given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">I have taken steps to speed up the processing of these applications by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies primarily.</p>
            <p eId="para_2181">The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements.  This re-organisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion.  The Deputy is probably aware that I am currently developing a number of amendments to the Bill before commencing Committee Stage which I hope to be in a position to do in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2184">Recognition of divorces in Ireland that fall outside the scope of the Brussels II <i>bis</i>  Regulation is subject to the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986.

These include the attendance of veterinary surgeons at racing and at sales trials, employment of personnel to oversee greyhound welfare and the employment of a Welfare Manager.  Bord na gCon is also an active member of the International Greyhound Forum — an international group involved in the establishment of welfare standards and education.  A guide to best practice as to the care and welfare of greyhounds is available from the Bord na gCon website.</p>

          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_733">
            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_2228">I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 to 181, inclusive, 191, 193 and 198 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">Firstly I wish to offer my sincere condolences to the relatives of the person who has died.  From what I have been informed, I understand that the man concerned had collapsed in the street and passers-by came to his help and called for an ambulance.  It appears that it was subsequently decided at the scene, because of the man's condition, to take him direct to hospital by private vehicle and the ambulance was cancelled.  The HSE's log of calls to the National Ambulance Service does bear out this version of events as the ambulance was cancelled nine minutes after the first 999 call had been received.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">I commend the instincts that prompted people on the street to help a fellow human being in a dire situation.  No one can predict the outcome when faced with such a dilemma.  The emergency services can provide advice and support over the phone while an ambulance is awaited but the confusion on the ground may have made this difficult in this case.  This case underlines the need for the reform and modernisation of the ambulance service currently underway.  While it does not appear to have been an issue in this case, the move to two national call centres to prioritise and manage calls is clearly essential.  It is critical that emergency ambulances are used for emergency services and that there is a rapid hand-over of patients at emergency departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2231">Supported by my Department and by HIQA, the NAS is working to improve the management and integration of its services.  This includes a reduction to two ambulance control centres nationally, with appropriate technology, a clinical lead for pre-hospital care, development and implementation of new performance indicators for pre-hospital care and development of standard national criteria in relation to non-emergency patient transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2232">The HIQA report "Pre-Hospital Emergency Care: Key Performance Indicators for Emergency Response Times", published in January 2011, recommends response times for first responders and for ambulances.  The HIQA response time standard for transporting ambulances is 18 minutes 59 seconds for life threatening emergencies in 75% of cases.  The HSE has been recording this data since January 2011 and since March 2011 has advised me that it meets this standard throughout Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">The table details the level of ambulance cover in the Louth and Meath region.  I have been advised by the HSE that the level of service on 26 May 2011 was the same as the service provided prior to July 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2253">Following the transfer of emergency complex care to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, ambulance activity, including emergency, urgent and routine, has increased by over 600 calls in a full year.  In response to this, the HSE has placed additional resources on an interim basis, which are currently under review to determine which configuration will deliver the best service.  The NAS deploys resources on a dynamic basis, to meet surges in demand and ensure spatial application of emergency cover.  Resources in any given area can be supplemented by re-deploying available capacity from surrounding areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2254">In relation to the incident on 26 May, the HSE has carried out an investigation and has advised me as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2255">A 999 call was received from the Drogheda area at the National Ambulance (NAS) Service Command and Control Centre at 09:59 on 26 May 2011.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2256">A number of emergency vehicles were already engaged on other 999 calls at the time.  Vehicles parked at the local emergency department were awaiting the handing over of patients and were not free.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2257">At 10:00, the nearest available emergency vehicle was dispatched to the scene.  The ambulance had already been dispatched from Navan to provide cover in Drogheda and was not in Navan at the time of the call.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2258">At 10.08 (9 minutes after receipt of the 999 call), a second 999 call was received from the scene, cancelling the ambulance as the patient was being transported by a private vehicle.   In line with best practice the issue has also been referred by the HSE to its Serious Incident Team for assessment.  The Health and Information and Quality Authority has sought a detailed briefing on the incident.</p>
            <p eId="para_2259">The National Ambulance Service has undergone significant change in order to ensure quality, safety and value for money. In line with other clinical areas, this process is ongoing as clinical needs and standards develop. I believe that these developments are in the best interests of patients, and that they are a key part of the Government's work to ensure high quality emergency care.</p>

            <p eId="para_2261">I am committed to ensuring that acute hospital services at national, regional and local level are provided in a clinically appropriate and efficient manner. In particular I want to ensure that services are provided safely and in the setting most appropriate to patients' needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2262">The local emergency department in Louth County Hospital was put in place last year following the transfer of emergency and complex care to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda and is a 7 day service available between 9am and 8pm each day.  The unit treats adults and children aged fourteen years and over who present with non-emergency conditions. Attendances to the service have continued to increase in 2011 with an average of 25 daily. Patients requiring emergency hospital admission are admitted to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda or the nearest appropriate hospital.

         the reason a social worker who lives on the Border must pay an annual fee to the National Social Work Qualification Board together with an annual fee to CORU before they can practice on both sides of the Border; and if social work qualifications should be recognised on both sides of the Border to avoid this duplication.

          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_741">
            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_2277">CORU is the umbrella body responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals. It includes the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the 12 registration boards to be established under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. The Health and Social Care Professionals Council  was established in March 2007 and has been working to put in place the necessary structures for registration, education and fitness to practise for the twelve health and social care professions designated in the Act. The first registration board under the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010, and the opening of the Social Workers Register on 31st May 2011 to accept registrants marks the start of statutory registration of this profession.  CORU will enable health and social care professionals to practice in a regulated manner while providing the highest level of patient care and service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2278">I presume the Deputy refers in his question to the situation where social workers are required to register in Northern Ireland with the Northern Ireland Social Care Council and in the South with CORU. The National Social Work Qualifications Board was dissolved in March 2011 and its functions in relation to "non-national qualifications" were assumed by the Social Workers Registration Board of CORU. The competent authority for the assessment of social work qualifications in Ireland is the Social Workers Registration Board and, in Northern Ireland, the competent authority is the Northern Ireland Social Care Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_2279">There is no mutual recognition agreement in place between the two jurisdictions in relation to social work. Instead, the provisions of Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications affords the opportunity to interested persons to have their qualifications recognised to work in both jurisdictions. This Directive applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EU Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications, on either a self-employed or employed basis. Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than their own, but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualification for public health and safety and consumer protection. The Directive also contains provisions in relation to the provision of  temporary services where a service provider, established in one member state, wishes to provide services in another member state on a temporary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2280">For the purposes of the Directive, a regulated profession is defined as a professional activity, access to which is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specific professional qualifications i .e.  where statutory registration exists. Hence a statutory registration fee is payable in the two jurisdictions should a person wish to practise their profession in the two jurisdictions.</p>

At the same time, the number of appeals of a decision regarding a medical card in the Dublin/Mid-Leinster area increased significantly.  At the end of May 2011, there were 456 appeals on hand in that area.  Where a person submits an appeal within 21 days of a decision, they retain their medical or GP visit card until the appeal is decided.  The processing of some appeals was delayed while the necessary documentation was being collated by the Local Health Office.  In view of this, it was decided that, where outstanding appeals had been received prior to 1 January 2011, the appellants would be permitted to retain their medical card for an additional 3 months to enable them to submit a new application to take account of any change in their circumstances.  Appellants were advised of this decision and were also informed that, should they be refused a medical card, they could submit a new appeal.</p>

The Programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city. The facilities funded range from new equipment for the smallest clubs, to regional multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence. Over 7,400 projects providing a range of essential sports facilities have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998 bringing the total allocation in that time to over €739 million. These grants continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring the provision of modern, high quality facilities around Ireland that attract more people to participate in sporting activities. No decision has yet been made about the timing of further rounds of the programme.</p>

I have therefore referred the Deputy's question, insofar as the GDA is concerned, to the NTA for direct reply.

            <p eId="para_2335">My Department has no scheme in place to fund privately developed and operated park &amp; ride facilities. However, funding is provided to relevant local authorities in an ongoing programme of Bus Priority Measures (Green Routes) and Park &amp; Ride facilities in the four regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. Since 2006 the four cities have received funding totalling €55 million, of which approximately €2 million was in respect of park &amp; ride facilities. In line with the general reduction in capital funding, the outgoing government cut the overall budget for the regional bus priority/park &amp; ride programme from €14m in 2010 to €5.5m in 2011. Given the limited availability of funding for this and other capital programmes, I consider the further roll-out of bus priority improvements in each city should be afforded a higher degree of priority than the development of park &amp; ride facilities. Indeed in certain cases the development of park &amp; ride facilities would be premature pending further improvement in bus priority measures.</p>
