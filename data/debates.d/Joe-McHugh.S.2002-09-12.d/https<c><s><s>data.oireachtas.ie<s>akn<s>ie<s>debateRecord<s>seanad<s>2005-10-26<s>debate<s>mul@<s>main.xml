I raised the matter in the House last week with the Deputy Leader and I ask the Leader when we will have a full debate on this issue. While this is a shocking report, we must respond cooly. We must set out an agenda of work to implement vital legislation required to protect children and find out if the Government's promised inquiry into clerical sex abuse in the Dublin area will be extended nationwide.</p>

That exemplary action should be supported through swift legislative responses. There are issues for the Catholic Church, but the most vital issue is that Canon Law cannot supersede the law of the Oireachtas, that there is no position of privilege for any group of church men or women over citizens of this country and that those in positions of trust must show, through that trust, the extent to which their organisations can change.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_10">A protocol to deal with this issue does not exist in every diocese of this country. That is a matter of immediate concern to the Catholic Church. I know Bishop Eamonn Walsh. He is a person of considerable integrity. He has two great skills that the Catholic Church has lacked in recent years — genuine humility and judgment coupled with a razor sharp intellect. I congratulate him on his work over the past two years dealing with this appalling issue in the Ferns diocese.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Together we can move forward, if legislation is forthcoming and if there is a response from all the agencies, to deal with this issue in a comprehensive manner.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_12">I know a priest who was editor of a clerical magazine and who was sacked by the hierarchy because, in 1989, he wanted the magazine to introduce a debate on clerical child abuse. For his sins he was cast to the furthest part of west Mayo where he is still a curate. I recall being in the office of the then Minister for Education and the current Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, and battling against the pervasive influence of the Knights of St. Columbanus in attempting to secure the introduction of the Stay Safe programme in Irish primary schools. To give credit to the Leader, without her support at that time as Minister, the Stay Safe programme, which gives children the words and encouragement to talk about what happens to them, would not have been introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Following each of the horrible cases in Kilkenny and Mayo, I and my Independent colleagues proposed motions in the House urging the House and the Government to support the concept of mandatory reporting. Our proposals were refused and such reporting has not been introduced. In the 1960s and 1970s the current Pope, as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, issued an edict of <i>omerta</i> to the Catholic Church authorities in every diocese in Europe advising them how to deal with cases of clerical abuse. They were bound to silence. Such matters would be dealt with through Canon Law. If they broke the silence on the information they received, and it was not received in the confessional, they would be automatically excommunicated. Even victims who broke that silence were threatened with excommunication. What influence or impact did that have in every diocese in this country? This must be examined. It is outrageous that it must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I am grateful Senator Brian Hayes considered this report in detail. I could not do it. I found it nauseating and sickening. I could not cope with one story, in particular. A young child, in the course of preparing for confirmation, was abused by a priest in the confession box. She told her parents and her parents acted immediately by going to the gardaí and the bishop. The matter was investigated. The parents pleaded with the bishop not to allow that priest anywhere near the confirmation ceremony but on the day, the priest swaggered into the church with the bishop by his side. That was appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Two years later that child unfortunately died suddenly. The parents made one request, that the child abuser not officiate at the funeral ceremony. However, he insisted on doing it. Those parents, believing in their faith, had to sit in their church and watch the man who abused their child say prayers over her body before she was consigned to the grave. If it had been my child, I believe I would now be serving time.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Part of me believes that the sooner we discuss this, the better but, on the other hand, perhaps we should wait a little because it is too raw at this stage. We need to know how we should proceed with issues such as Stay Safe programmes, mandatory reporting, the impact of the Catholic Church and the impact of groups such as the Knights of St. Columbanus. That group, apparently, had some impact on why the case I mentioned and eight similar ones that occurred on the altar of that church were not investigated. It is appalling.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_17">In the late 1980s and a number of times since then, I quoted in this House what I heard a senior Garda officer in Cork say about child abuse. He said that the Garda Síochána knows that the vast majority of abuse is perpetrated by homosexuals. He was not speaking in a private capacity. He also said that "we had to be careful because a huge part of the campaign was being run by people who are setting out to undermine the sanctity of the family in Ireland". It is not my style to mention names in the House. On each occasion I assumed that somebody would ask me who the person was and that an investigation would take place. I was never asked who said it. We had a culture of silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">A series of questions must be asked. Did a private institution attempt to subvert the law of the land by swearing its members to silence? If it did, it is a criminal offence, a breach of the rights of citizens and an interference with the sovereignty of the State. If people did this, they should be held to account. Is such an institution fit to be the manager of most of our schools? This is a valid question in light of its apparently unclear allegiance to the law of the land when the interests of the institution are apparently threatened. I ask these questions as a practising Catholic having to live battered and bruised with what was much worse than incompetence.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">Are the current procedures for dealing with matters in schools acceptable? Why is it taking so long to initiate an inquiry in Dublin? Will the Church open its archives for the past 100 years so we can find out whether child abuse is something new or if it existed for 100 years but, because of the way the world was organised, was ignored? Like Senator O'Toole, I am not sure whether we should discuss this matter now or stay calm about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">I wish to mention two other matters. When the priest Senator O'Toole mentioned was banished, I took up the issue in correspondence columns and received a metaphorical belt of the crozier from one of the two bishops named in the report. I was told that I was exaggerating and making things up and that I should stick to my lay activities and leave these matters to my betters. Second, there are dioceses in this country where the Stay Safe programme was not permitted. One of them is not far from where I live. Any bishop who bans the Stay Safe programme has a serious question to answer about his fitness to be in that position or to be in a position of leadership in society.</p>

          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_21">It is difficult to speak today about anything other than the Ferns report but there are people better able than I to speak on it. Last evening, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power, spoke on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children about the implementation of the regional health fora and plans to establish them.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Members will recall the debates in this House in 2004 on the legislation establishing the Health Service Executive. They will also recall the promises that there would be continued local involvement in the health service. We approved legislation that disbanded, at a sweep, all local accountability for the health services and Members on both sides of the House accepted the assurance that the health fora would be established. However, the Minister of State informed Senator Bannon on the Adjournment debate last night that there must be consultation with, among others, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and that he did not know when the fora would be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">That is not good enough. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this issue. In Galway city on Monday night, people were arriving at the accident and emergency department every three and a half minutes. There were 20 people in the department overnight. We should not have to discuss this in the Seanad. It should be discussed locally but there is no forum in which to do so. We gave away that right. The Minister for Health and Children should come to the House and explain why she has not implemented what was promised in 2004 and why there is no local accountability in the regions for health services.</p>

          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_24">I support Senator Cox. The much vaunted Health Service Executive has caused great frustration among public representatives because it is very difficult to get information from within the system, which was previously possible with the health boards. I agree with the Senator's comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Previous speakers have spoken about a grave matter and I am reluctant to change the subject. However, I wish to raise the matter of turf-cutting because a crazy situation has arisen. Turf-cutting has been a traditional right of people in this country but the latest edict from the EU, that in future turf-cutters must apply for planning permission and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will require an environmental impact assessment from the turf-cutter is crazy. If such restrictions are imposed it will be another example of how this has become an over regulated country. Rather than ask that Minister to come into the House, would the Leader find out from him if this is true and if so, would she point it to him that it is a crazy scenario?</p>

        <speech by="#DrMauriceHayes" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_26">I, too, spent last night reading the Ferns report. I did not sleep and I think I will sleep less tonight. It reminds me of a task I had years ago, reading the evidence of the Kincora inquiry which contained similar matters. I thank God for people like Bishop Walsh, Mr. Colm O'Gorman and those who had the courage to come forward and deal with this. It would be worthwhile looking at the experience in the North because we have been through this mill with many cases. In particular, the police there have developed good techniques, with women police, for dealing with children who have been abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">This is a sorry tale of abuse going on over years and of failure of governance. While we should debate it, one of the elements I would council against is a knee-jerk reaction to rush into legislation. When there is an outrage of some kind there is a demand for emergency legislation. There is a reaction in one's imagination similar to that following the tragedy on 11 September 2001, but almost always one finds in retrospect that the subsequent legislation has been ill-conceived, cobbled together and has not met the need. We want to get this right.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_29">Another aspect, if I could be forgiven for saying so, is that over the years there were decent journalists — and newspapers — who tried to get some of these bishops to face their responsibility and each time were told they had reached a new low.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_30">It seems there is only one issue before the House today, the tragic impact of the Ferns report. I hope that the decent faithful, as they call them in Ireland, will be able to separate the issues of their own faith from the scandalous behaviour of some of the officers of their church. I also hope that the decent priests, of whom there are many, do not get caught in the backlash. The people who are responsible are the ones responsible but I would say, echoing what many of my colleagues have said, that this goes right to the top, and I am talking about Rome. I remember when Cardinal Groer was suspended for the myriad allegations that he molested seminarians, the late Pope John Paul II wrote him a letter of sympathy and never uttered a word of comfort to the victims. The present Pope has used the Vatican to secrete people who are under this kind of accusation in Mexico. With this, we must look at the very top. The aspect I find shocking is that so many senior responsible, mature people put the reputation of the church above the suffering of children. That is dreadful.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I am glad that many people have made it clear, which is not being made clear in some aspects of the church, that there is a very definite distinction between paedophilia and homosexuality. It is important that distinction is made, is sustained and is not blurred, particularly because of the witch-hunts that have been instituted in America and the language of hatred produced against gay people by the Vatican.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">We now must look back at what we, as legislators, have done. I do not entirely agree with Senator Maurice Hayes because it seems to me that we must legislate. We are reproached by a situation in which health boards remained impotent and had to stand aside because they had no power to intervene. They could be made aware of a situation. We need not reflect for the next ten years or establish a commission to know that was wrong and must be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">As a resident in the diocese of Ferns, while I would have been aware of some of what went on from local reports in the newspapers over the years, nonetheless the report made for very shocking reading. As others here stated, the courage of the victims, particularly those who came forward, deserves to be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">A point made by Senator Maurice Hayes is important, that is, the inquiry acknowledges that there are now, because of the Kincora boys' home inquiry in Northern Ireland, units within the PSNI who deal effectively with such matters. Victims are slow to come forward in these situations and it is important that there be, within the apparatus of the State, facilities which will enable them to do that in order that this is never repeated. There are also recommendations on legislative changes which I hope will be fully implemented. A more reflective debate would take place if we allowed space to get over the emotional reaction engendered by the reading of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">It would be a pity if we took a broad brush approach to the issue. The majority of priests and religious within the diocese are of the utmost integrity. They give superb pastoral care to the community, particularly in times of great need. We should acknowledge that they also feel hurt and disillusioned as a result of what has gone on.</p>

I wish to single out two people in particular, Colm O'Gorman of the One in Four organisation and Bishop Eamonn Walsh, whom Mr. O'Gorman has justifiably praised for the painstaking work he has done in the diocese over the past two years. I support calls for a debate on this issue. I know the Leader will continue in the same spirit she has afforded in previous requests for debates on issues in this House. When will the report into the activities in the archdiocese of Dublin be issued? It is two years since the inquiry was announced and those years have been spent trying to establish the terms of reference. This is appalling. Victims are suffering.

I agree with the comments of Senators Norris and Walsh about all the good priests, brothers and nuns who do a tremendous job. This is an opportunity to separate the wheat from the chaff. The report brings into focus the vulnerability of children placed in the care of the people portrayed in the report. There can be no hiding place for them. They must be dealt with effectively in a manner that will demonstrate to all who might consider behaving that way that such conduct will not be tolerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">We have a serious situation with regard to the shortage of general practitioners, as Senator Henry has said previously. There is a cap on the number of Irish doctors that can be admitted to training annually, approximately 300. Significant problems arise in the community care and general practice areas with regard to the availability of doctors. I ask for debate on this issue. I know a report is imminent. The sooner it is issued and adopted by Government, the better. A serious situation exists. Some patients cannot get onto a general practitioners' panel.</p>

Many details of the report were heard in the rumour factories of the 1980s and 1990s and, therefore, some of the allegations as to what went on do not come as a surprise. It is important that we take Senator Maurice Hayes's advice and do not react with knee-jerk legislation. In future we must take a holistic approach towards all sectors working with young people, whether teachers, community or youth workers etc. We must introduce a proper vetting procedure across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">I will give one example of the confidence of the people in the clergy. The inquiries deal with a few rotten apples in the barrel of the priesthood. The people of Donegal have shown their utmost confidence in a priest, the man named as Donegal person of the year this year, Fr. Michael Sweeney. He was and is involved with young people at a sporting level. It is important we retain confidence in the clergy who voluntarily deal with young people through sport and community work. We must keep our eye on the ball in that regard. We must keep that balance when debating this issue.</p>

One of the worst aspects of the report was that some complainants thought the abuse they suffered was part of church ritual. In one case, a child who was being prepared for first holy communion, a sacrament common to all the Christian churches, thought it was part of the sacrament.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">We can do something immediately. I am delighted Senators O'Toole and Ryan complimented the Leader on her role in bringing forward the Stay Safe programme. I regularly ask the Department of Education and Science if that programme is implemented in all schools. The most recent reply indicated that it was implemented in between 70% and 80% of schools.

          <p eId="para_69">In the coming weeks we will have debate throughout the country on the new qualifying conditions for industrial grants. I understand the country will be divided in half for this. It appears that counties Carlow and Kilkenny will lose out on these grants because they will be grouped with the richer part of the country — counties Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare — to bring that group's population to half the population of the country. We will lose out even though we deserve the enhanced grants. We may end up getting just 20% of a grant or no grant at all. It is urgent the House debates this issue and that the relevant Minister comes here to debate the selection criteria for the different counties that will be given the necessary zoning to get enhanced grants for industrial activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">I agree with Senator Cox on the issue of local health forums. I am aware Senator Leyden wrote to Fine Gael councillors recently telling them these would be set up soon, but this appears not to be the case. We also need to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to ask where the local police force has gone. It is vital that both local health forums and local police boards are set up without further delay.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_71">We were all horrified by what we read in the Ferns report. We need legislation in this area, but we must be very careful not to have a knee-jerk reaction. For many years I have employed people to look after children in what we call "play houses". Before employing these people we contact the Garda to check the applicants are acceptable for such positions. I have now learned that if allegations had been made about somebody, but he or she had not been found guilty in court, the Garda could not report allegations had been made about that individual. I understand why that is so. However, I read in today's newspaper that the proposed legislation refers to somebody who is deemed to be a serious risk. There is a strong constitutional right for somebody who has never been found guilty not to be reported as somebody who could be deemed to be a serious risk. We must be very careful with regard to the required legislation. We do not want to pass legislation that does not protect children, but we must ensure the legislation is constitutional.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">Senator Cox outlined the lack of consultation regarding Health Service Executive areas. People now receive enhanced nursing home subventions. The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children should come to the House to explain a recent piece of correspondence I received which stated that from 20 November 2005, new eligible applicants will receive nursing home subventions but will not receive enhanced subventions. These people will be put on a waiting list pending the relaxation of budgetary restraints. This is a mean and sickening policy which is a further attack on elderly people in this country.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_50">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_77">I thank the House for the very reasoned and calm responses to and submissions on the Ferns inquiry report. It was essentially a mini debate and we have often treated serious matters in this fashion. Senator Brian Hayes rightly praised Mr. Justice Murphy. I read the entire report last night and, like Senator Brian Hayes, I was unable to sleep much afterwards. I wanted to read very line of the report, which is simply horrific.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">Senator Brian Hayes stated that we should respond coolly and set out legislation. He also asked when the announcement regarding the commencement of the investigation into clerical child abuse in the Archdiocese of Dublin would be made. I will contact the offices of the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, about proposed legislation and the investigation today and I hope to be able to report back to Senators by tomorrow morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">Senator Brian Hayes also asked that we congratulate Colm O'Gorman, a call with which I fully agree. Mr. O'Gorman was a calm and brave voice against a sea of people who did not wish to hear him. I also agree with Senator Brian Hayes's comment that Canon Law cannot take precedence over civil law. Refusing to bless the remarriages of divorced Catholics and refusing to allow them inside the portals of a Catholic church are two of the most cruel acts of the Catholic Church. Divorce is the law of the land. I know of a couple who lobbied hard for a church blessing in several parishes in Dublin but were refused by three parishes. These are people who go to church each Sunday. It is a terrible thing to do to anyone and represents the precedence of Canon Law over civil law because the church is refusing to recognise that divorce is legal, passed by a referendum with the legislation passed by both Houses of Oireachtas. It is disgraceful for the church to stand in the way of love by refusing to give church blessings in these circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">Senator Brian Hayes spoke of Bishop Eamonn Walsh's genuine humility and strong intellect, qualities which are difficult to find in one individual but which Bishop Walsh has in abundance. His clarity of thought and intellect and, above all, his total humility shine forth when he speaks.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">Senator O'Toole spoke about a priest, whose identity is known to me, who was transferred in the classic fashion to Mayo because of a magazine article of his that hurt the church. Senator O'Toole also spoke about the Stay Safe programme. I vividly recall a visit by a delegation from the INTO led by the Senator to the Department of Education in 1989 that concerned this programme, about which he informed me. Both Senator O'Toole and I remember the great hostility within the Department towards the implementation of the programme. The head psychologist and assistant secretary in charge of primary education argued strongly against its implementation, which they said was unnecessary. I was immediately attracted to the programme because it was easily understood by young people and used simple language while laid out in a proper academic fashion. The INTO put a considerable amount of time into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Mandatory reporting was never introduced because the clergy in every diocese were bound to secrecy. I imagine every diocese will have to set up investigations into its clergy and how it manages its business. I hope this report brings about considerable change. I respect that, as most people here have said, there are very good priests, brothers and nuns — we all know such people. The episode mentioned by Senator O'Toole concerning a priest who insisted on officiating at both the confirmation and funeral of a child he was alleged to have abused was unbelievable.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">Senator Ryan quoted from a conversation some years ago with a senior Garda officer and spoke about the possible existence of a cautionary culture of silence in the Catholic Church, which involved swearing members to silence. Thankfully, parents have taken a much greater role on boards of management of schools. Senator Ryan asked about the reason for the delay in initiating an inquiry in the Archdiocese of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">A considerable number of schools in Cork would not implement the Stay Safe programme. I remember receiving filthy letters, the majority of which were from Cork, which accused me of harming children by introducing the programme. A group from Cork parked its bus outside my house one Saturday and told all the visitors to my clinic that I was harming Irish children.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_86">They were certainly from Cork. Senator Cox voiced her concerns about health fora for local interests and representatives. We will ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children about them but I must read the speech given last night by the Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power. Senator Finucane called for local accountability regarding the health fora and also mentioned Turbary rights. It is crazy that people must obtain planning permission and an environmental impact assessment to cut turf. This country is over-regulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">Like many others, Senator Maurice Hayes read the Ferns report in its entirety and asked us to examine the situation in the North. Some female members of the PSNI developed good protocols for dealing with abuse victims, which would be very useful to look at. In response to comments made by Senator Norris, Senator Maurice Hayes did not argue that there should be no legislation; he merely argued against knee-jerk legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">Senator Norris is correct in stating that there are decent people in the Catholic Church, among whom most of us would count ourselves. He stated that many senior figures put the church before children's suffering and mentioned the fact the churches are exempt from equality legislation. Senator Feeney thanked Mr. Justice Murphy, a sentiment with which I agree. His report is very clear and makes for easy, if horrid, reading. Reports are often turgid but it is possible to follow this report consequentially.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">Senator Jim Walsh, who is a parishioner in the diocese of Ferns, praised the courage of the victims and called for an examination of how the PSNI deals with cases of alleged child abuse. It might be not be wise to have a debate now when everyone is so emotional. Cooler heads might lead to a cooler debate. Senator McCarthy spoke of his horror and indignation, praised Colm O'Gorman and Bishop Eamonn Walsh and asked when an investigation into the Archdiocese of Dublin would begin.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Senator Glynn spoke of his horror and revulsion at the findings of the Ferns report and mentioned that there are good priests, nuns and brothers but that there must be no hiding place for those who abuse children. He also spoke about the shortage of general practitioners. I understand that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, brought plans to the Cabinet to increase the intake of students in schools of medicine in the next academic and that the Cabinet has agreed to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Senator McHugh also mentioned the Ferns report and praised the Donegal man of the year, Fr. Sweeney. Senator Henry spoke about the abusers. I was terribly struck by the section of the report that stated that young girls thought what was happening to them was part of the preparations for their first holy communion. That shows how innocent their minds were. I will make inquiries to the Department of Education and Science today to ascertain the number of schools offering the Stay Safe programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Senator Browne called for a debate on the division of the country for the purposes of industrial grants. He also spoke about local health forums.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">Senator Quinn spoke about people in charge of children. He has knowledge of this area from his experience of providing "play houses" in some of his stores. He spoke about the need to be careful and to check with the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Senator Feighan asked me to invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to debate nursing home subventions and the budgetary considerations in that regard. I assure the Senator that nobody will be put out on the street from a nursing home in the depths of winter.</p>

        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_59">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_101">I welcome the opportunity to speak in the Seanad on this most important topic. I will outline the measures which are being taken by the Government and the Department of Health and Children, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive and many community and voluntary organisations, to address the issue of suicide, which is a serious problem in Irish society. Official mortality data from the Central Statistics Office indicate that there was an annual average of 494 deaths by suicide in Ireland between 2000 and 2002. The figure peaked at 519 in 2001. Such a number of deaths represents a rate of approximately 12.9 suicides per 100,000 people. Ireland ranks 17th among the 25 EU member states in terms of its overall suicide rate. The rate of youth suicide in Ireland, which is the fifth highest in the EU for those between the ages of 15 and 24, is of particular concern. The suicide rate in this country is even higher among those in their 20s and early 30s. Men under the age of 35 account for approximately 40% of all Irish suicides.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">Deliberate self-harm is a further significant public health problem. According to the National Parasuicide Registry, over 11,000 cases of deliberate self-harm, some of which result from serious suicide attempts, are presented to Irish hospitals each year for assessment and treatment. The highest deliberate self-harm rates are found among younger age groups. The rate for girls peaks between the ages of 15 and 19 and the rate for young men peaks between the ages of 20 and 24.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">The historical reluctance in Irish society to discuss the issue of suicide has thankfully changed. While it is to be welcomed that the level of discussion and openness about mental health issues, including deliberate self-harm and suicide, has increased significantly in recent years, we need to ensure that public discussion and media coverage of suicide and deliberate self-harm remains measured, well-informed and sensitive to the needs and well-being of psychologically vulnerable and distressed individuals in society. In particular, we need to continue to work as a society to create a culture and an environment in which people in psychological distress feel able to seek help from family, friends and health professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">Suicide touches the lives of many people. It is a tragedy in every case, because a life has ended and family, friends and community have been left behind. Many of us know someone who has attempted or completed suicide. Preventing suicide and reducing the rate of suicide in Ireland is an urgent public health issue that is at the heart of our efforts and policies, aimed at creating a healthy, prosperous and socially inclusive Ireland. In addressing the rate of suicide, we must continue to try to eliminate poverty, to achieve greater social justice and inclusion for vulnerable people in society, to address inequalities where they exist and to improve and expand educational opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">I recognise that many challenges lie ahead and I am aware that no easy or single interventions guarantee success in this area. International evidence shows that reducing the suicide rate and preventing suicides requires a collective and concerted effort from all groups in society. Work needs to be done by those involved in the health and social services, other professions, communities, voluntary and statutory agencies and organisations, as well as parents, friends, neighbours and individuals. A strategic framework is required to help us to identify the actions we can undertake in a co-ordinated way, by means of partnership between statutory, voluntary and community groups and individuals, supported by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Reach Out — A National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention was launched by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children on 8 September last. It builds on the work done in 1998 by the national task force on suicide and takes account of the efforts and initiatives developed by the former health boards in recent years. It was prepared by the project management unit of the Health Service Executive, in partnership with the national suicide review group, and supported by the Department of Health and Children. Since the work on the development of a national suicide prevention strategy was initiated almost two years ago, wide-ranging consultation has taken place throughout the country to draw on the experience, perspectives and ideas of the key stakeholders and interested parties. I thank those who participated in the process of consultation which, combined with continuous monitoring of evidence and best practice, allowed the project team to take an evidence-based and pragmatic approach to prioritising the actions to be undertaken by the various agencies and groups if they are to effect real change over the next five to ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">A straightforward approach is advocated in the strategy, which identifies four principal levels of action — a general population approach, a targeted approach, an approach to responding to suicide and an approach to information and research. Some 26 action areas have been identified across the four levels and specific points of action, which are to be implemented in three phases over the coming years, have been specified. The combined public health and high-risk approach to suicide prevention that is identified in the strategy is the same as that advocated by the International Association for Suicide Prevention. It is in keeping with the European action plan for mental health, which was signed and endorsed on behalf of the health ministers of the 52 member states of the European region of the World Health Organisation at the ministerial conference on mental health in Helsinki in January 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">A fundamental aim of the new strategy is to prevent suicidal behaviour, including deliberate self-harm, and to increase awareness of the importance of good mental health among the general population. Ongoing, quality multi-disciplinary research will be an essential strand of the strategy and findings will be of greatest value where they can inform and stimulate action and service development. The strategy identifies expected outcomes and sets targets which can be measured, monitored and revised. Continual quality control and ongoing modification and improvement of the strategy will be central to its implementation. At present, best international practice suggests that suicide prevention programmes should be developed on the basis of improving the mental health of the general population in combination with developing strategies for known high-risk groups. The new strategy includes specific recommendations for action in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The Health Service Executive is taking a lead role in overseeing the implementation of the strategy, in partnership with those statutory and voluntary organisations that have a key role in making the actions happen. Driving the implementation of the strategy is the recently established National Office for Suicide Prevention, which is based within the national population health directorate of the HSE. This office is headed by Mr. Geoff Day, formerly assistant chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board and chairman of the National Suicide Review Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The first task of the national office will be to work on the following five key priorities: stigma reduction and mental health promotion; the development of a national training programme; the development of an effective service response for those who have engaged in deliberate self-harm or who are acutely suicidal; the development of bereavement support services; and improving data collection, management and use in regard to suicidal behaviour and suicide prevention. In addition to these five priorities, all of which will be worked on simultaneously, the National Office for Suicide Prevention is committed to developing the potential use of information and communications technology — for example, using the Internet or SMS text messaging through mobile telephones — to reach out and provide support to young people and those feeling isolated and alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">An annual report will be produced by the National Office for Suicide Prevention detailing progress in regard to the implementation of strategy actions in the previous calendar year, beginning with a report in 2006. This will provide an important tool for monitoring progress in meeting the priority objectives of the strategy and reporting on rates of suicidal behaviour, which it is hoped will be significantly reduced over the coming year. The annual report will meet the requirement of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, which requires a report on activities in the area of suicide prevention to be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas each year. The production of this report had previously been a function of the National Suicide Review Group.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">An advisory group comprising key individuals who can offer their expertise to guide the work of the national office and the HSE will also be appointed. This advisory group will replace the current National Suicide Review Group, the contribution of which to suicide prevention has been considerable. In turn, a representative national forum will be briefed by the national office on the achievements overall in suicide prevention and, in particular, in regard to strategy implementation. This forum will also provide an opportunity for the exchange of views on developments in suicide research and prevention.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">Much consideration was given to the setting of an overall target for the reduction of our national suicide rate as an outcome measure of this strategy. At this stage, it has been decided that a specific target will not be set because the priority is to establish the accuracy of suicide mortality in Ireland whereas, due to the range and interplay of factors that influence the suicide rate, it is virtually impossible to establish a direct cause and effect relationship between prevention programmes and a change in the overall population rates. Nevertheless, there are undoubted advantages to setting targets for an overall reduction, not least the fact that it focuses the attention of those working at all levels of suicide prevention. An overall target for the reduction of suicide rates will be set by the Government, on the advice of the Minister for Health and Children, when the Minister is satisfied that suicide rates have been accurately determined.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">I am pleased to inform the House that funding of €500,000 has already been allocated to commence the implementation of the strategy for the remainder of 2005. This includes funding towards the development of a major national campaign for the promotion of positive mental health; the delivery of a second national intervention skills training of trainers programme; the creation of new, dedicated services for treating deliberate self-harm in accident and emergency departments; the further development of existing services; and the further development of bereavement support services. Additional funding will also be made available over the coming years to support the strategy and complement local and national efforts. This has been confirmed by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">In August 2003 I appointed the expert group on mental health policy to prepare a new national policy framework for the mental health services. In the course of its work, the expert group will consider the area of suicide prevention and reduction and will make recommendations on the matter, taking account of the national strategy, Reach Out. It will also set the issue of suicide prevention and reduction within the broader context of a mental health policy framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">In conclusion, I reiterate that the Government shares the public concern about the levels of suicide in our country. We all have our part to play in helping those who may experience and face adverse events in life, and emotions and feelings so strong, that they consider taking their own lives. We must aim to provide accessible, sensitive, appropriate and, where required, intensive support. The new suicide prevention strategy is practical and achievable, and based on evidence and international best practice. It is further evidence of the Government's determination to take whatever steps it can to reduce the level of suicide in our society. It will be subject to ongoing, regular evaluation to ensure the expected outcomes are achieved.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_60">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_117">I welcome the Minister of State and his official to the House. I am privileged to sit with Senator Glynn and others on the sub-committee investigating the high level of suicide in Irish society. The stories and facts the sub-committee has heard from different groups have opened my eyes to this issue, although we are only half way through our deliberations at this stage. While we have all been touched by suicide and every county has experienced a certain number of suicides per year, the stories told by those directly involved are harrowing. The establishment of the sub-committee is welcome and I look forward to its report, which will be published before Christmas and, I hope, acted upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">A presentation was made to the sub-committee yesterday. It was fascinating to hear the different reports. We were told that Dr. Schneidman in 1969 stated that for every death through suicide, six people suffer intense grief reactions. A report by Dr. Byrne in 2001 stated that a minimum — I stress the word "minimum"— of 50 people suffer from loss, grief, blame or shame as a result of a single suicide. When we think about suicide, we should not think only of the known cases but of the bigger picture, namely, those affected by the suicide, including those on the outer margins.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Irish society has come a long way. Those who committed suicide in the past were treated shockingly by the State and church. It is terrible that burial in their home graveyards was not allowed but, thankfully, this practice has stopped. We have opened up more in recent times with regard to the issue of suicide but, unfortunately, we have a long way to go. A speaker at yesterday's sub-committee meeting drew a good analogy. If a person had a problem with an eye, he or she would have no difficulty contacting an optician or doctor to get immediate help. However, if that person had a problem one inch above the eye, he or she would tend to close down and hide. That is a difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">I am impressed by the large number of voluntary groups working in the area, such as Console, Living Links, Aware and the Samaritans. However, looking from the outside in, I am aware there is a clear need to co-ordinate their services. All groups that came before the sub-committee spoke about the need for additional funding and stated they are not happy that they cannot give a full national service due to limited resources. I understand this comes under the remit of the National Office for Suicide Prevention which will examine co-ordinating services. It should be one of the key targets of the office.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">I was struck by one group explaining how it got telephone calls from individuals expressing concern about another with suicidal thoughts. Often it was the concerned individual who had suicidal thoughts. These individuals tended to speak in the third person instead of admitting openly they themselves had a problem. Thankfully, the groups were able to deal with this and prevent some suicides.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">In Europe, it is generally older people who commit suicide. Ireland is unique in that it has a large rate of suicide among young people, particularly among men. The suicide rate among men is four times that of women. However, more women attempt suicide and self-harm. In the past five years, the average rate of suicide stands at 490. It went over 500 in one year. These are the known cases of suicide which means the actual rate could be higher. Several studies have been carried out in other countries on single vehicle crashes which estimate that 10% of them could be suicides. As there is no data on this in Ireland, the Minister of State must set up an investigation into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">The 25 to 44 year age group, the youngest people in our society, has the highest suicide rate. Last year, there were 5,000 known attempted suicides. However, there are cases where attempted suicides go unreported. For example, an individual who had taken a drug overdose could have woken up the next morning, thankfully surviving it. He or she would have told no one about the attempted suicide. More research needs to be done in this area. While 409 people took their lives last year and 5,000 were involved in self-harm, we still do not have the full picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The Minister of State said that €500,000 was given to the National Office for Suicide Prevention, which seems to be a large amount. However, the national road safety campaign costs €22 million and the agency involved in advertising road safety received a budget of €6 million last year. By comparison, it is obvious the National Office for Suicide Prevention is way behind in funding. The message the sub-committee has received from every group is that proper resources need to be put in place. There are delays for treating those with psychological problems. Yesterday, the sub-committee heard of 23-month waiting times for some individuals. There is no infant psychological service and our adolescent services are far from perfect. One can see in the context of the mental health budget that no proper emphasis is being placed on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Aware estimates that only 50% of people with depression seek help. This is a worrying figure. Aware also estimates that depression and intoxicant problems present in 90% of suicides. One issue that emerged at the sub-committee hearings was that alcohol consumption and suicide rates have increased in parallel by 40% from 1993 to 2003. While this is a reflection of our growing affluence, as alcohol consumption levels increased, so too, unfortunately, have suicide levels. An alcohol addiction counsellor explained to the sub-committee the connection between binge drinking and suicide. In some cases, suicide is not attempted at the time of binge drinking but two to three days later. Alcohol is a mood-altering drug which not only physically affects one the following day with a hangover but also psychologically for two to three days afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The Government must put pressure on the advertising industry to stop glamorising drink. People must be educated on the downsides of alcohol consumption as it is causing havoc in people's lives. I am not demanding a puritanical society where alcohol is not available but people must be given the full facts on the effects of alcohol consumption. An onus must be put on the drinks industry to balance its promotional advertising on the positive effects of alcohol and explain its downsides and the risks involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">I welcome the establishment of the National Office for Suicide Prevention. It has much work ahead of it. It was recommended in the Reach Out strategy for suicide prevention. The office informed the sub-committee that one of its main aims was to increase the number of counselling facilities offered at accident and emergency departments. Approximately 50% of accident and emergency departments have facilities for people who present in cases of self-harm. The office hopes to get this figure to 90%, which must be done without delay. The sub-committee also heard about the need for early intervention. We need better psychological services at infant and adolescent level. Children as young as seven years of age have attempted suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">National helplines for suicide prevention are often not available 24 hours a day. As with car crashes, there are certain peak times for suicides. It is fine having helplines available nine to five, but people do not necessarily commit suicide during these hours. Many groups find themselves unable to afford 24 hour helplines. The Government must assist in providing helplines, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Stigmatising suicide is a large aspect of the issue. The term "committing" resonates with the idea of committing a crime. It is a phrase that should be taken out of the lexicon. People who commit suicide have an illness. People suffering from depression need to be encouraged to come forward. However, they should not necessarily be treated at psychiatric units but at some alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">The statistics are bleak and there is much work to be done in this area. When the Minister of State receives the sub-committee's report in late December, I hope he will increase funding substantially to enable the National Office for Suicide Prevention to co-ordinate services, properly funding the voluntary agencies involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Another issue is that of those families left behind who must deal with bereavement through suicide. It is bad enough to lose a loved one through natural causes. Suddenly losing someone through suicide is, however, one event a family can never get over. All Members who have been to funerals sympathising with people in such circumstances will agree it is a horrible experience. Proper resources must be given to those agencies to provide counselling to bereaved families. I hope the Government will take stock of this. It must match the funding for suicide prevention with that for road safety, particularly as more people commit suicide every year than are killed in road accidents.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_132">Suicide is a subject that until recently people did not like to confront. Society in general was in a state of denial, believing that if we ignored the subject it would go away. It has not gone away and is as large as life. Unfortunately in these circumstances "life" is the operative word, as it is snuffed out by a wilful action. At long last, however, society recognises we have a serious problem. Certain groups and services, especially the psychiatric services, say we have known for some time that suicide is a major problem. Regrettably, as Senator Browne pointed out, there is a stigma attached. It is not as bad as it was but we still have some distance to get rid of that stigma. It is important that people who might be listening today or reading a report pertaining to this session in Seanad Éireann realise that psychiatry, which is the area of medicine and nursing that deals with suicide, attempted suicide, depression and all the conditions that contribute to suicide, is not taken seriously enough. Decisions were taken some years ago by a number of Governments that resulted in a serious drop in the number of psychiatric nurses being trained, and in people training in medical psychiatry. They are contributing factors.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_63">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_134">We should get real. Community services have a pivotal role to play in suicide prevention. In the mid-1980s the report, The Psychiatric Services — Planning for the Future, was launched. That report needs to be reviewed urgently. Much was made of community services, which are a better service but far more expensive. We should not fool ourselves. Mr. P.J. Fitzpatrick, who was programme manager of community care with the former Midland Health Board at the same time I was a member, made the point exhaustively that we should develop our community services and our hospital services in tandem. We should not neglect hospital services like they did in Britain. Regrettably that has happened to some extent in this country. Thankfully, the intake of students into psychiatric nursing has improved immensely. The Midland Regional School of Nursing, established by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, is doing great work. Once again psychiatric nurses are being trained in the midlands, which was not the case for over 20 years. How can this House be serious about mental health and suicide statistics when a situation like that obtained for over 20 years?</p>
          <p eId="para_135">The ten year strategy developed by the programme management unit of the HSE and the National Suicide Review Group, supported by the Department of Health and Children, set out a range of actions to be taken by various State and non-governmental agencies on four different levels. This has been referred to by the Minister but I repeat, if only to underline it, that regarding suicide the population as a whole is a therapeutic community. It cannot be dealt with by the psychiatric services or the support services on their own — everybody has a role to play. Specific target groups such as young men and prisoners are vulnerable groups. Young men under 35 years of age account for approximately 40% of all suicide deaths, according to the Central Statistics Office. Over 11,000 cases of deliberate self-harm are seen in Irish hospitals every year, according to the National Parasuicide Registry. Some 21% of cases of deliberate self-harm are repeat acts. The highest rates of deliberate self-harm are among females aged 15 to 19 year olds. In a community sample of young men it was reported that 78% knew somebody, 42% knew more than one person and 17% knew a close friend who died by suicide. They are damning statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">There are not many families who have not been touched by the icy fingers of suicide, including my own. When it happens it is comparable to throwing a pebble into a pond and seeing a ripple effect. It goes from one side of the pond to the other. The emotions that surface among family and friends when a suicide occurs range from anger, when they ask how somebody could be so selfish to do that without thinking of others, to remorse and self-blame when they ask if they could have done something or recognised something was wrong. People will reflect that they suspected something was wrong but did nothing about it. Then depression ensues for those people, accelerated by self-blame. Thus the ripple effect extends from family to friends to neighbourhoods.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">Then there is the "DID" group, the dealers in death or the drug pushers. In my experience they have a pivotal role, as has alcohol. It has been proven by statistics that in a high percentage of suicides alcohol has been taken. I have regrettably come to realise in the past year or so that other substances as well as alcohol are involved in the many unprovoked attacks taking place in our society at the moment, in the depredation, the fights and the brawls we hear of. Yet people advocate the legalisation of a certain drug. We know what happened in Britain. It went down that route but has now retracted. History is a useful subject because if one learns from its mistakes one will not repeat them. Some people in this country want us to repeat the mistake of legalising cannabis. As a legislator that will never get my support.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">I agree with Senator Browne that the drinks industry has a case to answer. In many respects the industry glorifes alcohol products, such as alcopops, targeted specifically at young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">Certain commentators have unfairly vilified publicans. I do not agree with that approach as I know many publicans who are very responsible. Publicans are in the business of selling drink products, but if the drink product is not made it cannot be sold. There is a culture among young people where they wish to become intoxicated as quickly as possible, especially at the weekend. There is also a well-established practice of spiking drinks. I have stated before and I again contend that there should be a mandatory prison sentence for those who spike a drink. Alcohol is a social drug and people do not really worry about its cost. The main worry would be that it might become scarce.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">I am pleased to be a member of the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Health and Children dealing with the high levels of suicide in Ireland, although its operation clashes at times with events in the Seanad. It would be wonderful if we had bi-locational talents and could do several things at once. I am cursed with being human and can only be in one place at a time. As I play a minor role in this House I must attend the Order of Business and, regretfully, I cannot attend all the sessions of the sub-committee I would like.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The sub-committee had an excellent presentation by Professor Eadbhard O'Callaghan of DETECT, and one of his stronger points concerned early intervention. Such intervention saves lives and money while giving young people a chance. This country is playing catch-up to the rest of the world on this issue. There is also strong evidence suggesting that early intervention should be a core part of any effective suicide prevention strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Psychosis and the role psychosis plays in suicide was also referred to. It is a strong role. Professor O'Callaghan also explained the different types of psychosis, such as drug-induced psychosis. It may not be appreciated by many people who take drugs that the end result of such a practice is psychoses like organic psychosis; schizophrenia; bipolar syndrome, which is also known as manic depressive psychosis; or psychotic depression. There are 75,000 people with varying forms of psychosis in Ireland, which is a significant number. Schizophrenics account for 34,000 people in the country. The suicide rate for individuals with psychosis is 20 times the rate in the general population, a large discrepancy. This relates to my point on the importance of having a strong psychiatric service based in both the community and hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">A reduction in mental illness leads to a decrease in the danger of suicide. This can be related to the therapeutic community and the manner in which it can be developed. General practitioners, who currently carry out an excellent service, must be educated. They have a pivotal role in identifying in the first instance psychiatric disorder. They can contact a local psychiatric hospital or a community psychiatric nurse to enable at-risk patients to get help at an early stage. The development of child and adolescent psychiatry is imperative. A good service exists in the midlands, although it is not so good that it cannot be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">There is a large problem in the country with regard to suicide. The most important step in a journey of a million miles is the first step. An important step has been taken with the establishment of the National Office for Suicide Prevention, and I wish the office and those working in it well. I will do anything I can for it as a Member of this House and a concerned member of the community.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_64">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_145">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and recognise his commitment to the mental health services in the country. I was pleased to hear Senator Glynn speak before me, as his comments as someone who has experience working in the psychiatric services are very useful. I welcome the establishment of the National Office for Suicide Prevention, but how much more do we need to find out before action is taken on the issue? What worries me about the report and the discussion on it today is that there has been little concentration on the resources that are required to implement the recommendations within the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">We have seen report after report. Senator Browne mentioned the problem with alcohol and he is correct. There was an excellent report on deaths in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth in 2001 and 2002. There were other reports, such as the 2004 report from the National Suicide Research Foundation; the 1998 report from the national task force on suicide; the 2002 report from the strategic task force on alcohol, as Senator Browne pointed out; the 1991 report of the advisory group on prison deaths; and a 2001 report entitled Suicide in Ireland — A National Study. I could go on quoting even the home-grown reports. However, minimal action has been taken in areas outlined by Senator Glynn, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">Despite the publication of these reports, nothing has been done. Although we see the direction that should be taken no progress is made. I am pleased Senator Glynn highlighted the important issue of pre-existing mental illness in people who commit suicide or those who attempt suicide. We are on shaky ground by stating that much has been done over the past ten or 15 years to improve mental health treatment in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">The policy document Planning for the Future was published over 20 years ago. The report made the transition from large mental hospitals, which would hold about 30,000 people in custodial institutions, to care in the community. Senator Glynn is correct to say that care in the community is more expensive. This is the issue on which we are failing. Having brought people out into the community, we have not put in place teams which are now recognised as necessary to treat the people. Although the acute phase of an illness might be treated, a person might be left too much to his or her own devices with inadequate support and care.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">The report being discussed today makes for very interesting reading but it is profoundly depressing. With regard to the section on unemployed people committing suicide, we know that a third of those who commit suicide are unemployed at the time. We also know that a problem of homelessness exists in this city and the country as a whole. Even if a person gets into a hostel, it can be difficult for people to happily integrate into them because a considerable number of homeless people have mental illness that could be out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">How are we dealing with the problem? A psychiatrist to treat homeless people in the north Dublin area was appointed approximately six months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">She said she required a backup team. Members have heard Senator Glynn discuss the importance of teamwork in psychiatry nowadays whereby one needs psychiatric social workers, psychiatric nurses and communities in which patients are accepted. Unfortunately, some communities completely reject people who have had any psychiatric illness. While the psychiatrist asked for backup staff, she did not get them and the post was subsumed. What message does that send out about our commitment to people who are among the most vulnerable to committing suicide in this city? It sends an appalling message.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Some 14 beds in the Mater Hospital were to be allocated to deal with such patients when they became acutely ill. What happened? The beds were not put in place, apparently because the space pressures on the Mater Hospital are too great. We have a terrible problem regarding acute beds for mentally ill patients. While we try to treat them in general hospitals rather than mental hospitals these days, we have had much trouble in setting up such wards in the general hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">We also have a shortage of psychiatrists. I believe that approximately ten extra posts were created last year and the Minister has stated that a further 13 will be put in place next year, in the hope that my colleagues, the consultant psychiatrists, will become involved in the Mental Health Commission. It will be essential to start the mental health tribunals in operation. However, if those consultant psychiatrists who have been already put in place do not receive back-up support, we will have much trouble in persuading them that future promises will be any better than past events. I have received constant complaints from people installed in posts around the country that they have not received such support. For example, a psychiatrist was installed in Navan, where she eventually received an office. It was then discovered that the office did not have planning permission enabling her to consult with patients there, thus obliging her to see people in their homes. What productivity levels does that suggest? We must have some adequate planning and team structures. This is the most important way to go forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">On page 34 of the report, it is pointed out that in a recent review paper, it was reported that 97.3% of those who died by suicide had diagnosable mental illness. This refers to Arsenault and Lapierre's study of 2004. The authors note that caution should be exercised in interpreting such results, as many of the studies included in the review did not use a control sample. They examined more than 3,000 cases and reported on them. However in the report, Suicide in Ireland: A National Study, 47% of those who committed suicide could have been identified by a GP as having mental health problems. Senator Glynn has pointed out the importance of major depression in these circumstances. Senator Browne noted the effects of substance abuse. Personality disorders and psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are also significant. These are all recognisable conditions with which we should make an attempt to deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">We also have a serious problem regarding the lack of child and adolescent psychiatrists and facilities in which to treat such people. I believe there are six beds in Dublin and 14 in the west. While others have been promised, I do not know when they will come into effect. Frequently with mental illness, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. The situation regarding prisons is also appalling and it is reckoned that 30% of inmates have a psychiatric problem. While there has been an improvement in the number of psychiatrists working within the prison system, it is in no way adequate. We have an enormous responsibility to care for those whom we involuntarily detain within our prisons in the best possible manner. If such people commit suicide, Members, as legislators, will be held partially responsible for the inadequacy of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The situation regarding accident and emergency departments is also extremely important. Such departments are where one encounters parasuicides and such people should be referred immediately to psychiatric help. Can the Minister state that this happens? I do not believe so. Many such patients are referred from accident and emergency departments without adequate referral to psychiatric help. Sometimes, I have received complaints from general practitioners that they did not even know that their patients had in fact attended an accident and emergency department in such serious circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">To a great extent, we are obliged to rely on drug treatment for psychiatric illness. This is an international problem, rather than simply being an Irish problem. I visited the United States last week and listened to Dr. Tim Murphy, who is a Republican Party member of Congress and a psychologist, speak about the fact that 75% of anti-depressants in the United States are prescribed by non-psychiatrists. While I do not claim that one must be a psychiatrist to prescribe such drugs, they are extremely potent. It is important to remember — it is far more common in the United States than here — that the psychotropic drugs prescribed for children are never tested on them and a considerable number of such drugs are not recommended by their manufacturers for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">How are general practitioners supposed to deal with such children if they cannot get help for them from specialists in child and adolescent psychiatry or if they cannot procure verbal therapy, such as the services of psychologists or psychotherapists for them either? These two professions are also in short supply. This has led to concerns on the part of members of the public whose closest relatives have been prescribed drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, that these were the cause of the patient committing suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">When Dr. Murphy spoke in Congress, he made a good point, namely, that when people were put on such treatment, their initial improvement might have led us to believe they were doing better than was the case. Subsequently, those who were not experts in the area let their guards down, so that sufficient supports of other kinds were not given to such patients. Hence, they committed suicide due to lack of support rather than due to the effects of the drug itself. There have been many claims made in the United States and the United Kingdom about these drugs but no proof has been forthcoming that they were the cause of suicide. We must be cautious about damning drugs which have been useful in some cases. Nevertheless, I have practised medicine for long enough to have seen many drugs prescribed, particularly in psychiatry, which were considered to be entirely unsuitable ten years later. This is an area on which I hope the Irish Medicines Board is keeping a close eye.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">As I have stated, the lack of specific resources is what really troubles me about this issue. Sometimes, my breath is taken away by the manner in which legislation is introduced in these Houses with a lack of concern for the resources. When the Mental Health Act passed through this House, I raised the issue of resources and they were considered to be important by the Minister at the time. However, considering the current dispute with the consultant psychiatrists, in some cases they have a choice of leaving their patients to attend the tribunals in situations where no locum is available to deal with the patients in their absence. If they do not attend the tribunal and adhere to the law, they may be very heavily fined or imprisoned. They will be in a difficult situation unless more resources are invested in the area to ensure that neither the patients they have nor the patients who should be before the tribunals are neglected.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">It is wrong that such a high proportion of patients are held involuntarily in this country, a higher proportion than most countries in Europe, and that we have not managed to establish the tribunals. I do not know whether it was helpful for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to start telling the consultants they will not get their 1.6% benchmarking increase unless they co-operate; half of that 1.6% will vanish in tax. It was not a tactful comment by the Tánaiste.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_163">I thank the Minister of State for correcting me. I will speak about another Minister, one who is closer to home for the Minister of State. When the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 was before this House, the explanatory memorandum indicated that it had no financial implications. Have we ever heard of any legislation that did not have financial implications? Of course it will have financial implications as the same type of tribunals were to be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">That legislation left this House in a worse state than when it came in. I will address one of its worst aspects. When it came before the House, it was agreed that a patient, who was a prisoner and had no choice but to be a patient in those circumstances, would get care and treatment. I tabled an amendment to the effect that the entire Bill would hold that a prisoner who became a patient would get care and treatment because it read "care or treatment" in places. What happened? All of the changes were made in the opposite direction so that the prisoner who was a patient would get care or treatment. This is outrageous. All of these reports are splendid but, when we examine mental health in this manner, they are only paying lip-service to a very depressing situation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_67">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_165">I welcome the Minister of State. The last time I spoke about suicide in the House was May of this year and one of my primary concerns at that time was that statements would be reduced to a web of words and spun around numbers, namely, statistics, numbers of deaths and levels of investment. I tried to concentrate on the heart of the issue and completed my contribution without referring to a single statistic. It is with great relief, for want of a better word, that we are concentrating on an actual strategy this time. The bleak picture painted by statements dominated by numbers of deaths provided no optimism for bereaved families, society or policy makers.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">No one could be criticised for saying no optimism is possible on the topic of suicide but I cannot accept that. I thank the Health Boards Executive, its director, Mr. Denis Doherty, the lead chief executive officer, Mr. Paul Robinson, the National Suicide Review Group under the chairmanship of Mr. Geoff Day, the steering and reference groups, the Department of Health and Children and the many others who contributed to this strategy. In doing so, they have shone a light on a truly bleak and dark issue. I specifically thank and congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, not just for his contribution today but for his ongoing dedication to tackling some of society's most difficult problems in his challenging portfolio and doing so with a quiet and effective determination that deserves great credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I was struck by the vision statement of the Reach Out strategy: "A society where life is valued across all age groups, where the young learn from and are strengthened by the experiences of others and where the needs of those who are going through a hard time are met in a caring way." When we see these words before us, it is quite stark as many assume this is the way society is. We take it for granted. However, the Reach Out strategy does us a great service by reminding us this is not the case. It reminds us to think about people, especially younger people who are experiencing a hard time.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">This is something else we take for granted, namely, young people are universally exuberant, resilient, lively and up for a laugh or when they go through a down patch, it is just a mood, a phase, some trivial issue magnified by the naiveté of youth, that it will pass and there is no need for concern. The Reach Out strategy again does us a great service by reminding us this is not the case. For example, included in the strategy's list of some of the signs that someone may be in trouble is a sudden change in mood. When those involved are younger people, we should not glibly pass it over and put it down to typical teenage behaviour and mood swings.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The second important feature of the strategy is its quick movement from the valuable vision statement to the principle that the strategy is action focused, which brings me back to the dominating feeling of pessimism that shrouds this issue. The pessimism is based on the frequently arising question, "suicide is so awful, so incomprehensible, what can we do, what could we have done?". The need for action to help provide answers applies on two levels. At the higher strategic level, the fact that the strategy is practical, achievable, based on evidence and international best practice and will be the subject of ongoing regular evaluation to determine whether the expected outcomes have been achieved is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The next level involves the action for families and communities. The strategy correctly places this action in the context of the changing nature of the family unit, the move away from traditional extended family structures towards tighter nuclear and single parent families, increased pressure on parents and the consequent strains on relationships. This change in family structures is related to and compounded by changing work practices and living arrangements and locations. The Reach Out strategy wisely situates plans for actions in the context of these challenges to family cohesion. We yet again see a policy area become more and more complex as our society changes in terms of our interactions, communities, work and life balances. While these factors usually inform the House on discussions, such as on transport infrastructure, we are speaking about implications of life and death in this case. It is a serious matter but the strategy is so well put together that it comprehends these complex challenges and, to its immense credit, seeks to address them practically rather than leaving them floating and sustaining the aforementioned sense of helplessness and pessimism.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">In recognition of our changing communities, the strategy suggests some practical measures, such as the delivery of community education on suicide prevention and mental health promotion, including public lecture series and awareness talks. These should include invited participation from specific occupations that are often well placed as gatekeepers within the community, such as taxi drivers, post office workers, shopkeepers and pharmacists. This considered and excellent strategy document contains many other examples of practical actions correctly placed in the context of all of the challenges to family cohesion and is to be commended on doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">It would be impossible in these few minutes to expand upon all the exceptional work contained in the strategy's 84 pages. When I last spoke on this subject, I concluded with the following words, "We must take every opportunity to get the message across that people should never feel there is nowhere to turn. Help is available and suicide is never the answer to whatever problems people encounter in modern Ireland". In essence, I was calling for people to reach out. The title of this strategy is apt and right. This is a two-way street. We must reach out to people at risk, younger people especially and younger men in particular. They must feel that when they reach out, a hand is there for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The importance of this two-way process is emphasised in the report, where it states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_174">It is important to stress that the general population approach to suicide prevention and targeting those who are known to be at increased risk should be complementary approaches. By effectively developing an anti-stigma campaign and by promoting awareness of positive mental health, the likelihood of vulnerable individuals with signs of mental health problems seeking help through the health services will increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">We must do all we can, and I do not mean as policy makers but as members of society, members of our particular communities, consumers of media who can shape content, friends, relatives and even as strangers.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">I cannot overstate the value of this strategy. I congratulate and thank all who worked on it. I sincerely hope it will lead us on the path to tackling this dreadful stigma in as much as it is possible to do so. This is both an imperative and a duty for all true members of society. I congratulate the Minister and the group who put the strategy together. Those of us who study the strategy and accept its recommendations must contribute in every way we can to its implementation within our communities and in society as a whole. On this day people can proudly state they made a valuable contribution to the strategy, as we continue in our fight to rid the country of this horrific stigma.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_68">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_177">I stated previously when discussing suicide and other similar tragedies that I am reluctant to get involved in Government bashing. That reluctance is not my normal style but apart from a couple of comments I will not do so. The strategy was slow to arrive and, as with many issues, the Government did not appear to wake up to the scale of the problem until quite late into its second term.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Psychiatric services have always been the poor relations in the health services and I happily accept that is true not only during the term of office of the present Government. I do not know if that will change under the new regime. There is no doubt that every time a shortage of funds or a serious constraint occurred, one of the areas where health service managers in both the HSE and its predecessors sought cutbacks quickly was in psychiatric services. I have reason to be aware of that from family connections. Delay upon delay occurred in services for people with psychiatric illnesses. I know this from listening to long late-night conversations between a consultant psychiatrist and various junior doctors about where a bed might be found for a seriously ill patient. I know only too well about the scarcity of beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">The Minister of State is always welcome and I stated previously in his presence that if everybody who threatened self-harm or stated they were suicidal were to be hospitalised, not only would every acute bed in psychiatric services be occupied, but also every acute bed in every hospital. Professional judgments must be made and we must ensure that we have the professional skills available, everywhere and all of the time, to make good professional judgments in these cases. I take it from the strategy that we are endeavouring to do so. We must ensure that people who are seriously at risk are not turned away. At the same time we cannot have a policy of admitting everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The late and much lamented Dr. Michael Kelleher stated on many occasions that we would be foolish to view suicide as a predominantly urban phenomenon. Dr. Kelleher's figures, which are a few years old, show that suicide was an acute rural problem, particularly suicide outside younger age groups. It was a product of isolation, old age and loneliness.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I cannot take issue with the national strategy, although perhaps €500,000 is little more than a token gesture for a strategy to deal with one of the most heartbreaking problems the country has. The Government might not be correct to leave out targets although it may be correct to delay setting targets because current figures are unreliable. However, it should only be delayed until reliable figures are established. The Government's strategy should then be to match the best that has been achieved internationally. I would have some sympathy with that, but not much.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I will assume the strategy is delivered for the purposes of this debate. I would find it distasteful to recite my usual scepticism about the Government in this area because I wish it well on this. I wish to believe it is a serious attempt that will be followed through and is not merely an exercise to grab headlines and prove the Government is taking action. I am increasingly sceptical about the school of politics that believes action must be taken. Action that makes a difference must be taken. Politicians must not merely be seen to take action.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I will accept the strategy will be followed through, properly funded and universally available. I hope that subsumed into it will be the beginnings of an awareness, not merely in our psychiatric and medical services but also in our society, of the actions we are taking with regard to young men in particular and young people generally. Only four or five years have passed since a member of the same class as my then 14 year old son committed suicide. As a parent I cannot imagine much worse that could happen to a family than for any member to commit suicide, particularly a child. Even though I talk about it, I never really want to think about it. Nobody would. It had a profound effect on every member of that class, which will work its way through each one. I knew most of them. They were sensible, good natured, fairly well focused and stable boys and girls from a variety of backgrounds, and it will reverberate through their lives. One only hopes some good will come of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">In that context let us remember the pressures on young men. I do not excuse wrong behaviour, but any self-aware young man faces a range of expectations. He is probably expected to do extremely well academically, because everybody now expects to do well. Large numbers of parents cannot accept that not all their children are academically brilliant — they blame an illness or the school — and children are at the centre of enormous ambition and pressure. In my other work I have seen youngsters reluctant to tell their parents that they got only second class degrees. While they had achieved the level anticipated by their lecturers, their parents had never adjusted to this expectation.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Young people are fed an illusion that people have limitless income. They are launched into a world where to buy is to be. Every real person is aware that this is illusory, but young people are subject to a range of pressures. As many people working in sport will attest, there is an increasing expectation to be macho. It is disappointing that people working with young people in sport say it is more difficult than ever to persuade youngsters not to retaliate if they are fouled. One is tough only if one retaliates while not to retaliate is regarded, more than previously, as a sign of weakness. It is more difficult to explain the rationale for not retaliating. I invite anyone who shares this view to read Roy Keane's biography, in which he flagellates himself for his lack of maturity when he retaliated.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I hope Members do not snigger at my next point. Therapists tell me there is an increasing expectation on young men to perform as studs in a way that did not exist ten years ago. I am told that significant numbers of young men have stopped socialising because they cannot handle expectations about their capacity to perform sexually. Those factors, along with an increasingly sexualised culture, in which children are sexualised from the age of ten years, put at risk people who are already vulnerable as they go through changes that happen at different rates in each person.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">I take issue from an intellectual, not a political, position with many of the values of the Government. I do not say that the Government created these values but it articulates them well. We have an individualistic culture based on the illusion of instant gratification, where any suggestion of delayed gratification — that sometimes one must do without or make sacrifices — has no merit. I know what competition does in terms of economic performance, but inside every increasingly competitive market are human beings who have limited ability to cope with the increasing pressures of work and performance. People who work in financial services say it is standard practice to increase targets each year. If one fails to achieve a target one is in trouble. If one does achieve it, the target is ratcheted up the following year. That sort of expectation has an unimaginable impact on young people. The response is the work hard, play hard culture, and playing hard usually means alcohol. The Minister of State knows better than I, not because of his drinking habits but because of his profession, that alcohol is a depressant. If people are suffering from the pressures of life and feeling overwhelmed by them, the worst thing they can do is try to drown their sorrows. In the long term it will exacerbate their depression. Our society promotes a way of life that makes bad situations worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">I have frequently spoken in this House of the illusion that Governments, not just the present one, try to reward effort. In fact, we do not reward effort but success, and we brand people who are not successful as "losers". This is one of the most offensive terms but it is common parlance now. In conclusion, somebody on the political left must deal with these issues because most of society runs away from them. One of our problems is that society has changed profoundly and every signpost of good ethical behaviour is gone. All the institutions that offered ethical guidance are either impoverished or undermined by their own misbehaviour, and the Minister knows what I am talking about. Our young people are floundering without a moral compass. They have the illusion of escape given by such people as Kurt Cobain. We must re-establish an ethical consensus. Scandinavian countries, where there is no strong religious tradition, have a social ethic. If we are about to move away from a religious ethic as the compass by which we live our lives, we need to replace that with a social ethic based on a set of values, one of which is that human life is precious and that suicide is never an acceptable response to a human crisis.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_69">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_189">I welcome the Minister of State. I congratulate the HSE, the health boards before them and the Department of Health and its staff on the national strategy document. It is a comprehensive and targeted document that includes 26 areas of action. It shows us the way forward. From 2005 to 2014 may seem like a long time but that indicates the complexity of this issue, and it is probably one of the most complex and perplexing issues to face the country. The statistics on suicide in Ireland are frightening. When one considers that this the most common cause of death among our young people today, we all have a role and an obligation to try to reduce the incidence of suicide and to find alternatives for people who are vulnerable, specifically young people. In a recent report, the OECD pointed out that out of a group of 30 countries Ireland has the second highest rate of suicide among people under 25 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The stigma attached to suicide, depression and mental illness in general is still a huge issue for people in this country. The stigma it brings to a family is probably the most difficult type to deal with and its consequences are deep and long lasting. It has been pointed out that due to the changing nature of our family structures, it is becoming more difficult for people to cope with daily life. In the national study conducted in 2001, which was mentioned by other speakers, it was found that two thirds of those who died by suicide lived at home with other family members. The family unit is a crucial target when building awareness, as is pointed out by the strategy. It is also crucial in building supports for people who might be vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I have teenage children and I see how difficult life is for them compared to my teenage years. There are many more pressures, be it peer pressure, media pressure and so forth. Time has brought social changes. Marriage break up and divorce put huge pressure on people. Everybody copes with situations such as bereavement, family separation and so forth in different ways but young people need support and reassurance. How they grow up, get through school and deal with their family, friends and the wider community will play a part in how the person deals with any stress and particularly with severe stress.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The strategy points out that statutory agencies have a crucial role to play. There is particular emphasis on schools. The strategy recognises the role of schools in building up a positive attitude to mental well being and in building up resilience among young people. From primary school to third level, major advances have been made through the inclusion of mental health issues in the curriculum and in the provision of staff and resources. SPHE is a welcome initiative which has proven very successful. It is now compulsory in secondary schools. It plays a vital role in making young people aware and in strengthening the links between education and health.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">In my constituency I work with various groups and schools and I see how these programmes work. Under the home school liaison programme staff visit young people in their homes. They see their living conditions, the parental arrangements and the community in which they live. These initiatives can play a huge role in dealing with suicide prevention. One of the Senators mentioned early intervention programmes. The younger the age at which these take place, the better. When one talks to children about these matters it is difficult for them to understand at first but as they grow older and take part in programmes such as SPHE, they quickly get a good grasp of the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Other groups have a vital role in dealing with this issue, particularly youth groups, clubs and organisations. The strategy refers to this. The National Youth Council, the National Youth Federation, Foróige, Gaisce, the Catholic Youth Council, Macra na Feirme, the Union of Students in Ireland, Comhairle le Leasóige and many more groups were consulted and asked for their inputs when the strategy was being compiled. These groups have vast experience dealing with young people and the population in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The strategy also points to the importance of sports and organised activities in suicide prevention. Sport provides positive role models. The Department, in fact, has been concentrating on selecting good role models for young people. All studies show that suicide victims are more likely not to be members of organised clubs or organisations. This is an area where we can act. I have seen the benefits of investing through the young persons' services and facilities fund in different areas, particularly areas of disadvantage. Suicide as an issue does not recognise class barriers but in some areas of disadvantage life is more difficult for children. The more we invest in these areas, the better. Greater investment in sports facilities, play areas, buildings and rooms for organisations and sports clubs will bring us greater benefit in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The strategy examined the detailed causes of suicide. Alcohol and drug abuse are major factors. We have made progress in highlighting this link but we must do more to underline for young people the connection between these factors and suicide. One study showed that in 90% of suicides either a mental illness, such as depression or schizophrenia, or an intoxicant problem was present. That is a startling statistic. We must use imaginative ways of attracting young people's attention to explain this to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">We must change the way suicide is reported. It is accepted that the incidence of suicide is under-reported. Coroners' hands are tied in cases involving car crashes or poisoning where, due to a lack of evidence, they cannot be reported as suicides. That is another matter that must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Everybody has a role to play in dealing with this issue. The strategy shows the way forward. It provides for ongoing monitoring and research and I believe it will prove to be of benefit in the future. The strategy relates to the period 2005 to 2014, which might appear to be a long time but this is a very complex issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_201">The last time the Seanad discussed suicide was in May this year but it is fitting that we again debate it in the context of Reach Out — A National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-2014. That we are debating the issue is important. For too long, people, including politicians, were wary and shied away from discussing suicide. It is refreshing that there is now more openness and that people are prepared to talk about the subject rather than brush it under the carpet, which was previously the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">We must examine and debate how the cultural and economic changes that have taken place in Ireland over the past decade have detached people from traditional values and support. That might also have a formal link with mental health and suicidal behaviour. Influencing the way individuals react to changes in their social life will be central to the prevention of suicide. Young people tend to be hard on themselves. Success is increasingly an important goal in society. Individual success appears to be even more important. This places great pressures on young people. Their perception is that anything can be achieved if one works hard and is smart but if one fails, it must be down to oneself. Society seems to no longer help those who fail or those who perceive themselves as failures.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">The uncertainties of life are increasing, as we are all aware. Life seems dictated by what we can own, what we can buy and what brand one wears. Young people are faced with choices that would have been unthinkable in previous generations. At the same time the cultural icons of the past, such as the church and our own political establishments, have been debased in the eyes of the young.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">One may ask are adolescents more vulnerable to perceived failure today or is it that they are less likely to ask for help. The pressure to succeed academically at all costs is another area which needs to be examined. Suicide prevention is not just another health issue; it is also an educational issue. That has been pointed out in the report which emphasises that there is a greater need for more education in letting people know how they can solve their problems, how they can talk about issues and that help is available. Research, understanding and analysis of the pressures on young people are vital if we are to address this epidemic of suicide. We must regard suicide prevention as a multidimensional area that requires promotion and investment. This also comes out strongly in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">International research has proven that there is a link between alcohol consumption and suicidal behaviour. Alcohol consumption leads to depression which is a major factor in suicide and suicidal behaviour. Likewise, depressed people frequently turn to alcohol in the mistaken belief that it will improve their mood. We all know that alcohol impairs judgment, reduces inhibition, increases risk taking behaviour and may result in impulsive suicide and suicidal behaviour, most frequently in the young.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">There has been report after report. What we need now is action and the provision of resources to implement the various recommendations, not only in this latest report but in other reports, especially the report of the National Suicide Review Group which was set up in 1998. Fewer than ten of the 86 recommendations of the national task force on suicide have been implemented. Reports are welcome but are useless unless we are prepared to provide the resources to implement their recommendations. I urge the Minister of State to secure the necessary funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">I acknowledge the Minister of State's commitment to mental health but the reduction in the level of investment in the psychiatric services is unforgivable. In 1997 such spending formed 13% of the total health budget whereas it now forms 7%. There is a need to act on that. I strongly urge the Minister of State to secure the necessary funding and ensure that the recommendations of this fine report are implemented.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_73">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_208">I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Cummins, for making some time available for me to make a couple of clear and specific points and recommendations. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, will bear them in mind and take them to his colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">This is a serious issue. Senators will be aware that committees of both Houses have looked at it in some detail and obtained expert evidence. According to the figures available to me, in 1993 some 360 people committed suicide. The suicide figure peaked in 1998 at 504 and it is now increasing again towards the 500 mark, which is very regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">There are vulnerable groups, a number of which have been mentioned here. There is also the issue which arose on the Order of Business today. Among those vulnerable groups are the victims of sexual abuse, both by the clergy and the laity. Among the recommendations from everywhere, both in this country and abroad, is education, and particularly education on matters of sexual identity, etc. Unfortunately, conservative church groups opposed the Stay Safe programme, for example. The Government needs to take its courage in its hands, go into areas and not be put off by opposition from these kinds of groups. Those bodies, which are in difficulties now because of an abrogation of their responsibility to the vulnerable young people, were exempted by what I described this morning as a craven Parliament from the operation of the equality laws. I hope we have learned our lessons.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I want to look at a couple of because we know that there are marginalised groups that are more likely to encounter this difficulty, the first of which is asylum seekers and refugees. We must monitor that group much more carefully. There was a report in <i>Metro Éireann</i>, the newspaper of the asylum seekers and refugees in Ireland, of a Nigerian man who came here. He was here for three or four years with his partner by whom he had a son. He was an inoffensive man. He wanted to get refugee status and it was denied. Then he looked for it on compassionate grounds. The authorities were proposing to deport him to Nigeria, a country which we know from the newspapers is not safe for anybody. There was a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week of a Nigerian police officer who ran amuck and shot six people in the back of a car, and then planted evidence on them suggesting that they were robbers. Life is cheap in such countries. The man to whom I referred was served with a deportation order, went missing, committed suicide and was found on 11 September on the beach at Skerries. We know that is a vulnerable group.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The other group to which I wish to refer is that of young gay people. There is clear indication that young males are about four times more likely to commit suicide than young females. Within that group, young gay people are at least three times more likely to commit suicide. Internationally, sometimes this rate is much higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The national strategy for action on suicide prevention mentions this and refers to the various marginalised groups, particularly gay people, the bullying in school, etc. However, the report's recommendations are very weak. It is ridiculous. They include a recommendation to determine the risk of engaging in suicidal behaviour associated with belonging to this group. We know this already and if we do not, why do we not? The survey done in the North on the vulnerability of this group could not be more clear about what needs to be done, that is, education about sexual identity in the schools, but nobody is prepared to do it. Nobody is prepared to require that it be done in case it might conflict with the ethos of a group that has presided over the serial molestation of children. That is a real dereliction of responsibility on the part of Government. One cannot fault the church altogether for sticking up for what it sees as its territory — it is a natural institutional response — but the Government should now have the courage to take on this matter. The report makes vague recommendations about developing educational resources, etc. I agree, but let us be clear and specific. Let us have an education programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I would recommend the Belong To group and its report to the Minister of State. That group points out that being bullied and victimised, particularly in school and in their local communities, is the primary issue for young gay people. There is a lack of support and lack of inclusion of issues affecting lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people in school. We know, from the North, that young gay people are five times more likely to be medicated for depression, two and a half times more likely to commit self-harm and at least three times more likely to commit suicide. We also know that there is a complete absence of real educational support for these young people in school. The report also makes clear that approximately 90% of young people in school know their sexual identity by the age of 14, but they get no support.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I wish to relate to the House some of the sad human messages that come from the background of the Northern Ireland report. One young person said that when in his last year at school he contemplated telling people he was gay, but some of them made derogatory remarks about queers and so he kept quiet. Another stated that a neighbour told his parents and they threw him out saying he was disgusting. He then stayed with some friends but could not get his own place because he was in school. A third said that when the church groups he helped for his Duke of Edinburgh award discovered his sexuality, they asked him to leave as they did not feel it appropriate. A fourth said he approached a youth leader for support. However, he was told to go home and not talk about being gay.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I remind the Minister of State that we know these groups. I speak with particular passion because I have known young people who have committed suicide at an early age. We know that the most vulnerable are young, gay people. The suicide ratio is 4:1 male to female and 3:1 inside that group are young, gay people. Often, this does not come out because the family is ashamed and does not want it to be known that the son was gay. I understand that. There is a problem. We know what it is and how to address it. It is up to the Government to have the courage to do that.</p>

          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_217">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I compliment him on the work done in the area of mental health. In many ways the Minister of State is the human face of corporate government. It is relevant to touch on that aspect of his portfolio today.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Over the years the issue of suicide has been raised several times on the Order of Business in this House. This generally reflected some experience some Member had in his or her community in the preceding days. Most of us have experienced suicide in our communities. We often ask whether people close to the person who died by suicide observed anything in the person's behaviour relevant to the suicide. In most cases we are told there was nothing, that the person, usually young males but sometimes females, was quite normal. We often ask ourselves whether something could have been done to help the young person. There is severe trauma for a family in that position whose members continually ask the same question over and over again.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Many speakers have dealt with fundamental issues such as the changes that have taken place in society and family structures, the difficulties facing young people, drugs and alcohol, etc. We welcome the national strategy, but as I am sure most people agree, it remains to be tested. While it is important we have a strategy, we must build a bridge between it and the changes taking place in society. We cannot deal with the issue in isolation or without looking at how community and society have changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Recently, Professor Puttnam, an adviser to former President Clinton, came here from Boston's Harvard University. He spoke about how communities had disintegrated in America and pointed out that the same thing was happening in Ireland and in most developed countries. We did not really need him to tell us this because there is nobody in this Chamber who has not thought the same at some stage, but we have felt particularly helpless about doing anything about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Two or three decades ago, at the start of what might be regarded as the "new liberated generation", people were particularly cautious about making any comment that might cast them as being out of touch or not politically correct. Having come through that so-called liberated period, many of that generation now comment on what they were deprived of in their lives. Most often they were deprived of an anchor at a time they needed it most. The title of this strategy, Reach Out, is significant in this regard. Often we acquiesce and do not examine what is happening in society, particularly with regard to the media, entertainment, education pressures and the various challenges facing people today. We should try to revisit what Tony Blair calls basics but what I would term fundamentals.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">We can speak out now. I do not believe we will be castigated for asking ourselves to review the good progress we have made and, at the same time, what we have lost in the process. Senator Brady was right to say that we must provide particular amenities, sporting, artistic and cultural. In fairness, in our new found affluence most Governments have focused on doing something in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">There is something else we must bear in mind and that is the terrible trauma that attaches to suicide. It was wrong to stigmatise suicide, because that added to a family's trauma. However, we must be careful that we do not glorify suicide. I know of situations where well-meaning people brought classmates together on the death of a young person through suicide and where almost a celebration took place. We must be particularly careful that we do not bring the wrong influence on young people in this regard. Young person dying by suicide are crying out for help, but they also seem to expect to be at their own funeral. They expect to experience the response to that cry. It is important, therefore, that we do not glorify suicide. We need to discuss this aspect of suicide openly through fundamental education so that young people are not drawn into the belief that by taking their life they will be celebrated later by their peer group. I was surprised when I heard of some of these gatherings, although I believe those who organised them were well-meaning.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The point I make now is not intended as a response to Senator Norris. In some way I am responding to a debate we had here this morning on the Order of Business. I will not go into the particular issues involved. We should not overlook that fact that over past decades the church — all churches — provided a positive service to young people. The more faith is diminished or diluted, the more we remove confidence and hope from young people at the time they need it most. I do not want to sound as if I am giving a sermon, but I believe this is relevant. Senators Ryan and Cummins touched on this same issue. If we do not give young people a basis for hope in this world and the next, we will take away a tool which can help them and which helped previous generations. I hope we do not castigate the agencies and groups which helped us in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The strategy must interact with all the elements mentioned today and take cognisance of the broader issues. It highlights the fact that suicide is such a complex issue that one cannot focus exclusively on any one section or item. It is a starting point based on a positive rather than a pessimistic approach. It is for this reason that we must all welcome it but we must also understand it and try to play an active role.</p>

        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_75">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_226">I thank Senators for giving me the opportunity to discuss Reach Out — A National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention 2005-14. The Irish translation — tabhair dom do lámh — might better express the aim of the strategy. I appreciate the contributions of Members of this House to the debate on what is an extremely complex issue facing Ireland and other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The importance of exploring the causes of and ways of dealing with suicide and suicidal behaviour cannot be over-emphasised. The overriding theme of our efforts to tackle the problem of suicide in Ireland is collaboration. If we tackle suicide as a one issue policy, we will fail. Our collective attempts to prevent suicide and reduce the suicide rate are at the heart of all our policies, whether they relate to economics, regeneration, social justice, inequality, education, health, local government, communities, children, better public services or improved mental health care. All of these issues have been alluded to by various Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Suicide affects all age groups and communities. Few people are untouched by the devastating effects of suicidal behaviour in their lifetime. The emotional, social and practical repercussions of suicide are felt by family members, friends, neighbours, colleagues and those working in a wide range of services and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Many factors put a person at risk of suicide. They include changing societal trends, including an increase in marital breakdown and divorce; insecurity of employment; high prevalence of alcohol problems and substance abuse; social values; attitudes to mental illness and mental health; suicidal behaviour; domestic abuse; stigma; poverty and inequality; inadequate social support such as low levels of practical, emotional and other forms of assistance from family, friends and neighbours and experience of sexual and physical abuse or bullying.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I must comment on the Ferns inquiry report, which is devastating. We are all diminished by what happened in the diocese. Many priests around the country feel very inadequate because of what has happened there. A considerable amount of bullying must have been a component of the abuse that occurred and which led to suicides. We know from the report that some suicides occurred as a result of this sad episode. I commend Bishop Eamonn Walsh on his forthright behaviour and facing up to the problems in the diocese. The Government faces the considerable challenge of dealing with the issues involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Low self-esteem and lack of confidence are other factors often associated with suicide. The list of factors I have mentioned is not exhaustive. The relationship between these factors and suicidal behaviour is complex and none should be addressed in isolation. For example, long-term factors such as the impact of being unemployed for over a year should be differentiated from short-term triggers such as recent redundancy. We need, therefore, to consider ways in which policies and actions to prevent suicide can be made sensitive to the specific circumstances and needs of particular groups on the basis of age, gender, etc., and in particular settings such as schools, workplaces and urban and rural areas. In this regard, the work of the suicide resource officers who were appointed in each of the former health boards is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">It might be useful if Senators contacted the suicide resource officers in their area who do excellent work and are involved in the community in respect of all the issues pertaining to mental health and suicide prevention. They work in schools and communicate with people. I have met several officers who are excellent individuals. I exhort Senators to utilise this resource. The Senators who stated nothing was being done to prevent suicide are diminishing the work of these officers who are doing excellent work and need their support. They also engage in the promotion of positive mental health and the destigmatisation of suicide and provide information on the issue of suicide and parasuicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Senators are aware that many suicide prevention initiatives are being undertaken, one of which is the appointment of liaison psychiatric nurses to accident and emergency departments of many general hospitals to deal with persons who present following an attempted suicide. The provision of this service ensures patients with psychological problems presenting at general hospitals are dealt with promptly and that they are referred to the mental health service for further support, if necessary. This benefits the patient but also ensures the more efficient use of medical and surgical services in accident and emergency departments. Other initiatives include the provision of training for health service staff and public information campaigns.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">The Health Service Executive plays a major role in co-ordinating efforts to help reduce the level of suicide and parasuicide. The new National Office for Suicide Prevention, established after the launch of the strategy, is responsible for overseeing implementation of the strategy, a fundamental aim of which is to prevent suicidal behaviour, including deliberate self-harm, and increase awareness of the importance of good mental health among the general population. Ongoing, high quality, multidisciplinary research will be an essential strand of the strategy and the findings will be of greatest value where they can inform and stimulate action and service development. The strategy identifies expected outcomes and sets targets which can be measured, monitored and revised. Continuous quality control and ongoing modification and improvement of the strategy will be central to its implementation. It is important to stress that it is action-based and builds on existing policy, as outlined in the national task force on suicide's report in 1998. The strategy is practical, achievable and based on evidence and international best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">I appeal once again to psychiatrists who recently declined to participate in mental health tribunals following year long negotiations with the Government to reconsider their decision. They were offered 13 additional consultant psychiatrist posts which would have cost the Health Service Executive approximately €10 million but they declined the offer. We are dealing with the most vulnerable in society — those involuntarily detained in mental institutions. As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, I am aware that the provision of resources is an issue but so are the human rights of the most vulnerable in our society. I appeal to psychiatrists to engage in these tribunals. If they decide not to do so, the Government will be forced to take alternative measures to get the tribunals up and running. It must deal with a situation outside its control.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Senator Henry mentioned the use of psychiatric drugs and argued that consultant psychiatrists and GPs were forced to use psychotropic drugs because of a lack of counsellors and psychotherapists. As a former pharmacist, I am aware of the very serious debate taking place about many of these drugs. Senator Henry has mentioned some of the new drugs which are available such as barbiturates, amphetamines, benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. There is increasing evidence of the problems associated with such drugs. We were told when they appeared on the market that they were non-addictive and that they were the best thing since the sliced pan. After ten years of the use of the drugs in question, we know certain problems are associated with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I ask Senators to be objective when they listen to experts speaking about mental health matters. I have a major problem with the influence the pharmaceutical industry exerts on the medical profession, especially the psychiatric sector, and on the postgraduate education of doctors. I recently heard a psychiatrist from the United States speak during the Lilly bipolar lecture tour of this country's three principal cities. Given that the lecture tour was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company, how could the psychiatrist in question be objective? The psychiatrist said on national radio that if one was diagnosed with a mental illness, one would be on drug therapy for the rest of one's life. That is wrong. I ask Senators to challenge the so-called experts who make such comments. Some are experts, but others are not. Some are influenced by the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The Government which has already done a great deal in this regard will continue to do everything it can to ensure more counsellors and psychotherapists are employed. There is increasing evidence that we need oral forms of therapy in order that those who wish to speak to others can do so. Many Senators mentioned the changes in our society. One of the most significant social changes has been that people are spending more time watching television. They are less likely to interact with and speak to each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">I thank Senators for inviting me to come to the House to listen to their views on this hugely important matter that affects every part of Ireland. The last time we discussed the issue of suicide Senator Maurice Hayes made the important point that North-South co-operation was needed in this regard. I will take steps to facilitate such co-operation. The expert group on mental health will refer to suicide when it reports to me in the near future. I look forward to the enactment of the strategy's recommendations. Senator Ryan said it was in gestation for a long time, but that was necessary because a large amount of work had to be done to ensure the right strategy was prepared. I am happy that we have published the right strategy. It is up to us to ensure it works.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelTracey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_76">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_240">Is cúis áthais dom an deis seo a bheith agam labhairt i Seanad Éireann faoi chlár athchóirithe na hEorpa chun slí eacnamaíoch na hEorpa a fheabhsú faoi Chlár Lisbon. Tá mé ag súil go mbainfimid taitneamh as an díospóireacht agus go nglacfaidh a lán daoine páirt inti. I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the House with regard to Ireland's national reform programme under the relaunched Lisbon Agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">In 2000, the then 15 member states set the ambitious objective of making the European Union by 2010 "the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, with more and better jobs and greater social inclusion". This goal was to be achieved by an extensive reform programme, including the establishment of an effective internal market, boosting research and development, and improving education. While much of the work involved in implementing the Lisbon Agenda appears complex, it is really about people's lives. It is about the bread and butter issues which are important for every citizen and every community, both here in Ireland and across the EU. They are bringing about tangible benefits in the daily lives of our citizens — supporting workers in their employment, assisting the business community in managing the transition to a knowledge-based economy, protecting our environment and promoting greater social cohesion. This is a challenging agenda. It is unique in that while it sets common goals and targets across member states, they can only be achieved by acting in partnership. European institutions, national governments and all stakeholders must therefore work together towards the common goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Under the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2004, a mid-term review of progress across the EU was initiated. This found that the overall results were disappointing. The outcome of the mid-term review acknowledged the scale of the challenge facing Europe, in particular the widening growth gap with other major world economies. Failure to address this gap would see Europe experience further economic decline, with inevitable pressure on its social and environmental policies. In this context, the European Council earlier this year agreed that the Lisbon Agenda would be relaunched as a partnership for growth and employment. It would focus particularly on two urgent priorities, growth and jobs. The overall process would be simplified and streamlined. Each member state would produce a three-year national reform programme setting out its national priorities and commitments to improve economic growth and create further employment. For its part, the EU Commission would focus on measures to be taken at EU level to reinforce the programmes being undertaken by member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">While the European Council agreed to focus on two urgent priorities of growth and employment, it also endorsed action in two complementary areas — promoting social cohesion and sustainable development. In terms of social cohesion, the Commission's communication on the social agenda addresses vital issues of tackling poverty and disadvantage. This social agenda will help achieve the Lisbon objectives of full employment and social cohesion. Likewise, the new focus on growth and employment expressly acknowledges the importance of the environment and overarching role of sustainable development. The declaration on guiding principles for sustainable development, which was adopted in June last, is a basis for achieving sustainable growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The member states and the Commission agreed on an integrated set of 24 broad guidelines to be considered during the preparation of the various national reform programmes. These guidelines, covering macro-economic policy, micro-economic policy and employment policy, replace the broad economic policy and employment guidelines which were previously reported on in two separate processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Ireland is fortunate in that, owing to the broad range of policies being pursued in recent years, we are performing well, according to many of the key economic indicators. Over the past ten years, GNP has increased at an annual average rate of 6.3%, and is forecast to continue to grow at close to 5% over the term of the national reform programme. Expressed <i>per capita</i>, our GNP has almost trebled since 1994. Government debt is down from close to 90% of GDP in 1994 to less than 30% in 2004. Unemployment has fallen from 14.7% in 1994 to 4.4% last year. The employment rate rose from 52.2% to 66.7% over the same period. Overall, we are making solid progress towards the Lisbon Agenda goals and starting from a relatively strong base with our new three-year reform programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Many factors have contributed to this strong performance. The programme for Government, agreed in 2002, provided the framework for action across the entire policy spectrum and is entirely consistent with the Lisbon Agenda. Two of the central pillars of the programme for Government are sustaining economic growth and maintaining full employment in the economy. To achieve this, the Government committed in its programme to maintain the public finances in a healthy condition and to keep down personal and business taxes in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy. Within these constraints, the Government reaffirmed its determination to concentrate the available resources on improving the quality of public services and delivering further real improvements to pensioners and people on low incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Underpinning these aims, we have a strong track record under our social partnership model of forging consensus with and among the social partners on the right measures to take. Over the past 18 years social partnership has provided us with a much needed framework to take corrective measures to address the problems of the mid-1980s and, since then, to build up and improve overall economic and social progress. Bringing together the various key sectors — employers and trade unions, the farming sector and the community and voluntary organisations — to work in partnership with Government has served this country well. It has helped to create the necessary conditions and consensus to give rise to growth, jobs and better social provision instead of rising taxation and spiralling debt. It has contributed to providing stability and certainty over a multi-annual timeframe and has unquestionably yielded significant benefits in terms of industrial peace. Not surprisingly, successive Governments have reaffirmed the centrality of social partnership to economic and social development.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">In the broader context, it is clear that the Lisbon Agenda is consistent with our own national goals and priorities. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that when the member states committed last year under Ireland's successful EU Presidency to create national reform programmes to engage more closely with the social partners, it was decided that our existing social partnership model would serve as Ireland's reform programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The current partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, runs to the end of 2005 and nobody underestimates the challenge of securing a new agreement. However, drawing on the experience of the past, we know we stand a better chance of tackling problems by working together. In some respects it might suit us better if the national reform programme did not have to be prepared for another few months. That said, we will update our Lisbon programme in the light of the outcome of future engagement with the social partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The Government is acutely aware of the need to maintain competitiveness and improve productivity, despite our recent impressive performance. No matter how successful we have been in recent years, we cannot simply rest on our laurels. We are fully committed to the important linkages between our economic performance and our social policy to achieve a fair, just and inclusive society. It is fitting, therefore, that the national reform programme gives us an opportunity to put together, in an integrated way, the policies and initiatives that are being implemented to ensure continued success.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I will outline the content of the programme in the areas of macroeconomics, microeconomics and employment guidelines and in line with the priorities which we have set. The range of structural reforms envisaged under the Lisbon reform programme must take place in a stable macroeconomic environment, with a particular commitment to sustainable public finances. As I have already outlined, our public finances remain in a good position. Nonetheless, we must remain alert to the risks to our economy, particularly the high level of oil prices. Our levels of competitiveness must be closely monitored and, in particular, the ongoing reliance on the construction sector for our current level of output. We must be sensitive to the potential impact of an eventual reduction in construction output levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">It is vital that Europe becomes more competitive, in its actions as well as its words. We must accept that the global picture is important, given that the EU now competes directly with other regions of the world for mobile investment in knowledge and research. Europe, therefore, must remain an attractive location for future global investment. Improving our competitiveness within the domestic economy and internationally is critical to Ireland's continuing success. By 2004, Irish income <i>per capita</i> had overtaken the EU 15 average, driven largely by increases in employment. In future, further improvements in living standards will depend less on increasing employment and more on increasing productivity. Ireland’s economic development strategy is now aimed at developing a more dynamic, enterprising and innovation-based economy. Our competitiveness will be enhanced over the period of this programme by the creation of an environment where enterprise can flourish and consumers are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Research and development is an area which can have a major impact but is one where we are still under-performing relative to international benchmarks. Consequently, continuing to increase research and development investment, capacity and output is a particular priority under this programme. Ireland's gross expenditure on research and development is approximately two thirds of the EU average, at 1.62% of gross national product for 2005. However, that is not to say that we have been ignoring research and development up to now. Government investment in research and development increased fivefold, from €500 million between 1994 and 1999, to €2.5 billion under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Several key steps have been taken to build further on this positive start. Earlier this year, the Government adopted a new national action plan for research and development and an interdepartmental committee is finalising a proposed implementation strategy, such as science and technology, energy, environment, marine and agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Strong foreign investment, exports and domestic demand have led to sustained reductions in unemployment over the past decade. A greater emphasis must be placed on productivity by encouraging greater levels of innovation and entrepreneurship across the enterprise sector. A range of key initiatives is under way to drive this development, drawing on the work of expert bodies such as the enterprise strategy group and the small business forum.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Ireland's level of public investment, at close to 5% of GNP, is among the highest in the EU and is approximately twice the Union average. Public investment under our national development plan is targeted at addressing the infrastructural deficit to improve the potential growth of the economy in the longer term. The Government is now in the process of setting out a new blueprint for investment for the seven-year period after the expiry of the current plan. The new national development plan will focus on priorities for investment in public, economic and social infrastructure in areas such as transport, environmental services, housing, education, health, child care and research and development. In particular, we will continue to build on the major investment that has been made in our transport infrastructure through the ten-year capital envelope for transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">We must ensure that where it is necessary to regulate, we do so in the best way and with proper consultation. The 2004 White Paper, Regulating Better, sets out the Government's approach to better regulation. Guidelines on consultation for public sector bodies were published in June of this year. The Government has established a group on better regulation to oversee the implementation of the commitments and action plan arising from the White Paper. In addition, the Government has introduced a policy of systematic regulatory impact analysis across all Departments and offices. In the business sector, a new business regulation forum has been set up to report to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on burdens imposed on business by outdated, inefficient or disproportionate regulation and to advise on business regulatory issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Economic progress and improving social inclusion and quality of life must go hand in hand. Ireland's strategic approach to social inclusion is set out in the Government's national anti-poverty strategy and the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion 2002 to 2005. Increasing access to employment has been a key part of Ireland's strategy to combat social exclusion and significant reductions in unemployment have contributed greatly to rising living standards. We must continue to facilitate participation in employment as a major strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Under the national reform programme, we will work to encourage the sustainable use of resources and strengthen the synergies between environmental protection and growth. Ireland is already well on track to meet the target under the EU renewable electricity directive for 13.2% of electricity to be generated from renewable sources. In addition, the decoupling of energy and emissions growth from economic growth began in 2002, with economic growth at 3.7% in 2003 and energy consumption remaining flat at 0.2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">Ireland has continued to achieve high levels of employment. Employment growth continued in the second quarter of 2005, with the number of jobs up by 93,000. This represents the largest annual rise in employment since 2000, with the number of persons in employment now at 1.929 million. The long-term unemployment rate remains extremely low, both by historical and international standards, at 1.4% or, in figures, 27,600.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">Under the national reform programme, we will ensure labour market policy contributes to making the economy more knowledge based and innovation driven. A wide range of initiatives are in operation, designed to prevent and counteract long-term unemployment. FÁS assists those who are longer than six months on the live register to gain employment, training or to enter active labour market programmes. Other initiatives are ongoing and are aimed at expanding the workforce and include lone parents and redundant workers. An independent review of the prevention and activation process is under way as well as an expenditure review of State supports for the long-term unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">In addition to these measures, we are committed to increasing investment in human capital through better education, skills and lifelong learning. Our national education policy aims to ensure that all young people leave the education system with a high quality education and with qualifications. A total of 85.3% of those aged between 20 and 24 years have completed upper secondary education and a majority of these go on to third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">To reach those at a disadvantage in society, the Department of Education and Science published a five-year action plan for educational inclusion, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, in May 2005. This plan will be implemented on a phased basis and will tackle literacy and numeracy as well as attendance issues, progression, retention and attainment. Early school leaving policies have been shown to have a positive impact, with a rate of only 12.9% of early school leavers in 2004. This is clear progress towards the EU average rate of 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Higher education has seen major expansion over the last two decades in terms of numbers and investment. This is reflected in an increased participation rate for school leavers of 55% in 2003 compared to 20% in 1980. A particular challenge is to upgrade the competencies and qualifications of the workforce, particularly those with low skill levels and in low level occupations. This challenge will be addressed through a range of initiatives, including implementation of the national framework for the development of lifelong learning, continued priorities in the implementation of this framework, including addressing skills needs and widening access to lifelong learning, tackling disadvantage and addressing access barriers.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Increased labour supply will be met from the underlying population increase, increased participation by the unemployed, access for those outside of the labour force and migration. We are experiencing a significant influx of workers from the new EU member states. The net inward migration figure for Ireland in the year to April 2005 was 53,400 people, of which over one third were nationals of the ten new member states. Legislation is being introduced by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to codify work permit arrangements, improve protections for migrant workers and allow for a new green card system.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">I am satisfied Ireland is unquestionably playing its part in helping the European Union as a whole to realise the goals of the Lisbon Agenda. It is appropriate that the relaunched agenda places greater emphasis on member states pursuing policies appropriate to national priorities and circumstances. That said, we must all work together to bring our Lisbon goals back into sight. Member states cannot just look over their shoulders at each other, but must look outwards. Globalisation is a fact of life and we must deal with it. The threat to Ireland, and Europe, is increasingly global, whether from the Americas, India, China or from other new tiger economies. Standing still is not an option, regardless of how well or badly we are doing. This goes back to the 1970s when former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, said standing still was not an option. We had no option but to join the then EEC and we are now members of a successful Union in which we played our part. The Government, as this new national reform programme demonstrates, is fully committed to working in partnership with other member states and the EU Commission, to ensure Europe's economic and social future, in the challenging and exciting years ahead.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_269">The Minister of State's remarks are helpful and interesting but we need to concentrate on the Lisbon Agenda as much from a European as an Irish perspective. Europe's problems are Ireland's problems and Europe's solutions are Ireland's solutions. We must work together on all the economic and social issues facing us, of which there are many.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">As the Minister of State said, the Lisbon Agenda was launched on the European stage in March 2000. At that stage it was considered a bold and brave statement on Europe's economic future. I am not sure the level of attention or debate it received in this country was adequate. When we switch on the debate about Europe at parliamentary level or in a wider context, we do not get much of a response. It is important that we try to disseminate to everybody involved in the political process and the wider public the importance of the ongoing debate, because no debate about Europe is more important than the one on future economic strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The declared aim of the Lisbon Agenda was to transform the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. It was an ambitious project because it was to be carried out with a ten-year programme. It mentioned, as the Minister of State did, sustainable economic growth with more and better paid jobs, better social cohesion and the highest possible level of environmental protection. It was a radical plan but its delivery has been much more modest.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I am disappointed there has been so little public debate in this country and throughout the European Union on the subject of the Lisbon Agenda. If we were to conduct a poll among the citizens of Ireland, the vast majority would not have heard of it, notwithstanding its importance for the economic and social life of every citizen in the European Union. Its proposals still can transform the lives and prospects of those citizens for the better. As everybody in the House knows, the domestic political debate in the next 12 to 18 months will focus on what policies the next Government will pursue and on the parties which will make up the next Government. If we were honest, we would concede that the debate about the future economic and social direction of the European Union will have a much greater impact on every Irish citizen than any domestic consideration. The economic and social trends will be set in the Union. Therefore, we must play a full role and involve every person in the debate. To date, we have failed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I was glad the Irish Presidency decided that a mid-term review of the progress of the Lisbon Agenda should be conducted. The expert group headed by the former Dutch Prime Minister, Mr. Wim Kok, was correct in concluding that not much progress had been made. The report indicated that the agenda should be refocused with particular emphasis on growth and employment. The new report is certainly more modest than the March 2000 programme but it will be of benefit if there is the political will to drive it forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">In Ireland and across the continent we must realise where the economy and that of the European Union are going. We know and can recite <i>ad nauseam</i> the story of the Celtic tiger and the great strides we have made. We would, however, be living in cloud cuckoo land if we believed the economy can continue to grow at a consistently higher rate than that of the European Union and avoid some of the pitfalls faced by our European neighbours. As the Minister of State said, the economy of the European Union cannot stand still. It will either move backwards or forwards. If it moves backwards, all of Europe’s citizens, be they from Dingle or Dussledorf, Mallow or Madrid, will suffer pain. We cannot ignore the fact that the current performance of the wider European economy is simply not good enough. The Minister of State mentioned the steady Irish growth rate but we will pass or fail on the performance of the broader European economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Average growth in the Community is approximately 2% per annum, little more than half the rate in the United States. In China the current growth rate is 8% as the whole south-east Asian economy continues to boom. Unemployment figures across the European Union average almost 10%, almost twice that of the United States. The profile of our workforce is elderly and older people with skills are leaving the workforce. Americans often refer to "old Europe", which is sometimes seen as a political jibe by so-called "neocons" in the United States. When they speak about "old Europe", they are not just talking about politics but the fact that, demographically, the workforce in Europe is literally growing old. It is aging. The population is falling and there is a low birth rate, creating a major problem for the funding of pension entitlements and social security programmes. This is an issue we must tackle head on. We cannot afford to wait any longer. In that regard, the focus on economic growth and employment creation must be maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">There is no secret as to why the economy has thrived since the mid to late 1980s. Social partnership has worked well and taxes have been lowered, giving employers the incentive to create jobs and employees the incentive to take up work. There has been an easing of bureaucracy and, to some degree, regulation. This agenda has also worked well in countries that have followed the same formula. Unfortunately, in other European countries economic and political change has been less radical and the necessary adjustments to allow the European Union to compete against the United States and south-east Asia have not been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">I accept that economic and social change is painful but we also have to recognise that without the necessary changes, there will be no guarantee of the European Union remaining a prosperous economic zone. Some will argue that it is not all about economics and they are correct, yet without economic growth and development, we will not have the jobs to employ our young people or the taxes to provide social services and pension entitlements. We must, therefore, keep the idea of economic reform, greater flexibility, lower taxation and regulatory reform to the fore of a European strategy. In this country we have made great progress in that regard but we cannot stand alone. Our adoption of such progressive measures has served us well but in the long run we must ensure it happens all across the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I will refer to two issues which cast doubt on the Government's ability to improve competitiveness and enhance basic infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The Minister of State referred to competitiveness. The country has slipped from fourth place in 2000 to 30th in 2005 in the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness report, a steep fall. Such a fall is mainly a result of the Government's failure to control prices. A debate occurred during the summer, stimulated by a television programme, about rip-off Ireland. There is a general acceptance that there was a failure to check massive price rises across various sectors. It is crucial that the Government responds in a meaningful fashion to the issue of increased costs, be they in local shops, raw materials or production. The cost base should be examined as the country must remain competitive. The country is living on the edge with regard to competition, and perhaps it has been comfortably coasting along for the past few years. A further loss of competitiveness will bring a loss of jobs across the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I welcome the Minister of State's remarks about the need to be very sensitive about the potential impact of an eventual reduction in construction output levels. That issue should be addressed as we know such an occurrence will come about. It is not a political point. The current rate of construction of new houses in the country, even taking a mathematical perspective, cannot continue indefinitely. Hundreds of thousands of people are employed in the construction industry, and we should be ready to deal with the consequences for jobs as the current rate of construction cannot go on indefinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Another vital infrastructural issue is technology. I bring to the attention of the Minister of State a report stating that Ireland is 14th in a table of 15 countries with regard to broadband penetration. The survey was carried out by the European Competitive Telecommunications Association. Ireland has only 64,000 broadband lines, whereas Denmark — a country of similar size — has 839,000 broadband lines, a large multiple of the Irish number. This is unacceptable and the issue should be addressed by the Government. We cannot allow the country to be bottom of the class in the broadband school.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">This leads to the education issue, particularly educational disadvantage. This issue must be addressed as part of the national reform programme and Lisbon Agenda across the Continent. In Ireland we must examine carefully educational progress. We all acknowledge that the introduction of free education in the late 1960s was not merely a major social step forward, but arguably the most important economic decision ever made by a Government. The rainbow coalition Government's decision in 1995 to pay college fees for the vast majority of students followed on from this and completed the broadest possible opening of the education door. However, challenges are now to be faced in the sector and unless they are tackled, the country's youth could fall behind their European colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I draw the Minister of State's attention to recent figures which show a drop in school retention rates. In some schools, a drop-out rate of up to 60% exists. Under the Lisbon Agenda we gave a clear commitment to increase the number of pupils finishing their schooling but we have failed on that front, and the Government has not matched its aspiration. For example, more than 1,000 children are not even making the transition from primary to secondary school, a very disappointing fact and a dreadful mark of failure. Although we speak of the Celtic tiger economy some children's education ends at 12 years of age. For more children, education finishes at 15 or 16 years of age. The gateway to the future is being shut for those young people. It is politically, socially and morally unacceptable, and the Government should be given a low mark for its efforts on the issue. Much more must be done, as education will play a key role in the ongoing economic and social development of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">As my time is nearly concluded, I thank the Minister of State for his presentation. This debate should be kept to the fore. The Lisbon Agenda, more modestly called the national reform programme, is at the centre of where Ireland and the European Union are going. We should be proud of where Europe has come from, with peace and democracy being spread across the Continent. The process has been an amazing success, and the European bloc is a fine solid economic unit. We must not rest on our laurels. Europe cannot stand still as countries such as the United State, China and India, as well as the south-east Asia region, are not standing still.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">There are tough decisions to be made and it is in all our interests that we participate in debating and making these decisions. I look forward to an ongoing debate. I suggest that in the Seanad in particular, where we refrain from tossing political charges as often as in the other House, the debate should be kept open-ended, and a regular review of the progress of the agenda should occur.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_286">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House. I wished to be present when he entered the House but I was unable to do so. I listened carefully when he spoke in the Dáil on the Lisbon Agenda, or the national reform programme as we call it.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">When the Lisbon Agenda was published in 2000, everybody labelled it as radical and interesting and as something that would do much good for Europe. The process has clearly slowed in other European countries, although not here. I will not boast about Ireland, but it is amazing how much the national reform programme mirrors what was detailed in the Lisbon Agenda, or what is now the Lisbon National Reform Programme. The programme contains many guidelines that this country has operated under for approximately the past decade. Although we may be tired of hearing it, people often ask how Ireland is in such good shape, with sustained growth beginning around 1994, sustained employment levels, and a sustained downward trend in unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">There have been some bad elements also, and Senator Bradford is correct in pointing out the lack of penetration for broadband, which is quite amazing. The Internet penetration issue may have been slightly better when I was Minister for Public Enterprise. We have never achieved a breakthrough, although I do not know why. The technology is being implemented throughout the country, the roads have lines running along them, people have had lessons and money has been given towards small and large grants. We are all now computer literate, but people may still prefer to do business on a personal level. This may contribute to this lack of penetration, as the lack is not down to an absence of providing the technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Even where penetration exists, an accelerated take-up of the Internet is not occurring. Perhaps people are wise to it and will not go along the route of constantly relying on technology when people skills are our main stock and trade. Such a hypothesis could be considered the reason for the low penetration and take-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The programme is laid out somewhat like a budget for a country or how one might lay out a growth pattern. The Minister of State's presentation was quite good, and the Department of the Taoiseach has outlined headings, such as research and development, of what the country hopes to achieve. We cannot emphasise enough the necessity to focus on and finance education.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The regional technical colleges were established many years ago when Dr. Hillery was Minister for Education. The money to build them came from the World Bank and as Members know, they were all built to a pattern. Subsequently they have all been enhanced through the addition of extensions or through reconstructions, etc. What would have happened had we had not moved ahead with the regional colleges at that time? Originally, there were to be eight colleges, but the former Deputy Neil Blaney secured one for Letterkenny and another college was established in Tralee. I remember the excitement in the town of Athlone when it was designated as a site for a regional college. They are now, rightly, called institutes of technology. When a definitive history of the growth in education in Ireland from that time comes to be written — I am sure some already have been — the institutes will play a pivotal role. They contribute to their surrounding regions and while many qualifications are the speciality of a particular college, they have achieved national standards of excellence.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Throughout our education system, we have established primary schools, all of which are good, as well as secondary, comprehensive, community and vocational schools to serve our young people. I share Senator Bradford's unease at the non-retention rate in second level schools, which is enormous. Many schools now have a teacher who is known as a retention officer. For example, in Moate Community School, which is a large school, there is a teacher whose duties include retention duties. This involves meeting parents and pupils constantly and encouraging them to stay put. While acknowledging there is a wider world in which such pupils may earn money, if the climate changes, they will no longer do so. They will be obliged to return to school.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">How often have Members met people who want to return to school? I meet such people constantly, including young women who left school to become waitresses, to work in shops or something else. They then decide they want to study for their leaving certificate examinations in subjects such as English, mathematics and history. They take subjects they perceive to be regular. I always encourage them and try to get them into a college or school which will be friendly towards returned students and which will provide an atmosphere where they will not feel out of place and will feel comfortable pursuing their further studies. Nevertheless, I do not like the increase in the non-retention rates of young people at second level schools. I expect the allure of earning money and of entering the marketplace is responsible. While there is big money to be earned, a student or young person entering the marketplace without a formal qualification such as a leaving certificate or whatever are at an enormous disadvantage, because it is a passport to better jobs and wages. Some young people do not even have junior certificates.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Eventually, such people may wish to enter a third level college. The third level colleges now run wonderful access programmes where people who left education early can return. In some cases their life experiences are rightly considered as if they were educational modules. Such people are able to develop a portfolio of credits based on experience and thus enter third level college. The significance of such programmes cannot be overstressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">When people ask me how Ireland maintained its success rate, growth rate and employment rate, I ascribe it to two factors. The first is education and the second is the development of the relationships between the trade unions and the other social partners. We have given various names to those consensus building arrangements. Historically, the premium on education was a major factor in Ireland when people had little else. I do not wish to sound trite when I refer to hedge schools, but it is true. Historical links endure in life. There was a premium on education and parents did not care what it cost or how it was secured if they could get their children into proper schools. The idea that proper education is needed lingered in people's minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Moreover, unlike the United Kingdom, in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, we did not go down the primrose path of adopting experimental methods for primary and secondary schools which originated in the United States. We kept to proper education, whereby one was taught to read, write, multiply and do one's basic sums. As we did not have the money to experiment, we did not do so. We were correct because ultimately, it has been proven that formal education, delivered now in happier milieus than heretofore, has served the nation well.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">As for second level education, I have always thought that the English approach of specialising in three subjects after completing the equivalent of our junior certificate was incorrect because pupils only had specialised knowledge of those subjects. Irish pupils sample six or seven subjects and acquire a nodding acquaintance with many of them, including various languages. While one might not be proficient, one certainly has a good acquaintance with many subjects. It is daft to ask young people of 14 or 15 years of age to decide on their further careers when they have plenty of time to do so at 17 or 18. In addition, the world is not static. Nowadays, few people stay in the same jobs forever or retire from them. People's minds are now required to be versatile. They are required to think laterally as well as vertically. People must be open-minded and lateral thinkers so they are available, ready and willing to change jobs and move about.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">This is a strong point in our favour and cannot be emphasised enough. All Governments, no matter how straitened they were for money, provided rich and robust education budgets. This was the case when I shadowed the then Minister for Education, Gemma Hussey, even though money was then very tight. Naturally, I claimed it was not.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">The education budget was maintained in bad times and good, because the people were willing to give up their taxation to education. I have never known a Minister for Education who did not fight like a tiger for his or her money and get a fair amount. All Governments paid great credence to education and put great faith in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The various arrangements under the first partnership agreement, the Programme for National Recovery, were agreed in 1988. While the programmes went through various colourful names and became more embellished as they went on, they were very good programmes. It was a major achievement that people in trade unions, agriculture, women's groups, etc., could come together and hammer out an agreement in which all promised and undertook to work well together.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">When I outline how it works to people, they ask if it means there are no strikes. As all Members know, it does not and when one considers the matter, that is correct. One cannot nullify and neuter all the trade unions and no one tried to do so. Nowadays, strikes are concerned with fair issues like better wages. I remember there were some strikes in CIE which concerned such issues. Iarnród Éireann relied too much on overtime and the workers did not receive a decent basic wage on a five day week. Consequently, the problem was worked on and was resolved satisfactorily.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Progress on renewing these arrangements is currently on hold. The Taoiseach has given reassurances to SIPTU, which constitutes 40% of the entire trade union movement's membership. SIPTU is rightly worried about a "race to the bottom", to use a recent phrase. It is worried about migrant labour and the displacement of jobs and employment. It has every right to be worried about these matters. Competitiveness is an enormously important part of the Lisbon Agenda. However, competitiveness does not or should not mean there is to be a scaling back of decent regard for workers or decent wages. I have never felt this was the kind of competitiveness that we should be engaging in or striving towards.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">When I was Minister for Public Enterprise, there was a huge emphasis in all the semi-State companies on trade unions. I always believed that, if one explained the circumstances, laid out one's stall and talked matters through, one could bring trade unions on board. I am a great believer in talking and engaging in discourse with people at various levels of employment. I hope that the assurances the Taoiseach will provide to SIPTU and the other unions will allay their fears about a new three-year programme. There is no doubt that many good activities will depend on having this arrangement in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">It has been 18 years since the partnership process started and people ask whether it is time to have an open marketplace. We should wait to determine what it will be like. Be it red clawed socialism or something else, the consensus arrangements cannot be beaten if they can be worked through. Mr. Jack O'Connor has been entirely fair in this matter and has warned the trade unions that they must get a proper——</p>

          <p eId="para_311">There were many other issues I wished to discuss but one speaks about what one knows best. I thank the Minister of State. It is good that we will have a staging post for the Lisbon Agenda. The mid-term review occurred under the Irish Presidency of the EU, which led to this. This in turn will determine what we will do for the next number of years until a further review.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The Lisbon Agenda was far-reaching, innovative and radical when it was formulated but we have all moved on and it now seems reasonably ordinary. It is worth examining what has happened to other countries. Germany lost itself in a sea of directives, half of which there was no need to be involved in. I have always been amused that countries rushed to adopt EU directives but never implemented them. I am not speaking about Germany but countries such as Spain and Greece, which stayed clear of implementing them. The Minister of State will have encountered this. We have been too eager in adopting the directives in their wildest forms.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I am not taken in by President Barroso's burning of 70 directives. I do not know whether they were old or new directives but he burned them in a macho theatrical show to state that was what he was going to do in the EU. The formulation of the directives should be thorough and painstaking. If there is no need for it, do not do it. I thank the Acting Chairman as he has been very lenient regarding my time.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_314">I welcome the Minister of State and his statement. We are discussing the national reform programme of the Lisbon Agenda and the Minister of State has explained very well what Ireland is doing. We have been told to take on board and adhere to this three year programme but it gives me no pleasure at all to say that the Lisbon Agenda is, to all intents and purposes, a dead duck. I say this with the greatest regret as I have been one of the agenda's champions from the very beginning. I loved the terms it uses, such as "knowledge-based economy" and "competitive area of the world by 2010". I welcomed it because it offered the EU as a unit a position in the world that had nothing to do with throwing its weight around. I have always resisted the idea that we should become another world power or a counterweight to the United States of America. For me, the mission of the EU is to be a peaceful trader. If we excel in this respect and become the most competitive area in the world, so much the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I also welcomed the priorities of the Irish Presidency in 2004 when it sought to revive the Lisbon Agenda and put it on the front burner again but we saw all too clearly that our attempts met with meagre results, which I say with a certain sense of sadness. We should recognise that the agenda is a dead duck for all practical purposes due to a number of reasons. First and most obvious, the results achieved. Instead of closing the gap with the US since launching the initiative, we in the EU have done the very opposite. In all of the benchmarks that matter, whether they are in productivity, spending on research and development or, as Senator Bradford mentioned, the penetration of broadband, the gap between the EU and the US is getting wider every day. We are living in cloud cuckoo land if we believe we can even close it by 2010. There is no point in setting ourselves a target that is clearly unattainable. It would be better to be realistic and come to this conclusion. I am speaking about Europe as a whole and will return to the difference between the EU and its 25 member states later.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">One of the reasons we have failed to close the gap is that we lack the mechanics to do so. This was a European initiative but was never within the competence of the European institutions we established to make it happen. All Brussels could do was exhort, encourage and push the member states to do what was needed. It was clear from the beginning that any action on the Lisbon Agenda must be taken by individual states. Despite all of the huffing and puffing, they have singularly failed to do so. The truth is that while the Lisbon Agenda was a priority for the Commission, it was never a priority for the larger European states. They must take the hard decisions to make the agenda work but, almost without exception, they have lacked the motivation to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">Taking Dr. T. K. Whitaker in 1959 as an example, the Government faced a number of tough decisions. We had grown used to a way of life that worked reasonably well for us in the 1930s and 1940s in terms of what we wanted to achieve but when Dr. Whitaker put forward an economic plan in 1959 it took courage to tell people something difficult needed to be done and that we needed to do away with protectionism. These are the same types of decisions facing the larger member states but they have not faced up to them. Many of the larger states have more pressing domestic concerns to pay attention to instead of getting involved in making the reforms, which would be very unpopular in many cases. It is fair to say that when it was proposed to do away with car assembly activities here, there were howls of protest from the people whose jobs would be lost. Others are not facing up to the same problems we addressed in those years and this is why the gap is widening. No one in those countries is working hard to close it.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Another reason we have failed is the nature of Europe's economy. In comparing the amount that industry in Europe spends on research and development with the United States and others, the European figure is much lower. It is worth examining why this is the case. The reason is not, as many people believe, that European industrialists are more stuck in the mud than their American counterparts, although this may be part of the reason. If this were the problem, we could try to get them to do something about it. The reason is due to the nature of our economy. The vast bulk of the EU economy, especially in the larger member states, consists of low technology, traditional style industries where the scope for research and development is low when compared with the greater proportion of the US economy, which is centred around the high technology industries of the future, where research and development is the very life blood of activity. Taking the Continent as a whole and the larger countries in particular, Europe's real problem is that its industries are old-fashioned and its structures are out of date. These are survival issues and the EU should focus on dealing with them. Talking about leading the world in this context is simply absurd.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I have discussed the EU as a whole, a single, continental entity and what I said remains true for as long as we examine problems from that perspective. However, when we examine closely the countries that comprise the EU, we see a different story and one that is much more complicated. It is worth our while to examine this closer picture as, by doing so, we can find the right path for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">One of the great aspects of the European Union which is being threatened all the time is that lovely word "subsidiarity". When I heard it first, I was not quite sure what it meant and now believe we must protect it. It makes a great deal of sense to make decisions in certain areas at the top in Brussels. However, the answer to this problem lies in ensuring more decisions are made closer to home and the markets. The overall European economy is not doing well and the outlook remains bad for the foreseeable future. However, within Europe certain areas go against this trend and not all European countries are uncompetitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">In recent years Ireland's economic performance clearly outpaced the European average. Recently I visited two eastern European countries and South America. The regard with which Ireland and the economy are held makes one proud to be Irish. I recently watched a British television programme that was 30 years old. I was jolted to hear Irish jokes being told. I realised I had not heard that type of joke for ten or 15 years. Anti-Irish jokes are no longer told because we are so highly regarded. I state this with a great sense of pride. Hearing the jokes reminded me how out of date they were.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">In recent years Ireland's economic performance has outpaced the European average and left all of the laggards behind. However, Ireland is far from being at the front of the pack. That is the main point I wish to make. Recently, we discussed the growth competitiveness index produced by the World Economic Forum. If one examines it, one sees the most competitive country in the world in 2005 is Finland which I got to know in 1971 and during the 1970s. I found its history, population and traditions had a great deal in common with those of Ireland. It has a large neighbour that ruled it for many years, influenced it and forced its language on it. At the same time as the Gaelic revival movement sought to ensure Ireland's independent culture in the 1890s, there was a similar movement in Finland.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Finland beat the United States into second place in the world competitiveness stakes. This is not a forecast for 2010, or any other time in the future. Finland is not only a European country, it is one with approximately the same population and many of the same traditions as Ireland. It is interesting to note Finland's performance is not a fluke. Which country is third on the competitiveness index? It is Finland's neighbour and a fellow EU member, Sweden. Which country is fourth? It is another small Scandinavian country, Denmark, which also has much in common with Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The Lisbon Agenda may be a dead duck as far as Europe as a whole is concerned. Some EU members are clearly acting in a successful manner. Three of our fellow members, two as small as Ireland, are already in the top four most competitive countries in the world. Where do we come on that scale? We are way down the list at No. 26. Taking the 15 EU member states before the recent enlargement, we rank tenth. While our growth rate is above the EU average, our competitiveness performance is certainly not. What I am saying is simple. We need to pay less attention to Europe as a whole, which is why I am excited about maintaining and protecting subsidiarity and ensuring it is not allowed to slip. More attention must be paid to those fellow members which are getting it right in the competitiveness race. We need to lift our eyes to the Nordic region where Finland, Sweden and Denmark have much to teach us. We can also learn from Norway which came ninth in the competitiveness index and it is not even a EU member state.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Examining the Government's reform programme that is the subject of this debate, I see a great deal of motherhood and apple pie, an all-American phrase which means one makes nice statements with which no one can disagree. Much of this document smacks of a desire to fill in the boxes for Brussels, rather than a determination on our part to get to the heart of the real challenges that face us. Rather than go into play with a huge shopping list such as the one before us, it seems we are not paying enough attention to two main priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">It was interesting to hear the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, discuss education. I spoke to a university professor during the week. He told me that when he started lecturing three or four years ago, he was jolted by the poor standards of undergraduate students in mathematics and basic English. He could not believe their inability to communicate in a written form or handle basic mathematics. Education is the foundation for the creation of future prosperity. If we spent half of the effort and money on education that we invest in roads, we would go a long way to transforming the country in the way necessary. All of the Nordic countries have a superb education system which produces great results for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">We also fail to focus on the information society, although there are exceptions. I raised this issue last week. I spoke on the Order of Business and three or four minutes later I received a text message congratulating me on the tie I wore that day, which was similar to the Cathaoirleach's. I looked around to see if the person who had texted me was sitting in the Visitors Gallery. He was in Melbourne, Australia watching what was happening on the Internet. He must have had little to do. He is an Irish man living in Melbourne.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">We have this ability. However, I am critical about what has happened to our position in the information society, the context in which we hope to compete in the future, the knowledge-based economy to which we referred in the Lisbon Agenda. We are failing to reach out to grasp the opportunities it provides. Nothing captures our attitude and failure in this regard more than our miserable standing on the key issue of bringing affordable broadband services to the mass of the people. Senator Bradford also referred to this issue. The Nordic countries excel at this and have embraced the information society superbly. They are countries the size of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">To sum up what I have to say, we should follow the winners and do what they do. Some of those winners are the same size as Ireland. The lessons they offer us are clear. We have only to listen to what they say and follow in their footsteps. I was a rugby player at school in Newbridge and our trainer was Fr. Hegarty. On one occasion he discussed the attacking and defending teams. I interrupted to ask him whether the attacking team referred to where one was standing on the pitch. He thought for one moment and answered that it did not. It depended on who was in possession of the ball. If one is in possession of the ball, even on one's own back line, one is on the attacking team. Europe and subsidiarity, if we defend it, can give us possession of the ball. What we do with it is in our own hands. We can achieve. If we have the ability, we must focus on achieving what we set out to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_333">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. I was a humble member of the delegation at the time the Lisbon Agenda was adopted. Arguably it was over-ambitious, given the starting point, to aspire to making the European Union the most competitive economy. It had the ring of a grand-sounding political target. The problems in some of the larger countries which have not yet been resolved make it difficult to achieve. I see signs of hope in Germany. I have great hopes that——</p>

          <p eId="para_336">Senator Bradford said we do not hear much about the Lisbon Agenda here and this is true partly because it has not posed the same challenges to Ireland as it did to other economies. It has not required us to take the difficult decisions that have caused disquiet in countries such as France and Germany. In recent months — and this is the reason for the pause in the social partnership negotiations — there has been concern about an outflow of jobs. We are still experiencing a considerable net increase in jobs but have lost certain, mostly low skilled, manufacturing jobs to eastern Europe and had a debate on employment conditions and the "race to the bottom". The Lisbon Agenda was inspired to a degree by the then Portuguese Prime Minister Barosso, who has since become European Commission President. Much of this is a political problem. It is not a technical economic reform issue about what countries should do. It is about persuading people to come with one and the economic advantages of so doing. We have gone through this process twice. Senator Quinn mentioned the Whitaker report of 1958. The process was repeated a generation later in 1987. I have been following the various competitive indices for at least 15 years, and I used to order them from the Department of Finance. They all come to totally different conclusions and I would not have an exaggerated respect for them.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">The basic statistics for the Irish economy are incredibly strong. Ireland has the lowest unemployment level in Europe at 4.4% and the second lowest debt level at 29.4%. The briefing notes of the national reform programme indicate where Ireland stands in terms of income <i>per capita</i>. We are not the second wealthiest country in Europe. Our GNP<i> per capita</i> is 106% of the EU average. That is a good position to be in but it is not 120% or 130% as is sometimes maintained when people confuse wealth and income.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">There are certain newspaper groups that do not like social partnership and who miss no opportunity to knock it and say it is no longer needed. This is nonsense.</p>

We also need crisis management mechanisms to deal with issues that regularly crop up causing severe problems. There are no disputes over whether people should talk to Government; the access mechanisms are there. At the beginning of most partnership negotiations there is an initial stand-off and apparent doubt about the outcome and that is understandable as part of the pre-mating routine.</p>

          <p eId="para_343">The benefit is overwhelming. At 5% of GNP, our current level of investment is making a real impact countrywide. There is more to be done and while I cannot detail the different projects now, I look forward to the ten-year transport infrastructure programme. Our employment rate is approaching 2 million, compared to approximately 1,080,000 in the mid-1980s. I hope that by 2007 we will be able to say that we have doubled employment. The Minister will remember there was a Government back in those days that doubled the national debt. It would be nice to be able to say we doubled employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Our Leader referred to education. There is a wide gap in our education infrastructure in the south east. We need a university in Waterford. Some of the arguments against it, which may come from competitors in other regions, do not hold water. The south east now has the second lowest income in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Reference was made to North-South economic co-operation. The Minister for Finance is in the North today. That is very important. Yesterday Mr. Peter Hain announced a significant development, which would be unwelcome to the business community — a 19% rise in rates. The clear message behind this is that the different parties must get their acts together and put together a devolved government, that they should not expect the British taxpayer to subsidise political difference and stand off but will support parties that are working together. It is a clear warning shot and has not come before time.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">One criterion of the Lisbon Agenda is that we should act in a way that supports economic and monetary union and the euro. We have done that in a model fashion. We are a small country and one could argue that by ourselves we could not create any great strain. In fact we have not created any strain but eased it. Senator Quinn is right to say there is considerable difference in performance between the countries of Europe. I do not want to sound overly complacent — we have many problems and challenges that we must confront — but nobody can deny we have been making substantial, rapid progress. If other countries made the same progress at the same rate maybe Europe would be closer to achieving the overarching Lisbon Agenda objectives.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_347">I welcome the Minister. Senator Quinn summarised the Lisbon Agenda wonderfully when he said it was "motherhood and apple pie". It has always been that and in a sense it was designed to be that way. It was put together at a Council of the European Union comprising prime ministers of so many different political hues that to get them to agree to anything was difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">We ended up with a faintly compromised formula which, on the one hand, talks about employment, growth, competitiveness and so forth and, on the other, genuflects to the left by reference to maintaining social provision, increasing job protection and so forth. If that was not sufficiently compromised, a couple of years later in Stockholm the concept of environmental sustainability was added to the pot. We are left with a formula which, frankly, means either nothing or everything. What it means varies according to who one talks to or the perspective of the individual or government. All in all, it has not worked or brought about appreciable improvement in the economic performance of EU states. It has not secured improved social provision throughout the eurozone, the EU or the new member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The Government attempted during the Presidency last year to refocus the agenda, particularly on the issues of employment and growth. By and large, I agree with that. I accept the general proposition that one cannot have social provision if one does not have employment and growth. To that extent, therefore, prioritising employment and growth is good and healthy. Whether that will translate into meaningful policy agendas is a different matter. The Minister of State's relatively short speech today covered an astonishing menu of issues. That is positive proof of how broad the agenda can be if one wishes to make it so.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">An interesting and useful spin-off of Lisbon has been the debate we have had in the past couple of years, generated in part by economic problems in France and Germany, about the European model, particularly the European social model. I read an interesting report earlier this summer by André Sapir, a member of a think tank in Brussels who, among others, is an adviser to the Commission on these issues. He produced a report to the ECOFIN in Manchester in June which has now become the consensus within the European Union and which states, in effect, that there is more than one European model.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">That is hardly a surprise. There are three or four identifiable, separate models. Sapir pointed to the old Franco-German, so-called continental model where there are high levels of job protection matched with high levels of social provision, such as unemployment benefit, retirement benefit, old age pension and so forth. In northern Europe and Scandinavia, the countries Senator Quinn mentioned, there is, by and large, a lower level of job protection and more flexibility in the labour market but a higher level of social provision. If one loses one's job, therefore, one will get more unemployment benefit. In southern Europe, that is, Spain, Portugal and Greece, there is a low level of social provision. Unemployment benefit is relatively low and does not last long. These countries concentrate most of their social welfare provision on old age pensions. However, they still have a high level of inflexibility in terms of job protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Then there is the British and Irish model which is something of a mix. Welfare benefits are average. They are higher than in the United States but lower than in France or Germany. The level of job protection is also lower than in France and Germany but higher than in the United States. Mr. Sapir makes the point, and I am persuaded by it, that the determinant of high levels of employment is more the level of job protection than the level of unemployment benefit and benefits which sustain the labour market. To put it another way, flexibility in the labour market is more important in determining levels of employment than the level of social provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">It is an interesting conclusion and one that is gaining ground. To my surprise, and slight horror, I read that Commissioner McCreevy endorsed this notion last week in the IEA. I always get slightly queasy when I find myself in agreement with Mr. McCreevy. There is substantial merit in the conclusion and if there can be a level of consensus on it, it represents a way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">One must ask, however, what this means for Ireland, where there are two different and parallel systems. I am not sure how healthy that is. In the private sector a certain set of rules applies while in parts of the commercial public sector a wholly different set of rules applies. I refer, for example, to work practices. The day is long gone in most of the private sector where one could expect disturbance money for an improved system of IT or moving to improved offices. The day is also long gone where uncertified sick leave is seen as just another holiday or where one would expect to get paid overtime for filling in for a colleague who is out sick. There are occasions where such work practices are appropriate but there are plenty where they are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Unfortunately, however, that is not the case in parts of our commercial public sector. Perhaps it is appropriate that it should be said on this side of the House but these work practices are not sustainable in the long run. I support giving people good conditions of work and good basic pay but we cannot sustain the type of inflexible work practices which, frankly, ultimately cost us jobs. I will not be more specific than that but it is something that should be borne in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">The mantra in Europe ten or 12 years ago was that we had to get the Single Market in place and then implement the single currency and everything that went with it. We have been reasonably successful in getting the Single Market in place where goods are concerned but spectacularly unsuccessful, particularly in recent years, where services are concerned. The real problem that has arisen is due to expansion and the accession of the new member states, where product prices and wage levels are so different and where the threats and, presumably, the opportunities are much greater. That has slowed down the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">We saw it most recently in the famous case in Sweden with the Estonian builders. Frankly, it is easy to see both sides of the argument. It is good for consumers, who are paying the price of services, to have competition from the east which is based on lower wage rates. However, it was not good for local construction workers in Sweden. The same could conceivably be true in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I listened with interest to the debate about rip-off Ireland. On one level, it is very superficial. We talk as if prices exist in a vacuum. Prices are high, for example, in the tourist sector, because people are paid half decent wages. That is the major, although not the sole reason, prices are high. We cannot simply say we want lower prices but we still want bar, restaurant and hotel workers to be paid at a high level.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_360">We must get the balance right. We could start by having a decent, honest debate about it rather than suggesting rip-off Ireland is a phenomenon that exists purely on one side of the equation, as it were. With regard to free trade within Europe, we must complete the Single Market. Commissioner McCreevy should be supported in implementing the services directive but he must have due and proper regard, more than he has demonstrated so far, to maintaining decent standards of employment in the countries where services are being traded.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Let us not kid ourselves that this will do the job. Whereas it was fair enough to say 15 years ago that a Single Market and competition within Europe was sufficient, we must now look far beyond the boundaries of Europe. Much of our competition now and 15% of our manufactured goods imports come from China and India in the Far East. Are we ready for free trade with China and India? I am not an ideologue on these issues. I do not believe, as Commissioner McCreevy clearly does, that free trade is necessarily and always a good thing. If one opened the floodgates in the morning, one would flush out a huge number of Irish and European jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">This issue must be tackled sensitively. It will quite rightly take time. There are industries, for example, clothing manufacturing, where we simply cannot compete and those jobs and industries are now gone from our shores. However, we could lose far more of the Irish and European economies to China and India if we do not retain some protective measures between now and 30 or 40 years hence. <i>Festina lente </i>on this. It is all very well to claim free trade is good and these countries provide consumers as well as competition but we must be careful. Our primary duty must be to our own people.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I wish to express a view on some of the matters that arose during the debate, one of which is broadband. This touches on an interesting issue, that is, the role of competition in a very small economy such as Ireland. The issue is well pointed up, for example, in the area of electricity supply. We are being told by the electricity regulator, and one supposes by the Government, that in order to get the level of competition they deem desirable we must increase prices, both to consumers and to industry and business, in order bring in other players into the market to compete with ESB, which was doing quite a good job to start with.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">There is a somewhat similar aspect to the broadband argument. I acknowledge the argument about local loop unbundling and I am just about persuaded that Eircom should go that road,——</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_366">It should unbundle, get done with it and allow the competition, but I am not persuaded that even if this happens, all parts of County Galway or County Mayo will have broadband within a reasonable time.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">We need Government to take the lead here, to state that it regards this as a matter of licence and that it will simply trade the licence to provide broadband to the entire county of Mayo, or to most of Mayo, to a particular company which will tender for it. We need to go that route. We need to encourage competition between companies for that tender and part of the price will undoubtedly be paid by the users of the service although it is likely it will have to be subsidised by Government. There is a need for the Government to grasp the issue. We cannot wait for the market to deliver broadband because I do not think it will ever do so on the Erris peninsula. We just will not get broadband in the measure needed, as quickly as needed and as widespread as needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Tax is another issue to which I want to refer. I have long been a believer, as the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and as the Leas-Chathaoirleach will know, in harmonisation of tax but this is an argument that is becoming increasingly more urgent. Many more countries in Eastern Europe, the newly acceded states, have moved to a flat tax and l listened last night on the BBC to the Prime Minister of Estonia who made it quite clear that the notion of progressive taxation is a thing of the past to which he has no intention of returning. It is inevitable that this will become more common in existing member states of the European Union. The notion, as the House will be aware, famously surfaced briefly during the German election and, thankfully, has now gone away.</p>

          <p eId="para_374">I mention this because I am against the idea of flat tax. The only realistic way of doing it in a fashion, which is controllable or which makes sense, is by agreeing, first, that there must be a broad base of taxation throughout the European Union so that we all agree in principle we will tax corporation profits as well as taxing income and, second, that there is a minimum rate at which it will apply. I am not saying any more than that — that, in itself, would be a more than sufficiently radical notion to get us going — but we must intervene in that and our rigid adherence in this country to the notion that we will not allow any interference or harmonisation on tax will do us down sooner rather than later; it is a matter on which we need to keep an eye.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">The Lisbon Agenda started in 2000. The idea behind it was that by 2010 the Europe Union must be the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy. I began to think about that sentence, asked myself what it means and considered how we should go about that. The Lisbon Agenda was launched when there were 15 member states. I asked myself how could we achieve the above goal with 15 member states all of which have different philosophies, social thinking etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Then I discovered that the Lisbon Agenda would be reviewed. I did not give it any thought between 2000 and 2004 because it was not part of my thinking, but then it again came onto the agenda for discussion in 2004 under Ireland's Presidency, where it was felt the agenda had to be reviewed because of enlargement. I began to take stock then because I was spokesperson on European affairs, it was an interesting time for Ireland and the Taoiseach was then the President of the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Reforming the Lisbon Agenda on the basis that the EU now has 25 members with different social backgrounds is back on the agenda. The ten new members are coming out of times of political instability. They are only familiarising themselves with democracy, now they have this agenda, that Europe must achieve economic co-operation in order to achieve growth, prosperity and competitiveness. There is such a combination involved that I am not sure this will be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The White Paper is strong on the subsidiarity clause, which mentions that each country must go after its own achievements. I welcome that each country and national parliament must determine where they are as regards economic growth, prosperity, the competitive and social agenda etc. between now and 2010. I welcome the necessary review of how we go forward with this Lisbon Agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">We can only speak about Ireland. At the end of the day, people will want to know what at this point in time will make the quality of life better for the man in the street in securing good employment and achieving economic prosperity. That is the key to the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">No doubt there is a need for collective responsibility because we must take on the challenges of globalisation and the Lisbon Agenda is probably all about the following question — how do we face up to the globalisation of the Far-East, China and India, which are growing at such a rate and the need for these countries to combat their own poverty? There must be collective responsibility in Europe in order to take on that challenge. We must take on the challenge of the United States as well. There is, therefore, a gap and it was overly ambitious in 2000 to set these goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Having said that, Ireland is doing very well. We have sustained economic growth, competitiveness and practically full employment. The question is how we can sustain these to reach the goals set for 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I have departed from my speech and started to wander, which is perhaps the best way to approach these matters. We must put a few measures in place and I am glad this reform programme has identified priorities. The priorities are that we must maintain our competitiveness, keep national debt low, and keep our taxes low in order to enhance the activation of employment among the population. That is my philosophy.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">We also must recognise that Ireland has an aging population. I welcome the decision to set up the National Pensions Reserve Fund in 1999 to deal with that matter and to put in requirements so that there will be early retirement packages. That is important to allow for the mobility of workers. In addition, the decision to increase the age of retirement was also important. These are measures which now must be put in place for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I do not know what the new member states will do. They will have different ways of achieving their targets. It is at the end of the period that there must be collective responsibility when it comes to dealing with the Lisbon Agenda and how we achieve it. One must not expect every member state's agenda to be the same. That is not possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">We also must look at how we manage our public expenditure and we have done so. I can only think of the examples of the overruns in the past on infrastructure projects. I am glad measures in that regard are being put in places. I suppose we can quote Mr. Eddie Hobbs and "seek better value for money" and provide for wage benchmarking to allow that any moderate increases in pay will be identified with productivity. We could talk around the clock on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Many Senators have pointed out that it is important we invest in education. We do pretty well in the area of education although there may be some gaps on which we could improve. Primary education is first class and second level education, despite the faults we find with the leaving certificate points system, is a good passport for any student to any part of the world. Students can use it as a passport for entry to universities in many of the member states of the European Union. Nobody should suggest that our leaving certificate is not a passport to a good third level education. Despite the points system, it provides a rounded second level education, unlike in some states where students have almost completed their education by the time they are 15 years old.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">We must put initiatives in place for the disadvantaged. The Minister of State must be aware of the need to fill the gaps. We have large drop-out numbers from education, particularly when students reach the age of 15 and think there are jobs for them, in particular in construction. They slip away from education because they want to make big money. It would be pity if we allowed this to continue to happen. FÁS must be part of whatever initiatives are put in place in this regard and must ensure these young people are drawn back into the education system. They may not want to do an academic leaving certificate programme but can do an applied leaving certificate programme. We should have more co-operation between FÁS and the education system to allow these students to continue their education. We must also provide lifelong learning programmes or second chance education for people who have fallen through the gaps in the education system between 15 and 18 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">We have four years to put these ideas and our new initiatives in place as part of the national reform programme, to ensure we become a knowledge-based economy and to ensure we have research and development programmes equal to the best in Europe. We have professional qualification programmes in place for this. Somebody suggested we open more universities. I am not convinced another university is the answer. Waterford Institute of Technology has excellent research and development programmes. I would like to see this acknowledged by making the Waterford institute a key area for research and development, rather than by making the WIT a full-blown university. That is the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">We have everything going for us here with regard to getting it right. Although there have been some mistakes, we are a model economy. Many of the member states of the European Union see us as a success story. Let us not constantly knock ourselves but consider how we can improve. When we get to 2010, let us be among the best. Let us combat globalisation and international crime and make a success of our economy so that we stand out then as one of the most successful economies of the world.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_394">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Treacy, to the House. He is well aware that we have many Ministers of State and that the numbers tend to grow each year. Some Ministers of State have responsibility for such areas as the OPW and Dublin traffic, all of which are neat, well-defined areas. Deputy Treacy seems to have responsibility for delivering the Lisbon Agenda.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">One of many.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_396">I congratulate him and wish him every success. Delivering the agenda is no mean feat for one man to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The idea that the Lisbon Agenda can be delivered across 25 different states, each with its own economy and level of modernisation, is daft. As a previous speaker said, much of the motivation behind this is politics. It tries to keep the impression abroad that the entity that is the European Union today, the 25 states, can deliver something, despite being in competition with the likes of Chinese, the Indian economies and others. I do not want to compete with those low wage economies, nor with many of the jobs on offer in the United States of America.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The political imperative for the leaders when they agreed this at the Lisbon summit was to ensure that we would have the most competitive economy in the world by 2010, etc. The idea that we can bring the levels of difference between all the economies of the Union together is daft. It is an aspiration we will find difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Many colleagues have asked how we have managed to gain our high employment levels over the past ten to 15 years. The answer is not a state secret. One, possibly the most important, ingredient was the low level of corporate taxation that existed for foreign multinational companies that wanted to invest here. We should not forget that America invests more in Europe than anywhere else in the world. While others in the European Union tut-tutted in our direction and lost many of those companies to us, we managed to gain a foothold and, as a result, built huge numbers in employment here from that source.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Another reason we succeeded was that we had a large, unemployed, well educated young population with low expectations. That has changed radically in recent years, because of high levels of employment among young people, something unique in Europe. Unemployment is a significant issue throughout Europe. The big problem among the new eastern European EU states is a high level of youth unemployment. One need only look at this problem in Poland to understand why so many of them are here doing jobs our young people will not do. They are here because the opportunities do not exist in Poland. They will travel the length and breadth of the Union to gain employment and language skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The English language, an international language, has been a significant factor in our economic success. Significant employment resulted from that on account of our large young population and our access as a bridge between America and mainland Europe. We must keep these facts in mind. Our economic model is, therefore, completely unlike that of other western European economies, for example, the French, German and British models which traditionally had a large concentration of manufacturing employment until the late 1970s. We never had a significant level of manufacturing industry, as was the case throughout western Europe, in particular France and Germany.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I agree with all Senator McDowell said on the issue of a flat rate tax. The notion that every taxpayer should pay the same percentage of his or her salary at one rate is regressive. I like the notion prevalent in many western countries that the more one earns, the more one pays. This is right in a progressive society. One can operate a flat rate tax in Slovenia, Slovakia, Lithuania and other countries which are virtually basket case economies. The introduction of a flat rate tax there might stimulate economic growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Another advantage of a flat rate tax is that it would eliminate overnight tax shelters and the like by which some people can hide their wealth. Nevertheless, I agree with Senator McDowell that the introduction of a flat tax regime throughout Europe runs contrary to notions of economic fairness and equality on which our tax system should be based. The idea of a flat tax rate was brilliantly employed by one of our political opponents at EU level in the recent German general election, but the political party in question now finds itself in government with its erstwhile opponents.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_405">Senator McDowell is more upset about it than I am. The EU Commission and the Council of Europe issue platitudinal statements on issues connected with the Lisbon Agenda but there is no level playing field in respect of the euro. One set of rules applies to small countries such as Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and some of the Nordic countries, which adhere strictly to the limitations on public expenditure. Another set of rules applies to France, Germany and Italy, which decide to ignore these limitations year after year. The fact that there is no mechanism to deal with this must be addressed. Perhaps it is not a drawback but we do not need to be lectured about our commitments to staying within the Stability and Growth Pact when others, particularly France and Germany, have shown scant regard for the kind of limitations on expenditure that are regularly brought to our attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Reference was made to our economy's over-reliance on the growth in employment in the construction industry in recent years. The notion that this high level of employability in the construction industry can continue is not sustainable. We will not be able to build, on average, 50,000 to 60,000 new houses a year for the next 12 years. We face enormous challenges in terms of creating a much wider and more diverse range of employment options within our economy. We are far too reliant on jobs in the construction industry. A small increase in interest rates would have a devastating effect on house building and the levels of new jobs in the construction industry would also be affected. The Government should realise that we cannot not allow the construction industry to act as the mainstay of new jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Despite the economic success of recent years, we face problems. Senator Ormonde has spoken about the problems facing people who are returning to education. We do not support people who leave school at the age of 18, go into full-time employment and cannot find either the financial incentive or opportunity to return to full or part-time education. The amount of money Ireland plc gives to each person between the ages of 18 and 21 on a full-time educational course is vast. I understand the figure was approximately €45,000 per student per year even before the introduction of free fees, which represents a massive investment. However, there are no opportunities for a person who began working at the age of 18 or 19 and who now wishes to return to formal education at the age of, say, 26. Neither the State nor his or her company will support it. The Government should consider introducing an educational credit. This would involve giving every citizen a certain amount of money to spend on education at some point in their lives. It is more flexible than giving all the opportunity to people in the formal education sector up to the ages of 20 or 21.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">We will face an enormous competitive disadvantage over the next three years. The Minister of State is aware that the British Prime Minister and eminent socialist, Tony Blair, has abolished free fees and introduced top-up grants, which will apply throughout the UK and will have an impact next year on Northern Ireland. For the first time in many years, many third level institutions there will have a considerable competitive advantage over our institutions because they will have additional money generated from top-up fees. I understand that this additional money will be used for research, technology and investment that our institutions will not have because the amount of money we spend in terms of investment and research in third level institutions is paltry compared to that in other EU countries. Over the next number of years, colleges in Northern Ireland will be out of the stratosphere with regard to additional funding opportunities brought about by the new system. We need to invest more in our third level sector to ensure the success of the technology and knowledge-based sector. I wish the Minister of State every success with regard to his very simple objectives.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DonLydon" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Mr. Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_409">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend him on his work in European affairs. I welcome this opportunity to consider the Lisbon national reform programme. It is difficult to overemphasise the importance of the success of the Lisbon process, particularly during the period of reflection on the future of Europe during which questions have and will be asked about the direction of Europe. The success of the European project has and will be grounded in economic success. However, the citizens of EU member states cannot be expected to be taken on the European journey without being informed of the destination and itinerary. It is, therefore, appropriate that we consider the national response to the Lisbon initiative here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The European Union faces two over-riding economic and social challenges in forthcoming decades. The first challenge lies in Europe's lack of competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> the US and the emerging economies of the Far East, while the second challenge lies in the aging profile of Europe’s population. Something must be done about the fact that we are not replacing ourselves. In response to these challenges, the EU Heads of State and the Government decided at the meeting of the Council of Europe in Lisbon in 2000 to make Europe “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion”. A subsequent Council meeting in Gothenburg subsequently added the concept of environmental sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, a sub-committee of which considers European legislation. This sub-committee considered the recommendations of the Commission in respect of employment policies — COM (2004) 239 and COM (2005) 141. These recommendations follow from the Lisbon initiative. The Joint Committee on European Affairs has also considered this matter which clearly outlines the issues at stake. The Lisbon Agenda is a wide-ranging set of policies which reaches into all aspects of the European economy and much of society. It covers areas such as the information society; policies in respect of enterprise, innovation and research; the Single Market; education; employment; social protection; social inclusion; the environment and macro-economic policies. Its implementation will take place through a mixture of European and national policies, not on the basis of legislation and sanctions but on a range of commonly agreed targets and benchmarking among member states which is known as the open method of co-ordination. It is now widely believed that the range of initiatives which began in 2000 have not made the progress that might have been expected across Europe and that commitments made by some member states have not been delivered. Ireland has a very positive record that is regarded as a model in some respects for other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Some speakers have mentioned that when they travel abroad, they are asked how Ireland has done it. The features of the Irish model include high levels of sustained economic growth, relatively low inflation and high levels of employment. Each EU member state needs to decide for itself how it can strike the right balance of measures to address its particular challenges. There is no single template that is ideally suited to all member states. There is no template for economic success. Therefore, the Lisbon approach which involves putting in place national reform programmes is the right one.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The Taoiseach has identified competitiveness, more and better employment, sound economic policies and sustainable growth as the four elements of economic success. If we increase the resources being allocated for research and development, we will take a significant step towards achieving further success in these areas. The EU Commission has proposed an ambitious expansion in this regard in its package for the seventh framework programme. It is regrettable, however, that the programme has not placed a greater emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises which will be one of the innovative motors in driving the Lisbon process forward. The Commission has asked member states to focus on economic reforms and to invest in the realisation of a knowledge society, based on human capital, education, research and innovation. As many Senators said, Ireland has made very good progress in reaching the goals set. The Lisbon programme of national reform will drive this success even further.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_421">Mr. Forde served briefly as the interim Prime Minister of Australia for one week in 1945, following the death of his predecessor, Mr. John Curtin. Despite the fact that Mr. Forde came from County Leitrim, he was not re-elected as Prime Minister because he did not get enough votes, as the late Mr. Frank Cluskey would have said. He went on to serve as an ambassador for Australia during his distinguished political and diplomatic career. I am particularly pleased that our friends from Australia are here for my contribution. Their presence emphasises once again the strong link between Ireland and Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I have started my speech positively, although I had intended to commence on a negative note by saying the Lisbon reform programme has been a failure. If one remembers the discussions which took place when the programme was first mooted and the concepts which underpinned it at the time, one will recall that it was intended to put in place a ten-year plan to lift the European Union from its economic malaise and put it on the world stage as a region of strong competition, high employment and increased prosperity for all. That we are discussing a relaunched Lisbon Agenda tells its own story. While the Lisbon Agenda has been a failure since its establishment, the economy has been outstandingly successful during that time. I agree with Senator McDowell that the agenda has not worked because the differing social models throughout the European Union have led to a lack of consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Senator Quinn has mentioned that one no longer hears anti-Irish jokes in this part of the world. I am not sure whether people tell anti-Irish jokes in Australia — those who try to do so probably get punched in the face. The anti-Irish humour of English comedians was the bane of our lives for many years. Senator Quinn correctly states such jokes are no longer heard because it is now cool and sexy to be Irish. One cannot call the people of a country thick or stupid if that country is doing as well as Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">As a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I was present last week at a function at which an initiative being pursued by the Federation of Irish Societies, the umbrella body for Irish societies in England, and the Irish Embassy in London was launched. Members of the parliamentary UK Labour Party were invited to the function which was hosted by Lord Dubs, a Labour peer who is a vice-chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body to hear at first hand the concerns of the Irish community in Britain. The function was graced by the presence of the UK Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. JohnPrescott, who spoke about the various social models within the European Union. He said he had been present the previous week at a meeting in Brussels at which the matter was discussed. He said that when he mentioned the Anglo-Saxon social model at the meeting, one of his French colleagues asked whether France was included under that definition. He responded by saying he meant the British-Irish model. While Mr.Prescott's remark brought a wry smile to those in attendance, it had further significance for me as an Irish parliamentarian. Not only was it interesting that a UK Deputy Prime Minister attended an exclusively Irish function in the House of Commons to talk to the Irish community about Irish interests, it was also significant that Mr. Prescott put Ireland on an economic par with the United Kingdom. The significance of his remarks show how far we have come and was not lost on the Irish politicians present.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I am sure the Government has considered, in the context of the various social models found throughout the European Union, that the main reason the French and Dutch electorates voted against the proposed EU constitution was that they considered, in their own way, that their social model of protectionism and regulation was somehow under threat. They did not necessarily base their judgments on the wider European vision, or the sort of things about which we talk nobly inside and outside the House — being good Europeans and advancing the European agenda. They voted with their concerns about the money in their pockets and the bread on their tables in mind. All of us in Europe, not least Ireland, face a real challenge to ensure the debate on the proposed EU constitution is kept separate from such regional and local issues. We need to meet this challenge if the European Union is to make strong progress at a global level.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The economy is strong. I noted a significant comment in the Minister of State's excellent presentation. When civil servants prepare draft speeches, they sometimes fail to outline what they are thinking in stark terms. I accept that the Minister of State makes a strong input into his own speeches. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_427">Our levels of competitiveness must be closely monitored and, in particular, the ongoing reliance on the construction sector for our current level of output. We must be sensitive to the potential impact of an eventual reduction in construction output levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Some economic statistics released into the public domain last week clearly indicated this country's over-reliance — I use the word advisedly — on the construction sector. As Senator Brian Hayes said, we are in serious danger of seeing a significant reduction in employment levels and consumer spending, if not quite back to the bad old days, if we do not strengthen the other building blocks of our economic success, as outlined by the Minister of State in his presentation. The construction sector has traditionally been the engine room of this country's economy. It has always been the case, even in the bad times, that when the construction industry does well, the country does well. While I do not want to sound a note of warning, I have to state I am concerned about this country's economic outlook. I welcome the macro-economic and micro-economic guidelines in the Lisbon national reform programme for that reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The Minister of State also referred to productivity. We all know this country is losing its manufacturing base rapidly, a trend that is noticeable throughout Europe. We need to consider the number of jobs which continue to haemorrhage from this country's manufacturing sector, as well as the huge increase in the services sector, which is partly driven by migratory labour. I heard someone say on radio yesterday that we should thank God for migratory labour because we do not know what we would do if we did not have it. Who would run our hotels and our services sector in general? I am not an economist, but I know, just like everyone else, that that sector is driven by consumer demand. If people get a feeling that the sentiment is not with us and that there might be a need to put money aside for a rainy day, they will cut down on consumer spending, for example, on an extra meal a week or an extra weekend break. What impact this will have on our economy is not yet known.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The Minister of State said: "A greater emphasis must be placed on productivity by encouraging greater levels of innovation and entrepreneurship." While we all agree on that point, the Minister of State went on to say rather abstractedly: "A range of key initiatives is under way to drive this development." I do not believe any Government would have an answer to this. If the manufacturing base is moving to low-cost countries because we have a problem with competitiveness and wages and the cost of living are too high, no Government would last five minutes if it was to suggest it would dampen economic demand, increase taxes and try to smooth out the economy. Ireland cannot do this because it now has a deregulated economy. The thrust of Irish economic performance in the past ten years has been deregulation which has taken place across the economic field.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">All of us agree on that point. Senator McDowell went into some detail but did not want to discuss specific cases because we all knew what he was talking about. I would be the first to support the public sector. Like all Members, I have always believed in a strong, vibrant public sector. I have never taken the view that everything should be thrown to the private sector, particularly as I come from a rural area where there is a need for public service delivery. However, I suggest to the Minister of State that it is on the question of delivery of public services that the future prosperity of the country will lie. A key question in this regard is how efficiently the Government can deliver public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Some ten years ago, when I joined the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, Ms Eithne Fitzgerald was the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach responsible for it. I asked a question then that others and I have repeated since, namely, given that this is a Europe of prosperity and increased cohesion, with a free market and free movement of goods, services and people, why is it at least one third cheaper to buy a range of products in the United States that are generally available in this country and elsewhere in Europe? Nobody has adequately answered that question. I suggest it goes back to my original point on the lack of consensus on social models and the regulatory nature of the European business sector. Until we get these right, I and many others will continue to ask why it is cheaper to purchase goods across the consumer spectrum — compact disc players, DVD players and fashion items — in a country of 280 million people when the European Union is supposedly an unregulated free market of 400 million. I will leave the question open.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_437">I endorse the welcome of the House to the Australian delegation led by Senator Alan Ferguson. In particular, I acknowledge the presence of Senator Ursula Stephens, all the way from Wicklow. It is great to have the delegation present. We had a successful occasion yesterday and it is good to see the delegation members again.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I thank Senators for their contributions to an open, fair, frank and positive debate. There is consensus on the issue of Europe, the Lisbon Agenda and the national reform programme. While we may not see eye to eye on everything, there is broad consensus among us on the overall goals of the Lisbon Agenda and the particular priorities for Ireland. We are at an interesting time on the European journey. On the one hand, the results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands on the European constitution are evidence of the need to make the European Union more meaningful to its citizens — the man and woman on the street. On the other, the member states must work together to address the issue of globalisation. Failure to do so risks holding back or undermining economic and social progress in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">I would like to respond to some of the issues raised by various speakers. Several Senators referred to the level of public debate on the Lisbon Agenda. Part of the reason for the relaunched agenda is that it was seen as too remote from the man or woman on the street. Under the new arrangements, it is for each member state to promote and pursue its own policies aimed at growth and employment and to connect with its citizens. Few people know much about EU policies and the Lisbon Agenda but everyone understands the importance of economic growth and jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Reference was made to the issue of pensions. In recognition of the importance of the issue the national pensions reserve fund was established in 1999 by the current European Commissioner for the Internal Market, then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy. Some 1% of GNP will be allocated to the fund each year until at least 2055. The fund was worth over €13 billion in June and it cannot be drawn from before 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Many speakers referred to the construction sector and I agree with many of the points made. The indications are that housing demand will remain strong for a number of years. In addition, an extensive ten year programme of transport infrastructural investment will be launched shortly. Therefore, while it is right to be aware of the sensitivity of this sector, the indications are that we can manage it positively into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Many speakers referred to broadband. The Government is playing its part by investing heavily in metropolitan area networks, popularly known as MANs, and subsidising community broadband initiatives. Some €165 million is being invested in these programmes by the Government. Industry, in particular the telecommunications sector, needs to play its part by improving availability of broadband for consumers at affordable rates. In fact, this message is being clearly delivered by the Taoiseach at a telecoms conference today.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Reference was made to education and educational disadvantage. Earlier this year the Department of Education and Science launched a five-year action plan to ensure equality of opportunity for all, which has been the hallmark of the education system. A macro decision taken in the 1930s concerned the broad education Act of the time which was followed by the decision in the 1960s under the late Donogh O'Malley to ensure equality of opportunity for all. We are still pushing to improve opportunities at different levels for different segments of the population. Senator Brian Hayes made an important point on opportunities for those in their 20s, 30s or older to be allowed into the system and for incentives to be put in place for lifelong learning. The social partners attached importance to the issue of equality of opportunity for all which is one of the ten special initiatives in Sustaining Progress. Many specific actions and initiatives are being pursued by the Department of Education and Science to tackle the important issues in this regard. The indicators show we are making good progress but we will continue to work for improvements. Historically and by political performance, we all have a strong commitment. It is the will of the nation that Governments and parliamentarians continue to support and invest in education at all levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Several speakers referred to innovation, science and technology. A major part of the jigsaw for Ireland concerns increasing overall investment in science and technology, in particular research and development, a point on which many speakers agreed. To be fair, this view is shared by the Government and, for this reason, the national reform programme goes into much detail on the measures now being taken which will be supplemented by further measures under a strategic implementation plan being worked on by the relevant Departments and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Reference was made to FÁS. Its funding has been targeted away from the unemployed towards training for those in the workforce. As recognised in the European Commission's continuing vocational survey, Irish companies devote considerable resources to employee training compared to many other member states. The report of the enterprise strategy group stressed the importance of further increasing workforce education and skill levels. A substantial increase in funding of some €36 million was provided for FÁS this year for the expansion of training programmes for people in employment, including basic workforce education. A significant part of this funding has been absorbed through existing FÁS measures. In addition, training has been provided through projects, managed by private organisations on a contract basis. This training will cover basic skills provision, occupation-specific upskilling, functional and general management training and entrepreneurial developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The World Economic Forum's growth competitiveness index showed Ireland moving from 30th position in 2004 to 26th in 2005. In its 2005 competitiveness report, the forum has developed a new measure of competitiveness across a more complex range of indicators, known as the global competitiveness index. On this index, Ireland is placed 21st overall. The top four in the index are the US, Finland, Denmark and Switzerland. A large factor in the determination of our position on these indices lies with our research and development performance, where it is acknowledged we need to do better. However, much work has been done to address this at many levels. In contrast, Ireland scores highly on the macro-economic indicators and the quality of public institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The Government is committed to taking macro-decisions, as far as is possible, on an all-island basis. Specifically in the case of preparing national reform programmes, the British and Irish Governments agreed to make a common contribution on North-South co-operation. This important development in Annexe III of our programme commits the two Governments to work together to identify areas for co-operation, to develop joint approaches on particular issues, and to learn from their respective experiences. The Government is working closely on both a North-South and East-West basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The relaunched Lisbon Agenda strikes a good balance between mapping out the overall goals and, at the same time, letting each member state decide on the policies and measures appropriate for its own particular circumstances. This is welcome, provided that each member state selects and implements policies which foster and underpin economic growth, create more jobs and, ultimately, contribute to a richer quality of life for all citizens of Europe. The emphasis on jobs and growth is not, by any means, to the exclusion of sustainable development or social inclusion. These are two critical elements of overall policy not only at EU level but at national level. While they are specific programmes and fora in their own right, they also form an important backdrop to policy setting for both jobs and growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Over the next several years under the new Lisbon Agenda, certain key priorities will be pursued. The Government will continue to manage the public finances prudently and pay close attention to competitiveness generally across our economy. It will strive to provide an environment where enterprise can flourish and consumers are protected, building further on our recent progress in research and development, particularly by adopting and implementing a new strategy to underpin the Government's research and development action plan. We will work hard to support enterprises to become more innovative and knowledge based. A new national development plan will be put in place for the period from 2007 to 2013. Details of a new ten-year plan will be announced for transport which will be implemented and supplement the already excellent work done.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The Government will press ahead with its ambitious but necessary regulatory reform programme. The sustainable use of resources and the strengthening the synergies between environmental protection and growth will be encouraged. A range of measures will be provided to support people seeking to enter the labour market and those already in it who wish to improve their skill levels. This will be achieved while ensuring the labour market policy contributes to making our economy more knowledge based and innovation driven. Work permit arrangements will be codified, protections for migrant workers will be improved and a new green card system to contribute to overall labour supply in Ireland will be introduced. The Government will continue with a programme of specific measures to combat long-term unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Investment in our education system and the promotion of greater participation at all levels will continue. The Government will implement the national framework for the development of lifelong learning. A national reform programme will be implemented over the next three years to build on our strengths, improve on any remaining shortcomings and keep Ireland at the forefront of building a competitive Europe with strong economic growth and employment.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_461">(3) appoint one Minister and one Department to be fully responsible for the area of early childhood care and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The issue of child care seems to have suddenly bitten us in the face in the past seven or eight years. It is an obvious product of the economic prosperity we have enjoyed. I welcome the advent and growth of multinationals in Ireland. I welcome full employment, for which I give the Government and many other economic forces credit. I also welcome the fact that we have a well educated workforce. The coincidence of these three ingredients, while giving us unparalleled prosperity, has also given us problems which we have been slow to recognise. They are obvious ones that have emerged as a result of the frantic pace of life that has followed the Celtic tiger and economic prosperity. We encounter them in our daily lives in the traffic problems and other activities unknown in the Ireland of the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Child care presents one of the biggest challenges of the day. Possibly the biggest downside of our prosperity is the problems which parents engulfed in the Celtic tiger face because of the fact that they have so little time. A lifestyle problem has resulted from this prosperity. On the one hand, busy people have made the decision to throw themselves into the economic cauldron and become part of it. On the other, equally worthy individuals have decided they will not get involved but stay at home and look after their children. Major tensions have arisen from the different agendas of the groups concerned. It is difficult to move in favour of one without offending or discriminating against the other. The Government will face this problem in the budget which will be discussed here in early December. There is a conflict between those who have taken the decision to take time out with their children and those who have decided not to do so but to make money in order for their families to prosper.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Both categories are of equal value and should be applauded, but there is a conflict between having time with one's children and earning money. This cannot necessarily be resolved by legislation. The problem of choice can be tackled in the budget, and measures can be implemented to give people some more time if they are suffering from the time deficit, or perhaps some more money if they are at a loss in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I have read some interesting relevant figures in a document entitled School Age Childcare in Ireland. The document does not concern crèches but rather the problems facing parents who are interested in the area of after-school care. The statistics in the document indicated that the problem was not just related to parents or their children in Ireland, but to the extended family also. The statistics pointed out that of 67,500 people involved in the survey, 46% used unpaid relatives to care for their children after coming home from school; 14% used paid relatives; 32% used paid carers; 6% used crèches; and 3% used other means. This indicates that the problem is not just a parental or business problem, but one which takes in extended families and the whole of Irish society. The Government will ignore this issue at its peril.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Grandparents are involved in this process to a particular degree. These people are no longer able to do the things that they wish because they are involved in caring for their relatives, namely their grandchildren. Voluntary or other work which they might do otherwise in the community will suffer as a result. This shows that the problem has tremendous knock-on effects throughout Ireland and its society. We should examine the pressures on the parents and consider what can be done to help them. Those parents who go to work often feel considerable guilt about ignoring their family. Nevertheless, they may naturally feel compelled to work because of financial pressures and a desire to be a part of the extraordinary economic race being enjoyed by Ireland at the moment. Those who stay at home may feel forced out of work because they cannot afford the child care costs imposed by crèches.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I hope the budget will above all consider the primacy of the child. We often hear about what the economy can afford, as though we are not talking about real people. We hear much about the employer and what he or she can afford. We also hear much about what the parents can afford. I contend that this particular burden of the good of the child can be shared far more equitably than it is at the moment. Such action would give parents a greater choice, giving an opportunity for part-time work, for staying at home if desired or for staying in the workforce but getting more leave to spend more time with one's children.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I wish to address the issue in connection with big business. It is perfectly reasonable for the State to require those businesses that can afford it to provide, at the very least, crèches for children belonging to their staff. Very few do so. Some semi-State companies, such as Aer Rianta, the ESB and RTE, do so at very subsidised rates. The Bank of Ireland also provides a crèche for its employees. In contrast, some rich companies, such as CRH, do not provide such facilities. Most large businesses do not provide crèches, although such facilities are not particularly large expenses. Although they may cost a few million euro per year, the companies could well afford them. Such provisions would meet some demands of the workforce. It is extraordinary that AIB does not provide these services, but not many multinational companies do so either. This is regrettable. I suggest that Intel and others might take the lead on this issue, and the Government might pressure the companies to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">If we ask big business to play its part, the problem arises of what to do with smaller businesses. Large businesses can afford and should provide crèches or other services to employees to make their life more palatable if they have children. Small businesses may state that such an act would be impossible for them and that giving parental leave is difficult. They may also argue that special arrangements are troublesome because the companies depend on their employees, and that the provision of crèches is out of the question. It would not be unreasonable in that case for the Government to provide some form of tax breaks for small businesses. We do not have to treat all businesses in the same way on this issue. Various thresholds can be put in place, for example, with big business having to provide a certain level of facilities and small businesses receiving tax allowances. The problem could be assuaged in this manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I was shocked by some relevant statistics that I read from various sources. Many people pay far less on their mortgages than they do for crèche facilities. Some may pay more than €30,000 for the crèche services. As this is a net figure, people may have to earn up to €50,000 in order to pay for having their children in crèches. It is an extraordinary figure and a large disincentive for people going to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I will finish on this point. This country spends little compared with other European countries on child care, and this is a signal that we should give people more choice. We should require that parents, business and the Government play their respective parts in paying for and providing child care. There should be a division of the difficulty to give parents more choice and allow people to do part-time work. We should also consider a great inconsistency-——</p>

For good or for ill, we have for the most part abolished third level fees, and we have free secondary and primary schooling. We should examine the possibility of having at least one year of free pre-schooling also. According to leaked reports the Government is considering this option, and the cost will only be approximately €140 million.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_137">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_474">I second the motion and welcome the Minister to the House. I am pleased to see my colleague Senator Ross joining the great and the good and supporting extended public services. It is always good to see. I thank the Minister for taking a personal interest in the matter, but he might indicate if he has had the time to read the amendment to the motion. I am prepared to try to convince my colleague Senator Ross to accept the amendment as an addendum to the existing motion so that all Members can work together to resolve an issue on which there should not be division. There is nothing wrong with the amendment, except that it notes and acknowledges the progress made. No Member would deny that. We are prepared to accept it as part of the motion if the Minister accepts the set of proposals we have tabled.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I agree with my colleague Senator Ross about this issue's importance. All Members can confirm what they hear on the ground concerning it in terms of the number of people who cannot afford child care or whose bills and invoices demonstrate that their child care costs are greater than their mortgage repayments. This is a common occurrence at present. I will put six points to the Minister which I will then develop. The first point, which arises all the time is that one Minister and one Department should be the prime movers in respect of this issue and should deal with this area. I also know the Minister's views on this matter. The idea whereby responsibility moves between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science, with one playing against another, does not work. The Minister has informed me, both publically and privately, that he does not have a problem with this step, which would simplify matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Second, I want to see maternity leave increased to 26 weeks in the budget. I have asked for this before and it is in line with what is happening throughout Europe. We can afford to and should do so. The third point is that we do not have paid parental leave. Senator Cox shares my views on this subject. I am sure she will vote with this side of the House by supporting our motion. There should be paid parental leave for 26 weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Fourth, there should be universal access for all three year olds. It is interesting to note that the OECD report makes great play of the solid level of support in Ireland for four to six year olds. The reason that Ireland differs from many other countries in this respect is that the Irish primary school system begins at four years of age. This is despite the attempt of a previous Government in 1981 to eliminate universal access to primary schools for four year olds. We are now reaping the benefit of its maintenance. However, it is only one aspect of a wide issue, namely, the kindergarten area of primary schools. Universal access and a free place for all three year olds must be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I wish to develop the theme of the importance of choice. It is important to provide various places for children, such as learning environments and play groups. Some would be structured and others would be informal. While I will return to this point, one important feature should underpin any choices available to parents, namely, that whoever supplies the service should be accredited in some way by an accreditation body. This does not mean that everyone is obliged to have the same accreditation. It could be a teacher, a child care worker, someone in charge of a play group or a child minder in some cases. However, in general there must be some system of recognition for anything that is done on a commercial basis. Everyone will agree that this would provide reassurance to those who must make choices for their children. The final issue is to recognise that parents who are not in the workplace outside of the home must also be catered for. A balance must be found and I ask the Minister to consider it.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The amendment refers to the fact that a number of reports have been published in recent months. The National Economic and Social Forum report has been examined and teased out. The National Women's Council has carried out and delivered a report which takes a structured approach to the needs of children from birth to 12 months, from one year to three years and from three to six years. The report has been delivered in a pointed, focussed and helpful manner. Work has also been carried out by the Irish Childcare Policy Network, which is a combination of an enormous number of groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">It is important to recognise the diversity of the groups involved in the network because I remember having a long argument about this issue approximately four years ago with the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, when I was still president of ICTU. He told me that if I could secure the agreement of all the interest groups on one set of proposals, he would give serious consideration to its implementation. He stated that while he would make money available in such circumstances, he would not again be caught in the position of introducing a measure which would be welcomed silently by many people and severely criticised by those few who disagreed with it. He told me that if I could achieve a consensus view on the matter, he would be prepared to move forward. That was Mr. McCreevy's sincere view. He stated that he was unable to find the line that met everyone's needs. Subsequently, there has been a convergence of views regarding these issues as can be seen from the Irish Childcare Policy Network's proposals, which are also a condensed and focused set of policies. Similarly, the centre for early childhood development and education's report has just become available to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I make this point because we do not need a further report or further consideration. We need structures of Government policy to be implemented. Such a policy should be informed by choice and by quality in terms of accreditation. It should provide universal access, should apply to parents at different levels and should be seriously funded by the Government in the forthcoming budget. I ask the Minister to hammer the Cabinet table — he will enjoy doing so and his colleagues will listen to him — for the children of Ireland. The children will not vote next year but they will do so sometime. The Minister who delivers these proposals will leave a fair legacy for the future. I ask that this be done and that we will see direct support, new access and appropriate tax adjustments in the budget so the needs of all are met.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">As I do not have time to expand my themes further, I wish to reiterate six simple points. There should be one Minister and one Department with responsibility for child care. Paid maternity leave should be extended to 26 weeks as should paid parental leave. Universal access for all three year olds should be provided as should an accreditation system to ensure quality within the system of provision, be it community, qualified people or otherwise. We should consider the needs of parents at home. I ask the Minister to respond in a positive, generous and open-minded way in this matter and look forward to him doing so.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">I am somewhat taken aback by the benign manner in which the Independent Senators have addressed this debate. I have been a Member of this House since 1997 and am completely frustrated by the lack of progress on this issue. I am frustrated by our apparent incapacity to come up with solutions that deal with it. Undoubtedly, we have made progress and the amendment outlines it in terms of the money which has been spent on child benefit and the additional spaces provided, which are important. However, we have not moved realistically to deal with the issues which have been continually discussed in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I have reviewed my contributions to the House on this issue since 1999, which was the first time I spoke on it. I am disappointed that more has not been achieved. We do not have any Government initiatives to support small businesses and have not implemented real incentives to allow jobsharing or reduced working hours for mothers and fathers. We do not have paid parental leave. We finally extended maternity leave last year to 18 weeks paid leave. However, I understand that the top rate is just over €200 per week. That is nothing for anyone with any kind of a job, who has a mortgage to pay. One's mortgage and car payments do not go away when one has a baby. One is obliged to buy equipment like buggies and prams while one is on reduced earnings unless one is lucky enough to work in a company where one's salary is covered or in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">As my time is short, I wish to move on. As the Minister is undoubtedly aware, Ireland spends less than 0.2% of GDP on child care. The OECD average is 0.4% and the United Kingdom is moving towards 0.8% on foot of recent initiatives. Sweden and Denmark pay 2% to 2.5%. These figures refer to governmental spending. On the cost to a family, the quarterly national household survey showed that, of 59,000 families whose principal arrangements for minding their children during normal working hours involved paid child care, the average amount paid was €97.50 per week in the last quarter of 2002. The rate per hour is significantly more expensive in Dublin than other areas. For Dublin pre-school children, the rate was €4.09 per hour and for school-going children it was €5.47 while it was €3.25 and €5.40, respectively, in the rest of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">As I have said time and time again, there are simple actions we could take. A significant number of people in this country employ child minders. They pay out of taxed incomes and do not receive recognition of this in the tax system. I gave an example to the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, and other Ministers previously that, if I fall on a golf course and break my toe and it costs €10,000 to get it treated, I can claim that against tax. If I pay €20,000 to a child minder out of my net income, I cannot get any of it back through the taxation system. This is wrong and we can change it immediately. We are employing people, deducting tax and sending it to the Revenue Commissioners. Is there any justice in employer's PRSI of 10.75% paid on a salary of €20,000 or €22,000 after having already paid 40% on it? Why have we not done something about this matter? This is not the first time I have discussed this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">We slap our backs about how many child care places we have supplied, which are marvellous, but what about the increasing numbers of women going to work and having children? I have four children, which means I need four child care places. While the number of places is growing, we will need over 80,000 child care places for children aged less than five years according to figures notified to the Department of Health and Children in 2004. It is of no use to say we are doing brilliantly and providing many places. It is not enough. I could tell a person who had broken a leg that, while it was sad, both legs could have been broken but this would not make me feel much better. We need to tackle this issue urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">We could examine what has been done in the United Kingdom over the past two years. I will cite a report entitled Early Years: Progress in Developing High Quality Childcare and Early Education Accessible To All. A nursing grant, not based on income, is paid for all four year old children and, since April 2004, this is paid for all three year olds after the child's third birthday — a maximum of £407 per term. A working tax credit replaced the working families tax credit in April 2003. Through this, up to 70% of eligible child care costs and up to a maximum of £135 for one child and £200 per week for two or more children can be claimed. This is based on incomes and is given to lone parents over 16 years of age with dependent children, couples over 16 years of age, either with both of them working at least 16 hours per week or one working at least 16 hours and the other receiving disability benefit or being in hospital or prison. It is payable up to first September after the child's 15th birthday or 16th birthday if the child is disabled. There is the child tax credit, in which the family and baby elements are each £545 per year. The child element is £1,445 and the disability element is £2,155. This credit is paid to the main carer, is based on family incomes and is available to households with at least one dependent child under 16 years or one dependent young person under 19 in full-time education. In the so-called new deal for lone parents, a maximum of £135 per week for one child or £200 per week for two or more children is paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">These are the types of initiatives we could put into place. We have discussed this issue since I became a Member of the House in 1997 but suddenly found a bright renewal of the subject during the by-elections in counties Meath and Kildare. What were we doing beforehand? Were our heads in the sand or did anyone listen? Where were the children and what was happening to them? The Minister probably did not formulate this amendment and I do not know who did but it does not refer to children at all. This is a disgrace. What is a child policy if it is not focused on the good of children? I am ashamed of this amendment but am proposing it, as that is what one does when one is a member of the Government party.</p>

I plead that the Minister does so and gives us results. Let us see some initiatives in the next budget that will deal with the issue and look after children, families, businesses and Irish society. This is a moral responsibility and we must lead the country. We need to continue creating an Ireland in which we are proud to live and bring our children up and that manages and sustains the type of economy we need to provide these services.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_141">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_507">I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I admire Senator Cox for her honesty and courage in standing up to the parties in Government as they have not been listening to us for many years. I believe it was the Taoiseach who admitted that he did not realise child care was such an issue until the two recent by-elections, which shows the Government was not listening. Child care should have been an issue long before now. It should not be addressed in terms of just facilitating women returning to the workforce or helping to retain them there as this matter is about providing a good quality, affordable and overall child and educational care facility in every sense of the word.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">We are playing catch up but this amendment does not do the Minister justice. While we must accept many such amendments have been made, this only scratches the surface. I acknowledge and welcome that much of the work carried out under the early opportunities child care programme, EOCP, was focused on disadvantaged areas. If we are to invest money, the less well off in our society must get a leg up first. Money invested at that level brings about a good return but money invested anywhere in the child care area is well invested.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I am not sure whether my figures match Senator Cox's but I recently acquired a report launched by the Combat Poverty Agency, which states: "Public expenditure in Ireland on pre-school education and care is near minimal. Less than 0.2% of Irish GDP is invested in child care, half of that of most other industrialised countries and just a fifth of the EU target of 1% of GDP". It goes on to state: "International research has shown that the rate of return to society in the long term is significant." Money invested in early childhood education and care, irrespective of where children come from, will pay dividends in the long term, of which there is proof. Taking the prisoners in Mountjoy Prison as an example, they certainly did not get any early childhood education and fell out of education at very early ages. Look at what this costs us in the long term. If we are to start from scratch, we must target money at the early years, as we will see a return benefit to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Currently, 80% of children are minded in the informal economy, which is an unregulated sector that we do not place great value on. It mainly involves family members or friends and is unpaid work for many people. Some people are lucky, as they have a granny or sister down the road who will do that work but this is becoming more and more difficult because people are no longer in positions or do not want to do it. Perhaps the granny will take her daughter's child or other children in or the sister will do it. We must put such child minders into a regulated market but ensure that we do not tax them out of it. If one allows them to earn a certain amount tax free, one could regulate that market and improve the quality. We must ensure the quality is of an extremely high standard because the child must be at the centre of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">We must also examine the first year of a child's life. All research has shown that year is better spent at home with the mother where possible. We must try to introduce it through extending maternity leave and paid parental leave. This could be done over a number of years, although not too many.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Work-life balance issues must also be considered. It is not good enough that parents must leave home at seven o'clock in the morning, drop their child to a crèche and collect the child at seven o'clock in the evening. That is not good for any child and it is not good for parents. We must consider what type of society we want. Those hours and pressures on parents must be tackled. This must be done in consultation with industry and local government to ensure parents are facilitated in getting flexi-hours or in other ways to combine work and family.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">We must be careful that we do not discriminate against the parent, whether it is the mother or father, who chooses to give up work and stay at home. They are also at a financial disadvantage. We discuss parents who have high child care costs. However, the couple or single parent who chooses to give up many advantages by staying at home are also at a financial disadvantage. They are trying to survive on one income. My son and his wife have two children. They have chosen to live on one income and they make enormous sacrifices. That work must be recognised. Work by parents, particularly mothers, has been undervalued for many years. It is time to re-examine society and put a value on it. I do not mean monetary value only. It is about the child's care, education and early childhood education and providing working or stay at home mothers with the ability to access child care or early education.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">I support the concept of one year free pre-school for three or four year olds. That is of enormous benefit to the child. Studies show that such a pre-school year will benefit a child's development for many years. That is a long-term benefit to society. Child care should be under the remit of one Ministry. Having it spread across so many Ministries is doing it a disservice. With so many people having responsibility for it, who is ultimately responsible? That must be tackled and I hope the Minister will examine it.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Barnardos states that the issues of affordability and lack of places are still of concern to parents. It states that child care costs to parents in Austria equates to 5% of gross average industrial earnings, in Japan it is 8% and in Ireland it is 20%. This rises to 50% if two children are in day care. Much needs to be done to make child care affordable and providing places will be an enormous task.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_516">I thank the House for the opportunity to speak here this evening and thank Senator Cox for the full and generous way in which she proposed the Government amendment. It strikes me that I should say a few words on this occasion in response to the debate we heard so far. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my personal responsibility as a Cabinet member is on that aspect of child care which falls within the equality section of my Department. For the first time, €500,000 million will be spent over a period of seven years on a programme on child care provision in this State. I wish to put on the record the contrast between that and the fact that less than €2 million per annum was spent by the Department in the last year of the erstwhile rainbow coalition.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">In 1997 the Government was faced with a series of conflicting demands as to where it should place financial resources for the costs faced by caring and coping families bringing up their children. People demanded that we reinstate child tax allowances. Others argued that would be wrong in principle because those allowances benefit those at work rather than those who want to enter employment but find themselves excluded by market conditions. The strategic decision was made that the Government would put an enormous amount of money into the issue of child benefit so it would benefit everyone in the community and not simply those at work.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Senator Cox mistakenly stated the Government amendment, which she moved, did not refer at all to children. In 1997, the State gave parents €506 million in child benefit. Now, it is giving €1.9 billion to parents in child benefit. That is an enormous increase and goes right across the board. It is of equal value to everyone in and out of work, every week and month of the year, regardless of economic circumstances. It is a socially progressive measure to support the cost of child care across the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I wish to contrast what this Government does, compared with the previous coalition Government, which fancied itself as having something of the left about it. Let us examine it closely. Since 1997 every household, including those at the bottom of the economic scale, has received a four-fold increase in child benefit support.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Since 1997, the equal opportunities child care programme has been an outstanding success. In partnership with European funds, it has attracted a vast flow of money into this State for the first time. That money is directed towards equality of opportunity based child care. That is socially progressive child care. None of those expenditure programmes existed when the parties of the left were in office in this country. Let us remember that nothing of that kind was attempted. Approximately 40,000 child care places will be created and sustained by the equal opportunities child care programme. Much of this will be directed to the have-nots in our community rather than the haves.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Ireland is changing demographically. This evening's newspaper reported that we have one of the highest birth rates in the European Union. Unlike most EU members we are now sustaining ourselves through our reproductive patterns and that is a good thing. As Senator Ross wisely pointed out in proposing this motion, the participation rate of women in our economy has been dramatically transformed from over 400,000 women in the workplace in 1995 to well over 800,000. This has been a dramatic change in Irish society and carries an important agenda for political action to bring about child care facilities that match the needs of that changing society.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">It is easy to come up with "back of a beer mat" and ill thought-out responses to the need for greatly enhanced child care provision in Irish society. For example, we can learn from the experience we had with grants for first-time house buyers, which increased house prices and subsidised the building industry rather than reducing the price of houses. The same applies to naive models for subsidising the provision of child care places through the tax system alone. If we subsidise a finite number of child care service providers through a tax allowance to their customers, the hard-pressed parents of Ireland, the cost of child care will jump to absorb the additional funds but the number of places will be much slower to increase. We must recognise that we need to increase the supply of high quality child care places to those who need it and to increase genuine choice as Senator Norris pointed out.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_526">As Senator Ross said, choice is the crucial element. I accept what Senators Terry and Ross said about the need to respect the rights and values of parents who make a financial sacrifice to provide parenting in their own homes. If we talk about choice we must focus on the supply of child care places. Senator Minihan proposed that we examine the possibility of increasing the number of child care places in the community through an income tax and social welfare disregard for the suppliers of small scale services. That should be examined as a real way of increasing the number of places. Some people are lucky enough to have relatives who provide support during their child rearing years. However, many do not have relatives or live so far away from them that it is not an option. Yet many people in the community provide child care in an informal way and would be willing to provide it to a higher standard and within the regular economy if the State offered assistance. We have an income tax and social welfare disregard for certain house sharing arrangements and could use a similar approach to the supply of child care places.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">Senator Minihan has also championed the provision of school age child care, and my Department has published a report to which a number of speakers have already made reference. Although there is much to be said and done about the first three or four years of a child's rearing, school age child care must be addressed. During the week I had the pleasure of opening a new school age child care facility in Goatstown, Dublin, which is exactly what my Department is seeking to stimulate countrywide. Voluntary groups of parents, in association with school authorities, could use a portion of a school campus to provide child care before and school after school hours. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, through the city and county child care committee network is now stimulating demand for this type of facility across Ireland through advertisements in local and regional newspapers. The enterprising start made by groups such as the one in Our Lady's Grove in Goatstown is an example but there are others.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Many national schools have declining school numbers and some have fought back by providing on-campus child care facilities. This attracts parents who wanted those services, which fall around but not directly through the provision of primary education by traditional means. Many of those schools find they can attract a population of school children and their schools are no longer marginal. Their future position is assured by virtue of the fact that they provide not just primary education from 9 a.m. to 2.30 p.m. but a service which starts at 8 a.m. and continues until 6 p.m. by a combination of traditional primary education delivered through conventional means along with the additional feature of a voluntary school age child care service in close association with it. That is an important development.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">I am glad the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is pushing this scheme forward, through the child care committees, to stimulate demand across the country for these services and to grant aid them. I appeal to such groups in the community to realise the huge value and potential synergy that exists in marrying our primary education infrastructure, through a parallel process of topping it up on both ends, that is, pre-school and after school, with a decent service that provides a seamless system of school age child care for parents who need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">There are tax implications in our present system for many couples. As Senator Ross correctly pointed out, some large firms are now providing crèche facilities and child minding services for their employees. These are not regarded as a taxable benefit-in-kind. However, if one does not work for one of those companies and if one's employer provides off-campus assistance with child care, it is regarded as a benefit-in-kind. That is wrong. It is also wrong that in the case of small scale enterprises, which could not possibly ever organise child care facilities of that kind, it will be a discrimination against their employees in that they are perforce excluded from that type of approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Senator Cox suggested there should be tax relief for those who retain the service of an in-house dedicated child minder in their home. I listened to the Senator with interest. I do not like to discuss my domestic arrangements but I am aware of how significant the cost is if one plays by the rules and pays PAYE and PRSI for such a service. However, those who are in a position to do that at present are generally among the better off in society. They have two incomes. Paying a full-time child minder at home is expensive and while consideration can be given to this, we should look to the coping families who are not, and could not be, in that position. They need some assistance. The Government will have to take a more broad-based approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I wish to refer to the suggestion that I should thump the Cabinet table for resources for child care. The party I represent in Government has played a very constructive role and I praise Senator Minihan for his part in leading the debate on a new departure in State policy on child care. It is open to Senator Cox and her colleagues to thump the parliamentary party table, when they meet their Ministers, to seek similar success and progress in developing the debate.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_534">A number of Members have said there should be one effective political head of the State's child care policy responsibility. From the point of view of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the assistant secretary in charge of this programme, Ms Sylda Langford, recently told an Oireachtas committee that it is an accident of history that we found ourselves with this responsibility. However, that has not inhibited us from putting in place an excellent equal opportunities child care programme. I am proud of what the Department has achieved in that programme. Undoubtedly, other political models were available but as long as it remains my responsibility, I am committed to achieving the highest standards and the greatest result for the resources available to me. I will continue to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">However, I do not do this in a selfish or vainglorious way. If there were a redistribution of political responsibilities and this responsibility fell elsewhere, I can say, not merely as the political head of the Department but for the entire Department, that it will co-operate with the centralisation of that responsibility in one political Department of State which would have an overall view of the issue. There is no selfishness or turf war. I am concerned about the welfare of children. Great things have happened in the context of the equal opportunities child care programme but it makes sense that child care should be the responsibility of one person who provides for it both within and outside of the equality rubric and, possibly, in the context of one of the departmental alignments represented by the Departments of Deputy Séamus Brennan or Deputy Ó Cuív. It would make more sense to establish a single child care political responsibility under a single Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">In saying as much, I am not anxious to be rid of it. I found it one of the most rewarding aspects of the Department which I have the honour to lead at present. It is also an area where the Department has delivered excellent results. If it is transferred to another Department in a realignment of governmental opportunities, I hope equally excellent results will arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">With regard to women in the home — and it is usually women in the home although some men provide parenting in the home in an enlightened, new age way — I believe they are entitled to full recognition in the Constitution. The terms of the Constitution recognise, even in 1930s language, that the parenting role of women in the home is a huge support for the solidarity and quality of life in our country. They should not be discriminated against or feel excluded. I recall what Senator O'Toole said about his dealings with the then Minister, Charlie McCreevy. When the Minister went to battle on individualisation and to give an extra incentive to those women who were leaving the home to work but were heavily penalised for doing so by the tax system, he discovered that the social partners who had egged him on and forced him forward on this matter were suddenly nowhere to be seen.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">When he looked for them, after being confronted by enthusiastic coverage of the issue by RTE, they had all gone to ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">He was right to point out that if people are willing to stick their necks out and make proposals in this area, they should stick with those proposals. My party recently held a policy conference on this issue and there is a real possibility of polarising parents, particularly mothers, into two categories — those who are in the home and those who are not — who will feel they are being set against each other over a limited pot of resources. Whatever is done, fairness must be shown to those who take their parenting obligations to the point of exiting the labour market or not going into the labour market to deliver to their children. What is written in the Constitution about women not being forced to work outside the home to the neglect of what was somewhat archly referred to as "their duties within the home" should be given some tangible social and economic reality rather than simply remaining a piece of rhetoric. I am aware that a number of Senators are members of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I often think that while the language of the Constitution in this regard may not be exactly right, the underlying message about the importance of parenting was progressive for its time. It was intended to oblige the emerging Irish State to recognise the importance of parenting and to protect the most vulnerable economic class from being deprived by economic necessity of the opportunity to provide parenting. However critical — it is fashionable to be critical of some of the language in the Constitution — one may be, its underlying message was positive, progressive and supportive of the parenting role. Even if it was gender-unfashionable and even if some of the language is a little hard to swallow these days, the underlying message remains that society must value parenting in the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">A reference was made here as well to the time-starved parents of today. It is certainly true that long commuting, long hours of work, traffic jams, etc., make it difficult for many families to cope and survive in modern circumstances and that this is an added pressure on parenting and raising a family. The Government, in the terms of the amendment proposed by Senator Cox, will address over the next weeks and months all of the ideas which are now bubbling forth in a ferment of political innovation on child care, but none of the proposals I have seen can provide a single solution to the problem. There must be a multiplicity of approaches to get the best possible outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">When I travel from time to time to London there is a point somewhere over the British midlands where one feels that the aeroplane is beginning to descend. Likewise, in the life of a Parliament there is a point at which we are on a descent path to our next encounter with the electorate.</p>

I acknowledge that she has been calling for one, both within her party and within this Chamber, for a number of years, but let us not devalue what has been achieved since 1997. Let us not set at nought the equal opportunities child care programme which has been a spectacular success. Let us not forget or regard as totally eaten bread that must be instantly forgotten the quadrupling of child benefit. Let us not forget the extraordinary contrast between what was on offer in the support of child care under the pre-1997 Government, which was so energetically supported by the left parties, and what has been available since then.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">I will finish on this note. I commend to the House Senator Cox's proposed amendment to this Bill. When one looks at the records of those who have the political responsibility in this area, Senator Terry used the phrase "catch up". Catch up in terms of what other countries in Europe do is one matter, but starting from zero was very much what this Government found because zero was the policy package we inherited from our predecessors.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The last postscript I will put on this speech is that when we are comparing figures spent on child care across Europe — I agree Ireland spends comparatively less of GNP on child care than other states — let us remember that in many Scandinavian and continental European countries education begins at the age of six or seven, whereas in Ireland, as Senator O'Toole stated, it begins at the age of four. Therefore, a considerable chunk of Irish expenditure on the education of children simply falls into the pre-school category in continental European countries because their formal education does not start until later. One is not comparing like with like and those figures must carry a significant health warning.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_592">The National Economic and Social Forum described in a policy audit how the Government was guilty of inaction, peripheral implementation and drift in the area of implementing policy on early childhood care and education. It was not the Labour Party, the Independent Group or Fine Gael that pointed this out, but the body set up by the Government to provide an objective view. Many of us are intrigued by how the Government managed to walk itself into the incredible mess in which it finds itself. It blundered into two by-elections and was quite surprised — similar to the surprise Charles Haughey got in 1989 when he discovered people were upset about the health service — to discover that young working families are in a state close to nervous collapse as a result of the struggle to pay high mortgages and the extraordinary cost of child care. The Government managed to sit on the housing price crisis for three or four years, presumably so that some people would get the opportunity to get rich. Therefore, it caused half of the burden and just ignored the other half.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">I have listened to the eloquence of the Minister who has been as eloquent as only he can be. Whatever else I might dispute, I do not dispute that he is eloquent. He is a bright, intelligent man, but I am not sure of his attachment to common sense. Nobody would dispute his intellectual equipment. His speech about what he has done was impressive. However, what he has done is just a drop in the ocean. We are talking about the needs of hundreds of thousands of families and children. There may be 250,000 families, including couples and single parents and up to 400,000-plus children in primary education. This estimation assumes something I would challenge, that no child over 15 years needs child care. This was not the case in my house when my children reached 15 and I suspect many here would say the same. This estimation is a conservative figure, therefore, in terms of the required provision of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I could devote my time to what I believe to be the most coherent set of proposals produced on this issue — those of my party which are coherent, costed and workable. It did not take us seven or eight years in government to produce those proposals.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_596">What we did was to hand over an economy in better shape than it is now. It had a better average growth rate and a lower inflation rate than the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, managed and had a budget surplus that he only managed to sustain by taking large amounts of money from the social insurance fund. Those are the facts of what was a responsible Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The problem was that the Government's agenda, driven as it was by the minority party in government, included the Minister for Finance although he claimed to be in Fianna Fáil, and also the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Transport and probably the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for a long time. There were actually five Progressive Democrat Ministers in the Government, two officially and three unofficially, all with a common ideology that did not involve or include public provision on the scale required by this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The problem is not just about public provision. It includes much more. However, when there is an ideological resistance to the idea of large scale public provision, it is impossible to come up with a coherent position. A coherent position is what is sadly lacking in the Government's position. It lacks a strategy which we can see it build on year on year, a strategy that should have started years ago. In the Minister's speech he states it is in the process of development.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">I love the term "high level group". I have heard about many high level groups. The phrase usually means a few senior civil servants are having a chat over a cup of coffee. The high level group mentioned by the Minister is to recommend an integrated national policy on child care and early education that will result in improved co-ordination at national and local level, etc. The group will recommend a policy which will presumably then go to Government to be thought about before proposals are produced. When will we get these proposals? We will get them about three weeks before the next general election. They will have the same substance as the 200,000 medical cards, the 3,000 acute beds and all the other promises made in the three weeks coming up to a general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The fundamental problem is that the ideological conflict has re-emerged at the heart of Government. Fianna Fáil has suddenly discovered that hitching itself to the Progressive Democrat star is a recipe for disaster and that it is now being blamed for the extraordinary ideological rigidities of the Progressive Democrats. The Progressive Democrat Party will survive with its four or five seats, but Fianna Fáil will lose ten or 15 because it walked away from its roots and instincts and allowed itself to be driven by a combination of blindness and ideology.</p>

          <p eId="para_605">We produced a brilliant economy. The Minister continues to laugh at that brilliant economy because that is all he can do. I will remember forever, in terms of a statement about the failure of this Government, Senator Cox's statement that she is ashamed of the Government amendment. She has every reason to be ashamed, not just of the amendment, but of the total absence of policy in this area, the absence of any sign of a future policy and the Government's apparent willingness to go off on a tangent of what happened eight years ago, which has no relevance for the hundreds of thousands of young couples struggling with the problem.</p>

          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_606">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and welcome the Minister to the House. We debated the issue of child care in the House several months ago and less than a month ago we debated the equally important issue of early childhood education. That we are debating it again so soon is testimony to the gravity of the issue and how it is viewed by all parties. Since the debate some months ago various interest groups such as parents, Opposition parties, and even Government Members have clamoured to agree that something must be done to help parents with their child care needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I thank the Minister for his comments tonight. I make no apologies for having banged the table, as he suggested, within my parliamentary party with regard to bringing forward proposals in this area. I suggest others should do the same. I do not believe the proposals I brought forward are the only way forward. My contribution was an honest contribution. If other parties and interest groups were equally as honest in their contributions to the overall debate, we might make more positive progress in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">With regard to points of order about who said what first, who cares? I do not care who came up with an idea once we deliver something for children. It does not matter who proposed it, once it is right for and in the interests of children. Everybody says that something must done but the problem lies in what that something is. It has become a major bone of contention between various and, at times, divergent groups. Some groups have even changed their opinion on what the solution should be in the short intervening period since our last debate on the subject. If one looks at the debate on child care on 9 March 2005, one can see that Senator O'Meara called on the Government to provide better financial support through a refundable tax credit when she moved the Labour party's motion. It is interesting to note that when the Labour Party, through Senator O'Meara, launched its child care policy last Thursday, it proposed a subsidy which would give equal recognition to the contribution of all parents, whether they worked full-time in the home or full-time or part-time in the workforce. What is most remarkable about Senator O'Meara's latest proposal is that it echoes the amendment to the motion on 9 March 2005, which commended the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">I presume it was not a cynical attempt to garner votes because such an attempt would, presumably, be beneath the Labour Party. This debate is far too important to concentrate solely on political point scoring. I would prefer to attribute Labour's Pauline conversion to the power of debate and the persuasiveness of the arguments put forward by this side of the House on 9 March 2005. We all agree there is an urgent need for action on child care and I am confident that action will be delivered in the forthcoming budget. Continued debate on this issue is most important because this State, like others, will be rightly defined by how it treats children, the sick, minority groups and the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The child care debate cannot take place in a vacuum and must necessarily take account of and reflect the national character. What value do we place on the work of a parent who decides to remain at home to raise his or her children? Do we recognise this work by granting his or her spouse an extra tax allowance or do we give the parent some kind of direct payment, as the State currently does in the form of child benefit? How do we cater for parents who, either through necessity or choice, return to work? Should we establish the kind of child care system that is available in Sweden, bearing in mind that it is predicated on the need to get more women into the workforce and that its guarantee of a child care place for anyone who requires it results in very high rates of personal taxation? These high rates mean that some parents who would otherwise remain at home are forced to work. The family cannot live on the net income of the sole wage earner. Do we wish to replicate this scenario in Ireland? Do we want this type of society? Can we recognise the work of the parent in the home while at the same time, establishing a Swedish-style child care system or are these two positions mutually exclusive? Is it a choice between one or the other or it is possible to have a watered down version of both? What about the other demands on the public purse, such as the health service, education, transport and pensions?</p>
          <p eId="para_616">It is very easy for the Opposition to call for major expenditure on one scheme. This is a luxury that is not afforded to those who have the responsibility of delivering services and it is a different story when the responsibility rests on one's shoulders. This fundamental truth is forgotten in the Independent motion, which opens thus —"Mindful of Ireland's unprecedented national wealth". This country is wealthier than it has ever been but the legitimate expectations of all sections of society have grown as the nation's wealth has grown, which I hope Members on the opposite side of the House acknowledge. I know of at least one political party on the opposite side of the House that recognises the truth of this statement and I applaud Senator O'Meara and her colleagues in the Labour party on their honesty on this point. I am sure Senator O'Meara and her colleagues will not be embarrassed if I quote from their child care document. The media missed one very important paragraph in the general excitement surrounding its launch. This stated: "The implementation of these proposals is subject to the overriding requirement to maintain stable public finances." It is an honest, if somewhat underpublicised, statement, which all parties and politicians would do well to remember. Even if the Labour party were inexplicably in a position to implement its dangerous increase in capital gains tax, the demands on public resources will remain strong and must be faced up to.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The child care debate has the potential to set one section of society against another — working parents against stay at home parents, single people against married people, old against young and sick people against well people. We should remember this point as the temperature rises in the run up to the next general election. In the meantime, the Government will continue to govern sensibly. It has stated that it will bring forward further measures to help alleviate pressure on parents and I am sure the budget will contain further measures to tackle issues relating to supply and demand. Perhaps, at that stage, the House will have a better idea of the direction the Government is taking and we can have a more constructive debate. If I did not support this Government amendment, I would neither propose it nor vote for it.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">As someone who spent all of her salary on child care at one stage of her career, I support this motion. The Minister spoke about the expense of employing a child minder to look after children in the home. This is probably the most economical form of child care today because crèches are appallingly expensive. I regret that there is still no crèche in this House despite the fact I have served here for approximately 13 years. When I first came the House, Deputy Mary Wallace, who had a young child, and I went to examine many crèches around the city. Deputy Wallace's child is now of an age to attend secondary school.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">We have spoken extensively about the cost of child care for those in the workforce and the situation regarding parents at home. What about the cost of child care for those who simply cannot afford it? I am very pleased by the Minister's statement that free places will be brought forward for these have-nots. I have been involved for many years with Cherish, the organisation for single mothers which is now called One Family. Certain women interviewed by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency stated that they had abortions because they could not afford to keep a child. We should remember this in our deliberations.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Children in secondary schools who become pregnant can drop out of education and without the efforts of some voluntary organisations, will never get back into it. People in third level education, with which I am particularly involved, drop out of education again because of the cost of child care places. There are insufficient child care places in universities given the enormous increase in the number of students. We need these well-educated young women for the workforce but if they have a child and do not have support from their family or a partner, it can spell the end of their career. I have been forced to find money from various funds for students who were paying for child care outside the university in order to subsidise child care places in other crèches. We must think about the education of these women as well as their children, which is why I strongly support the proposal by Senator Ross about the availability of free places. There are people who simply do not have the money for these child care places. I am involved with places which try to run crèches for nothing or to get money to subsidise payments to crèches so that people can remain in either second or third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Senator Cox and I have spoken about the French system, under which one can buy vouchers, or <i>chèques domestiques</i>, tax free and use them to pay people who work in one’s home. I have raised this matter during the debates on many budgets, without any success. I do not know why we cannot adopt such a simple system, which has been shown to work in France over a long period of time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_626">I thank Senator Henry for allowing me to contribute to this debate. The motion emphasises the need to consider the needs of parents who choose to care for their children themselves. Senator Cox and others have spoken about this aspect of the matter. Tax individualisation, which was mentioned earlier, is one of the great injustices of modern times because it penalises families in which one spouse stays at home to look after the children, rather than working outside the home. Individualisation is a textbook example of how, with the best will in the world, one can inadvertently create a wrong. It has been promoted as a means of getting more people into the workplace. The tax system makes it difficult for people to return to work because it treats them so harshly. It is unfortunate that when we created an incentive to get people to return to the workforce, we imposed a penalty on those who choose to stay at home. I urge the Government to examine, in advance of the forthcoming budget, whether it is possible to satisfy both camps in this regard. It would be wrong to continue to send the message that has been sent until now, although I was glad that the Minister, Deputy Michael McDowell, said today that "society must value parenting in the home". I have not read the Minister's script to check whether he meant to say that — his remarks may have been unscripted. It is easy for him to say that, but achieving it will be quite different.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">I would like to speak about the distinction that is made between child care and early childhood education. The Minister told us today that children in the Nordic countries do not start school until they are six or seven years of age. I understand why some of the figures which have been cited may not be quite correct. I have some experience in this regard because the supermarket I run has been involved in "play houses" in recent years. When children who have had experience of "play houses" go to school, their teachers say they find it much easier to adapt to the educational system. It is clear that education and child care can be mixed together.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_628">I found the Minister's speech very interesting, particularly when he hinted he might sniff an election in the offing, a comment that other speakers have echoed. I am worried that the possibility of an election might lead to a Dutch auction. Child welfare and the well-being of children should be at the centre of the child care debate. I am afraid we might revert to the Victorian position — the poor people with their children at baby farms and the wealthy people with their children at governesses. Such people never got to see their children. There is a real problem in this regard. It is a complex issue. I accept that people should be supported, but throwing money at the problem is not the answer, as the Minister demonstrated when he drew an analogy with the increase in housing grants, which simply served to increase the price of houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">I pity people whose lifestyles suffer because they have to commute to Dublin from places like Athlone and put their children into child care facilities for long periods of the day, having taken on heavy commitments such as mortgages. I do not think it is socially constructive that people have to live in such a manner. I am reminded of a story I heard in Cyprus a few weeks ago about a man who was living very happily and contentedly plying his trade as a shore fisherman. When he had a good catch one day, another gentleman came along the strand and said to him "I see you are a fisherman and you have had a very good catch, but you cannot continue to do that". When the fisherman asked why he could not do so, the man explained that he was an EU official and had to give the fisherman a grant to get a boat. When the fisherman asked what he would do with the boat, the man said he could hire other people and have a fleet of boats. When the fisherman asked what he would do with the fleet of boats, the man said he could retire. When the fisherman asked what he would do then, the man said he could go fishing. We are caught in a kind of catch-22 situation. The House should be aware of a series of reports, about which there is some dispute, which have suggested that too intensive an exposure to child care in the first three years of a child's life is damaging to him or her.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_636">I welcome the Minister to the House. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this issue. I am slightly confused, in that I would like the real Government spokesperson to stand up, like on the television programme. I admire Senator Cox's determination on the child care issue. As someone who has followed her comments on the matter since 1999, when she first spoke about it in the House, I am aware that she has been consistent at all times. I wish her luck in her further endeavours in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">We all agree there are major concerns in respect of child care. Many young parents who want to work, and need to work, cannot do so because the cost of child care is prohibitive and not enough suitable child care places are available. Many young people are working under extreme financial duress because they are trying to maintain a normal work-life balance. I agree with Senator Ross that this problem crept up on us during the years of the economic boom. I do not doubt that this country's social and economic landscape has changed dramatically over the last 20 or 30 years. Young parents have higher expectations nowadays. Unlike our parents, who lived for their children, young people of the current generation want to have lives to their own. They are right to want to enjoy their lives while also enjoying their children. As public representatives, we should attempt to give them some semblance of balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">A great deal of progress has been made in recent years. I understand that this country's population is higher than it has been since 1871. That approximately 10% of the population is under the age of six is causing many problems. I do not believe that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been sitting on its hands. Much has been done since Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats returned to power in 1997. As the Minister, Deputy Michael McDowell, said, some €500 million has been spent on the equal opportunities child care programme, which has been under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform since 2000, when the expert committee published its findings. I understand that the key objective of the programme was to increase the supply of centre-based child care places by 55%. The Minister said in his speech that 26,000 of the target of 31,000 such places had been achieved by the end of June 2005. The Department believes it will ultimately provide 40,000 centre-based child care places and support a further 23,000 such places. While that is not fantastic when one considers the total number of child care places which are required, it is certainly a step in the right direction. We now need to stir the pot in a big way. If I read correctly the signals sent out by the Minister for Finance at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis last weekend, a decent level of finance will be allocated under this heading in the forthcoming budget. I hope I am assuming correctly.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">When I read a document about the equal opportunities child care programme, I was interested to learn that the number of women in the workforce increased from 588,000 to 771,000 between 1997 and the end of 2004. The Minister told us tonight that the relevant figure has since increased to 819,000. It is significant to consider the proportions of women in part-time and full-time employment. The number of women in full-time employment has increased by 31% and the number of women in part-time employment has increased by 33%. It is interesting that 13,000 women considered themselves to be under-employed in 1997, whereas just 1,900 women deemed themselves as such in 2000. I imagine that such dissatisfaction has declined as employers have become much more sympathetic and flexible in their dealings with female workers. They have had to modify their attitudes because full employment has meant that fewer good people are available for work. If an employer employs a good person who happens to be a young mother, he or she will retain her services at all costs rather than trying to recruit someone else with less experience. While this may be happening by chance, there is now greater flexibility among employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">In my place of employment, which has a workforce almost 80% if not 85% female, staff are increasingly seeking to job-share. This happens primarily on the birth of a second rather than a first child. Many parents are prepared to give the first child to the grandmother but a second child is too much for a grandmother to take on. In any event, job-sharing is a far better financial proposition for parents. If a person in full-time employment who is paying full-time costs for child care decides to work part-time, he or she saves on tax credits or can pass them to a partner. Therefore, to only pay for part-time child care, if one could access it, would save money. However, I am told that crèches which take children for half days operate from 9 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., if they can be found, whereas employment is often from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., which presents a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The situation of lone parents is a serious issue. The 2002 census suggested there were as many as 150,000 lone parents in this country, 85% of whom were lone mothers. The statistics also show that a high proportion of lone parents live in poverty and are probably only surpassed in this regard by families headed by persons with a disability. Despite what we might have read in a recent newspaper article by an eminent journalist, very few people become lone parents by choice. Death, separation, divorce or having a spouse in jail can lead to lone parenthood. Employment is much more difficult to access for lone parents than for many others. Generally speaking — I do not mean this in a broad, sweeping way — many lone parents tend to be at a lower educational level. Apart from the fact that this makes it difficult to get work, lone parents must collect children from school at varying hours but many employers would not accommodate this. In addition, lone parents are not in a position to re-educate themselves. They form a group within this debate which must not be forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">It is heartening to note the changes being brought about by the equal opportunities child care programme. It is a small move, but in the right direction. I hope that following the next two budgets we will be singing a different tune on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_651">I wish to refer to tax individualisation. When the Government introduced the home carer's tax credit as a compensation for the spouse who stayed at home, I understood it was done on the basis that we would have an annual increase in the home carer's tax credit which has not been increased in five years. The relative position of mothers at home has deteriorated during that period despite all of the hypocrisy I heard at the time suggesting that their situation would be reflected by the home carer's tax credit. Tax individualisation was introduced five years ago. There has not been an increase in the credit in that time and the relative position of the one-income family, where the choice is made by one of the parents to stay at home to rear the family, has worsened.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">If we are serious about recognising the contribution of a man or woman to stay at home to mind his or her children on a full-time basis, why in the name of God can we not introduce some recognition of this in our social welfare code? I am not suggesting for a moment that parents at home would receive a pension without paying into it. However, a spouse who remains at home for four or five years looking after her or his children full-time should be entitled to a contributory old age pension. It is a disgrace that my wife, when she reaches the age of 66, will be regarded as a dependent adult and not a person in her own right who has worked at home and contributed hugely to Irish society and the economy. If we talk about recognition, let us have recognition for everyone in our society, not just for those who choose, for whatever reason, to go into the workplace. We must reflect that work at home counts as much as work outside the home.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_657">It was the 1994-97 coalition Government that first introduced a Ministry for children, in the name of the former Minister of State at the then Department of Health, Mr.Austin Currie.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I join with my colleagues in strongly supporting the motion, which highlights important issues in regard to child care. Most important, the emphasis of the motion is on the need for the Government to match any budgetary benefits given to parents in the workforce with tangible recognition of stay at home parents. I compliment Senator Cox in this regard. I hope she rejects the Government amendment to the motion. It is important she puts her vote where her mouth is.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">The motion also calls for the implementation of the recent report on child care through concrete provisions in the budget. We have had one Government report after another — one could call it the ultimate spin. While an appearance of activity and focus is generated, the issue it seeks to address remains unaddressed. The Government is high on proposals and low on implementation. This is undoubtedly the case with regard to the recently published NESF report on early childhood care and education, which added to the pile of similar reports high on policy and low on practical action.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">We have seen little action from the Government in this area. The Minister has boasted about what he is spending in specific areas but the areas highlighted by Senator Cox have not been dealt with. The Government, in the guise of a number of Departments such as the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science, has pushed the pace of policy production. However, perhaps because the "too many cooks spoil the broth" school of thought prevails, much has been attempted by the Government with little success.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Taking account of all of the contributions to the debate, it is important that any society is aware of its responsibilities to its young citizens. Ireland in particular could be said to be shamed by other countries that are less economically stable than ours but that make a far greater contribution to child care. At 0.2% of GNP, Ireland's contribution is below the Danish level of 8% which leads to a 90% pre-school participation. We are ignoring the early years of the development of future citizens at our peril. Anti-social behavioural problems, with which we are only too familiar, have been attributed worldwide to the lack of provision of early childhood education. At every public meeting this issue is highlighted. Children need to be brought into the education system as early as possible and facilities must be in place for parents. Progress in child care must become more than a series of recommendations. What matters most is the care of our young citizens. Safety and good practice must take precedence over any political opportunism.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">As this motion highlights, now is the time to free parents who wish to work outside the home from large bills and offer equality of benefit to those who wish to remain in the home. Senator Cox emphasised this point in the debate. I hope the Government listens to the Senator, as a parent and a member of its party, and does not fudge a good motion with this amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_664">I thank Senators and the Minister for contributing to this debate, which was useful even if it did not elicit a great deal of information from the Minister about the Government's intentions for child care in the budget. We did not expect that anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">One of the important matters to emerge in this debate is that this is not necessarily a problem about money. Money helps and we have plenty of it. If it was a problem over money, it could be easily resolved. I was struck by the extraordinary balance about the interests of the stay at home parent and the parent who goes to work. Both groups have extremely noble and good motives for doing what they are doing. However, they both have extraordinary problems as a direct result of our economic prosperity. We must ensure any measures taken do not turn them into rival camps.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">In the next budget, both groups could be partly satisfied by a programme of measures that recognised the extraordinary valuable role they both play. This debate is about values. We need the parent who stays in the home and the parent who goes to work. I am referring coyly to mothers rather than fathers in this case. The economy desperately needs the skills of those mothers who are going to work in their droves. As Senator Henry eloquently said, at one stage of her life she was actually paying out all her salary on child care. This is absurd and makes a nonsense of the medical skills which Senator Henry acquired at some expense to herself and to the State. We must satisfy that side of the equation.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">We must also applaud the tremendous role and the sacrifices made by those highly educated people who have decided they will not use their particular skills and join the workforce. This is either because they cannot afford child care or they consider looking after their children an even more important calling. This must be recognised in a tangible form, which means money. I noticed in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Government is considering a 30% rise in child benefit. This is not half enough. It should be a 100% rise. We are talking about recognising values. This must be done for the stay at home parent. I will address from where the money will come another day. In the next budget, we must satisfy the aspirations——</p>

        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_771">I welcome the Minister to the House and take this opportunity to recognise the efforts made by him on this issue. Both he and the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, have been available to Members and have met deputations and delegations from Ennis. The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has visited Ennis on a number of occasions in dealing with this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">There is difficulty surrounding the current quality of water in Ennis. The Minister has put in place the services of his Department to ensure that paperwork on the delivery of a new treatment plant will be expedited and that no unnecessary delay takes place. The Minister is well aware of the problem, which appears to be recurring. It is not satisfactory that the solution will take two years to be delivered, and it is not fair to the people of Ennis and surrounding areas served by the town's water supply. It is estimated that the treatment plant will take two years, going through the process of tendering and construction, and this is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Ennis is now on its third boil notice for this year and a review which took place today found an element of contamination in the water. The boil notice has been extended, and another test will be carried out tomorrow. I hope the boil notice will be lifted at that stage. Boil notices have been in place for two of the past five months, which is again unacceptable. Such circumstances create much inconvenience for the people of Ennis and residents, particularly the elderly and parents of young children, are living in fear. The Minister may be aware that the first boil notice was brought about as a result of the health services having concerns over a number of children presenting with symptoms associated with water contamination. When the county council carried out testing their hypothesis was proven correct and remedial action was taken. These are the concerns that have been to the fore.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">In addition, the reputation of Ennis as a tourism town, particularly in the light of its welcome success in the Tidy Towns competition, is now being eroded by the ongoing problem with the public water supply, which will have an impact on the future economic life of the town. This is not to underestimate the impact it has on the people who live there and use the water supply on a daily basis. Hotels are particularly concerned as their business is threatened. Concerns have also been expressed to me by a number of airlines, particularly those with transatlantic flights, regarding the overnight stay of their staff in Ennis hotels. The concern is that contaminated water could cause illness to pilots and air stewards while on their return journey. I do not need to explain the potentially disastrous consequences to the Minister. While this might sound over the top, it reflects the concerns of airlines who have seen the effects of contaminated water in other jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">We need urgent action to implement a temporary solution to restore confidence in the Ennis water supply until the permanent treatment plant is installed in two years time. I recognise that nothing can be done to speed up the delivery process of the new plant. The Minister has been extremely helpful in identifying all the processes and in facilitating the movement of paperwork. However, we must look to a temporary solution. I understand the town and county engineers are currently reviewing an interim solution that could provide a stopgap measure until the treatment plant is operational. I ask the Minister and his Department to assist this process in a number of ways. First, by the provision of any expertise available within the Department to define or develop a solution that would help to solve the problem on an interim basis. Second, if such an interim solution can be obtained, I hope that the Department would enter discussions with the town and county manager, with a view to making a special grant available to fund it.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">Currently, there is a real cost to the people of Ennis. When water is contaminated and a boil notice is in operation, many people do not trust the boiling process and buy water for drinking purposes. I ask the Minister to give some direction or assistance to the council to facilitate the deployment of tankers henceforth, particularly if the current boil notice continues beyond tomorrow or if a boil notice must be reinstated in the future. The cost of boiling water places a serious financial burden on many families, particularly those with young children and those we would consider to be among the most vulnerable in terms of social exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">I thank the Minister for his actions to date. While he has been to the fore in terms of providing assistance, some additional measures can be taken. While I recognise the construction process will take some time, some guidance from the Department to the council in respect of providing tankers would be welcome, if that becomes an ongoing necessity. I am particularly interested in seeing the implementation of a more robust interim measure that will endure for two years. Given that engineers are working on the project, I ask the Minister to consider making available the requisite financial resources.</p>

        <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_249">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_778">I thank Senator Dooley for raising this issue. I have spoken to him about this matter privately a number of times and I fully share his concerns. It is unacceptable that a town of the size of Ennis, or any town, should be subjected to regular boil notices. The issue was discussed in the Dáil last week by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who emphasised the urgent need for progress on a solution to the present situation. I appreciate this opportunity to express my concern and that of my Department for the people of Ennis and its surrounding areas who have been greatly inconvenienced by the boil water notices.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">This issue has occurred in my constituency a number of times. Senator Dooley is correct to state that it is enormously disruptive to be obliged to deal with this problem, particularly for households with elderly or young people. Moreover, trust in the water system declines. I also share the view that all stops must be pulled out to solve this problem quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The difficulty with the Ennis water supply system stems from its source's vulnerability to contamination from both septic tanks and agriculture. Currently, chlorination is the only process undergone by the water. While disinfection by chlorination normally produces a good quality supply, it must be supplemented by additional treatment to remove the occasional risk associated with chlorine-resistant organisms in the water.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The Ennis town water supply treatment scheme, which will put the necessary treatment facilities in place, has been approved for construction in my Department's water supply services investment programme at an estimated cost of €6.5 million. I have already given clearance to Clare County Council to invite tenders for the scheme and the money for its construction is available to be drawn down from my Department the moment it is required. There will be no delay in this respect. My Department's officials have been assisting the council to speed up the finalisation of the tender documents and the council has already short-listed a panel of suitable contractors who are being asked to tender for the scheme. I have impressed on officials the fact that I want the administrative process to be dealt with without any undue delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">I want the work to get under way at the earliest possible date. However, we must be realistic and remember that the infrastructure that will be put in place must solve the problem effectively and permanently. Any effort to cut time would mean cutting corners, with the consequent risk of future recurrences. We would have something second rate in place. The job must be done properly to avoid wasting public money, to ensure we get the right result and, above all, to ensure the people of Ennis have an adequate water supply in the future. The permanent solution is a €6.5 million project which will take approximately two years to implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">In the meantime, I do not wish to contemplate the idea of the people of Ennis being obliged to live under the threat of boil water notices and Clare County Council shares that view. The council has advised my Department that it is actively investigating the availability of temporary treatment facilities to tide the town over until the permanent new plant is in place. I understand the council is currently examining a number of such facilities with a view to securing and maintaining satisfactory water quality in the meantime. My Department will provide the council with any assistance or guidance it can to implement a temporary solution. I agree with Senator Dooley, who made the point that <i>in extremis,</i> tankers may be supplied. However, more substantial measures are also being sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I appreciate that temporary relief efforts will cost the council more money. Clare County Council is now the sanitary authority for the entire county and it has received generous funding through general purpose grants from the local government fund in recent years. Its allocation this year amounts to some €14 million, an increase of 7% on 2004 and an increase of more than 350% on the amount available when the Government came to office in 1997. In addition, the council's commercial rate income has been increasing steadily over the same period. The extra income from the revaluation of the ESB network alone increased the rates by more than €1 million this year. Nevertheless, if the council is obliged to provide a temporary facility, my Department will consider the circumstances of any case it might make for some support.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">I reiterate that my Department is working closely with the council to bring the present problems with the town's water supply to the speediest possible solution. I am conscious of the discomfort caused, particularly to the elderly and those with young children, who are most acutely affected. I realise how great an impact this problem can have. I do not want it to continue for a day longer than necessary. Everything will be done to get the new treatment plant in place as speedily as possible and the House can be assured that any personal contribution I can make in that regard will be brought to bear. As I stated, I will consider any proposals for an interim solution which are put forward from Ennis because I believe that a good, clean water supply is at the core of civilised living.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">I again thank Senator Dooley who has fought for this issue daily and has raised it with me continually. His energetic approach has ensured that I will do everything possible to assist his constituents in Ennis and County Clare.</p>
