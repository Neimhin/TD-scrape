          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to approve funding to buy lands beside Cahergal national school, Tuam, County Galway, so the board of management can proceed with work under the devolved scheme for primary school buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline when the proposed necessary extension and repairs will be carried out to Scoil Mhuire national school, Dristernan, Gleneely, Inishowen, County Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the plans for the Bon Secours Hospital in Tuam, which was purchased by the Western Health Board more than five years ago and is lying abandoned; and to indicate if she has approved the plans submitted by the Western Health Board.</p>

The motion concerns a change in the fees for licences issued or renewed on or after 1 January 2005, to be taken without debate; No. 2, a motion to approve an order under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, Commission of Investigation (Dublin and Monaghan Bombings) Order 2005, which enables the establishment of a commission of investigation to investigate and make a report on specific matters considered by the Government to be of significant public concern relative to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974, to be taken without debate; No. 3, Garda Síochána Bill 2004 — Committee Stage (resumed), to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 2 p.m.; No. 4, Road Traffic Bill 2004 — Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 3 p.m. and to conclude no later than 4 p.m.; No. 5, Social Welfare Bill 2004 — Second Stage, to be taken at 4 p.m. until 5 p.m., to resume on the conclusion of No. 23, motion 16, and to conclude no later than 9.15 p.m. on which spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and other Senators ten minutes and on which the Minister will be called to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; No. 23, motion No. 16, to be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. There will be a sos between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">It would be wise to take up the Leader's offer regarding No. 2. A debate on this issue in January will be useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Any time a proposal is made on this side of the House in regard to a retrospective amendment, we are informed by the Attorney General that the House cannot introduce legislation of that type. Now we see that the Government will attempt to pass emergency legislation through the Dáil and Seanad by the end of this week. The Government has now accepted that it was legally unsound to take pension and other payments from pensioners in long-stay residential homes or beds. Why has it taken three years for the Government to own up to this? It was informed as far back as 2002 by at least one health board that, following the provision of medical cards to those over 70 years of age, this situation was legally unsound.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">It is not appropriate that legislation can be rushed through in this fashion, so close to the Christmas recess. In effect, people have been denied the rights that were available to them over the past number of years. This is not the way to do business.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The Tánaiste is at least trying to correct the situation. However, her predecessor was aware of the situation when he negotiated with the IMO regarding the medical card scheme for over 70s as far back as 2001. He stated he would do it first and then held negotiations with the IMO. It was the worst possible deal ever negotiated between a Minister and a representative organisation. We must take this matter slowly. Mistakes were made in 2001 and we do not want to compound the situation by making more mistakes.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Senator Ó Murchú spoke earlier this week about the problem of the proliferation of knives and the knife culture that exists in our society. An incident occurred in this city last night where a nine year old stabbed a 14 year old. Following Senator Ó Murchú's call earlier this week we need a debate early in the new session on the problem of the knife culture in urban and rural Ireland. We must take measures to take these dangerous weapons out of people's hands quickly. While legislation exists in this area, not enough is being done.</p>

Previously I stated here that under the Road Traffic Act it is now an offence not to carry one's driving licence when driving a car. Nonetheless we are advised by the authorities that it is unsafe to keep a driving licence in the car as the licence or car might be stolen. Therefore, we must carry it on our person. The licence is made from a type of material that does not stand the test of time. I previously suggested to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that we should have driving licences available in a plastic credit card size form, as available in some countries in the world. This allows the licence to be a form of identification.</p>

During the summer holidays last year when people were probably more interested in buckets and spades than what was going on in the world of finance, a report was published showing systematic tax evasion aided and abetted by senior officials in NIB. This matter has never been discussed, addressed or considered by the Oireachtas. If this bank is sold as no doubt will happen, it will be sold at a profit of €1 billion, which is fair enough, but it will be sold to a new owner which will have no responsibility for the systematic tax evasion ripping off the taxpayer and the system, which occurred over the years. This should be discussed as a matter of urgency. I will be raising the matter at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and I would like to hear whether the Minister for Finance would like to discuss it.</p>

The bank, which is taking over NIB, has twice the capitalisation of either of the two big Irish banks and generates about the same level of profits, which speaks volumes about the degree to which we are being ripped off. The Competition Authority has just issued a report, which did no more than confirm what we all knew, namely that Irish consumers are being ripped off by the effective collusion of the Irish banks. We did not need the Competition Authority to tell us that; we needed it to do something about it, but it has singularly failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">I am glad the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is proposing to do something about the status of all those Irish children who until recently he was threatening to deport. I welcome his proposals. However, I do not understand why the parents of those children are still being denied the right to work. The argument used to be that it would be a factor to draw further illegal immigration and further abuse of the asylum system. This cannot be the case. Why will they not be allowed to work? Some of these people have been here for years and some have children close to secondary school at this stage. I did a back-of-an-envelope calculation and based on the Minister's figures those families not allowed to work are probably costing the State between €100 million and €150 million per year. Why does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the one hand highlight the cost of supporting asylum seekers and on the other hand refuse to allow a group of people in a unique situation to work?

          <p eId="para_36">I echo the comments of Senator Brian Hayes in calling for a debate on the knife culture. I wanted to clarify a point I made yesterday morning. While I was aware that legislation exists here, legislation on the carrying of knives also exists in Britain. However, it is now considered necessary to open up the debate and see the knife in the same context as a gun, as it is a weapon with which people are being killed. People do not carry knives unless they intend to use them. Young people now discuss among themselves the effectiveness of one knife over another and on what part of the body a wound should be inflicted. This is exceptionally serious. Yesterday morning I specifically referred to sentencing, on which we should have a debate. For instance, would the child involved in that stabbing incident have even though of it unless it had been part of a culture to which that child was exposed?</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I take up the point made by Senator Ryan on Seanad reform, which was discussed here in recent days. Some time before any discussion of a peace process, we talked about trying to ensure that at some stage if the peace process moved forward we would have the opportunity to give representation to those from the North of Ireland. I do not believe this has anything to do with a personal agenda of the Taoiseach. However, it is symbolic of the progress we have made in this country that we could even think about having that kind of unity of minds, unity of purpose and unity of debate. I would not like that to be sullied in any way and it is important that we keep it centre stage. On the day every political view in Northern Ireland is represented in this House, we will have truly copperfastened the peace process. I look forward to that day.</p>

While it is fine for most of us to leave our driving licences sitting on the dashboard or in the glove compartment, the necessity to have one's licence with one at all times poses problems for farmers and people who work in various industries and are obliged to switch from driving one vehicle to another. Consideration is required in respect of this matter.</p>

The subject matter of these games has not been addressed because they do not come in a video format but rather use computer generated animation.

The North West Alcohol Forum is ready to be piloted and to come up with proactive solutions to under age drinking. This body is made up of many State agencies and service providers. Its key element is that it has representatives from the Donegal Youth Council, made up of 16 to 24 year olds, who will decide themselves how to move forward. Will the Government fund the North West Alcohol Forum's five year pilot scheme? It offers a proactive solution to the problem of under age drinking. This side of the House has offered solutions to problems for the past 20 years and any time the Government is in trouble, we get the blame.</p>

If we are to have a debate on the way of life for young people, part of the discussion should focus on penalties for parents who do not behave responsibly and look after their children between 12 and 15 years of age.

He mentioned the North West Alcohol Forum, which is seeking funding for a five-year pilot project. The forum includes members of the Donegal Youth Council.

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_236">This section dealing with security officers worries me. It proposes that by giving a uniform and a badge to somebody that person will have the powers of a garda. I am totally opposed to that. When some people get a uniform and a badge they lose their heads. This section gives them the powers of the gardaí including "to seize, in exercising powers under this section, any weapon other than one in the possession of a person with lawful authority;". These are powers that only the gardaí should have. It is not acceptable to give voluntary forces and security people similar powers to those of the gardaí. There should be nothing of that sort in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I do not object to civilians doing jobs at desks and other such jobs to enable more gardaí to go out on the streets. This, however, gives security officers the same powers as the gardaí. What does the Minister of State mean by "adequate training" for these people? If the security people are to have the same powers as the gardaí they should have similar training to the gardaí in those areas. I oppose giving Garda powers to security officers. This would be a retrograde step. The gardaí are the guardians of the peace. That is how it should be, they have served us well since the foundation of the State. To give powers in other areas to quangos and other people is not acceptable. I oppose this section.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_143">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_238">I too am very concerned about this provision. The Labour Party opposes it and will put forward that opposition on Report Stage. It gives substantial powers to the designated persons, for example, to search and exclude people from a building. It will change the nature of places such as the National Gallery. People in Ireland are not accustomed to this. It exists in the United Kingdom and other places but Ireland is a different country with a much smaller population base and a reputation for a certain regime which tourists expect to encounter. We should take account of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">It could lead to people feeling their rights are infringed or their reputation is damaged in some way if, for example, there is a misunderstanding or difference of opinion as to whether a person refused to be searched and is excluded from a building. Many issues come into play. These people will have powers under statute with which it will be very difficult for a person to contend when making a complaint regarding civil rights. This Bill underpins a person's right to make complaints about what he or she regards as inappropriate conduct by the gardaí. There is no such provision for these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Senator Cummins mentioned training. Under this section the head of an authorised body can decide whether a person has received "adequate training for that purpose" yet the Bill provides that the Minister make regulations for Garda training. It refers to people who have entered into contract for the provision of security services and so on. Contract companies will provide security services and will be the designated officers under this provision. This has very significant implications for the future because although this legislation strengthens safeguards for gardaí, these do not apply to the new officers under this section.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_241">Senators Cummins and Tuffy are missing the central point here, namely that gardaí are tied up in these duties involving many gardaí and hours. Most people do not see that as the most productive use of Garda time and experience. Senator Tuffy said that when one goes to other jurisdictions and visits art galleries and so on one does not see the local police there. One sees special security people employed by the gallery and it is sensible that we adopt that practice.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_242">What about the Courts Service?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_243">I will talk about the Courts Service in a minute. There is prudence in this section. For example, it mentions only six areas in which these security officers will serve. The list could be more exhaustive and the Minister should consider other areas and identify them on Report Stage. If the Minister is to implement this measure he should have provision to roll it out without having to come back with other legislation. There could perhaps be a catch-all clause so that other locations which have not occurred to people yet, but might arise in the future, could be covered by a regulation to have the same facility of engaging their own people. The locations mentioned in the Bill are State bodies and their management is vested in people acting on behalf of the State. Therefore, one can rely on there being proper training and recruitment procedures to ensure that the people are of good repute and will carry out these duties with the required diligence. There are protections in the Bill to prevent abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Yesterday I made a point concerning the courts system to which Senator Cummins has now referred. If the courts system moved exclusively to using security people, I would have certain concerns. However, if it is moving towards having some security people backed up by gardaí, that is an entirely acceptable approach. I distinguish the Courts Service from other areas in that one can have a congregation of people, depending on the case, making security essential. Perhaps, in his reply, the Minister might confirm that, while the Courts Service can engage security people, there would obviously still be involvement on the part of gardaí, albeit on a smaller and more selective scale than at present. That must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The provisions in section 114 are very good and prudent. The main reason for us to have gardaí is to regulate society. Their prime function is to ensure that crime is prevented if at all possible, and that is done by high visibility and active involvement in operational duties. Where a crime is committed, it must be pursued diligently to detect the criminals and bring them to court before the laws of the land. If one considers that as a priority, one sees that it is like running any operation. Once one prioritises the functions, subsidiary functions should obviously be dealt with in a way that does not interfere with the primary objective. This section takes that on board.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_246">If one takes the Houses of the Oireachtas as an example, one sees that one could have a situation where a member of staff could be excluded from the Houses by a person from a security firm. I am straying a little, but if it were decided that an outside security firm should be used in the Houses, and some of those involved were designated officers under the section by the head of the Houses, there could be a disagreement between a member of staff and an officer with the result that the member of staff might be excluded. Such a situation could arise. That has important implications and my main concern is that the Bill has no element of accountability in the way that there is regarding members of the Garda Síochána.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_148">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_247">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The one section over which I would place a question mark is the Houses of the Oireachtas, since the presence of the Garda Síochána here is a big asset to the work of the Houses. It is all right now, since we are in peacetime, but in difficult times it was very important that they were here. They accord status to the Houses of the Oireachtas, which are not like the National Gallery or the National Museum. I would be very reluctant for the Government and the Minister to remove the excellent staff and members of the Garda Síochána who are present in the Houses. There are security positions in the Houses with cameras, and the staff are doing an excellent job. I would be very reluctant to change that system. The gardaí have tremendous status in the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The Army is in charge of security at night when the Houses close. Its training in this regard is very specialised. I do not know whether there is any provision for the removal of the Army personnel who take over the full security of these Houses from the close of business until the opening of business in the morning. We are fortunate in having the Army prepared to carry out this duty of protecting the institutions of the State and the Houses of the Oireachtas. It has a dual role in that regard, and I am delighted that members of the Defence Forces are here in the House. They have served the State very well, and it lends great prestige to the House to have members of the Army present for its security.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">I would be very reluctant to see members of the Garda Síochána withdrawn from service in the Houses if the legislation were enacted. I do not think the Minister will act in that manner, since their presence is a great influence on the many visitors to the House and a great support to Members and visitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The Bill deals with the issue of an ombudsman. There is a need for an ombudsman for the Garda Síochána similar to that approved for the Army, and I hope that senior officials will consider it. I brought up some matters on Committee Stage concerning the need for members of the Garda Síochána to have a complaints mechanism similar to that established for the Defence Forces, and I hope the Minister of State will convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, my strong recommendation that it be considered. Many of the matters that I raised on behalf of the Garda Síochána might be better dealt with by a dedicated ombudsman who could address them internally.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_149">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_252">I would like to contribute again, since I feel so strongly on this issue. Who will vet these "security officers"? Contractors will come in and act as such. We have heard on many occasions about other jurisdictions where such people have worked in art galleries from which there have been thefts. It is all right speaking up when something of that sort happens, but I would not like to be the one to say that he had warned the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">As Senator Leyden pointed out, people such as Heads of State and ambassadors attend the Houses of the Oireachtas regularly. They are to be met and protected by security officers of whose background we know nothing. We do not know who has vetted them or what training they have undergone. In the Courts Service, as Senator Walsh mentioned, in many cases there might be a number of dangerous criminals; yet security officers are to look after the security of the State and the Courts Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The Minister should rethink this section. It is not an appropriate response to what is required. I humbly ask him to return on Report Stage and amend this entire concept of voluntary guards and security officers. We are diluting the powers and status of the Garda Síochána, and I am not in favour.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">That is clearly not the case, and I will presently outline why. It makes eminently good sense that the Houses of the Oireachtas, the National Gallery and the National Museum be secured by private personnel. There are about 100 Garda posts involved, which necessitate approximately 500 gardaí being deployed in what are described as static protection duties. If we had 500 gardaí walking the streets of Dublin today, I can assure Senators that they would be much better employed in guaranteeing the security of the people and the State than in their current positions. That is the essence of this proposal, which makes eminently good sense. I reject out of hand the misguided views of Senator Cummins in particular.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">The purpose of the provisions of this section is to free up the position of gardaí engaged in what are described as static protection duties on public offices in the State, mainly in Dublin, as listed in the Bill. It may not be generally appreciated that retaining one member the Garda Síochána on this duty requires more than five other officers to be rostered for that duty. Proposals have been made over the years to allow for the release of this not inconsiderable number of highly-trained Garda officers for normal policing work. However, most of them have come to nothing. On the initiative of a previous Garda Commissioner about ten years ago, serious attempts were made to deal with the matter principally on an administration basis, but that came to nothing. The proposal in the Bill represents a determined effort by the Government to put the issue on a proper statutory footing.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">The one area where special provisions apply in regard to the detention of persons is the courts in accordance with a judicial direction. That is directly related to a person being found in contempt of court.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">Subsection (9) merely confirms that the security officers are no different from any other member of the public or from any other security personnel with whom we all come into contact in our daily lives in commercial premises, ports, airports, private offices and shopping centres, who may decide to exercise the right of arrest of a person whom they, with reasonable cause, suspect to be in the act of committing an arrestable offence. This is in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Criminal Law Act 1997, which provides for what used to be termed a "citizen's arrest".</p>
          <p eId="para_278">As to the right of redress for any wrongs committed by such security staff, the same position will apply as in the case of any member of the staff of private security firms that are so much part and parcel of our ordinary lives. They will be liable to be sued in the same way for trespass to the person and assault if the alleged wrongs are proved in court and so too will the company which employed them. I dare say that an inventive lawyer will also find a way to include some element of blame attaching to the State body which contracted for the service in the first place. If a member of the public has any complaint about his or her treatment, that can be followed up in the ordinary way.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I wish to confirm the position in regard to the courts and the Houses of the Oireachtas. There will be a Garda presence at all times in the courts in association with the security presence that is being provided. Equally, there will be a Garda presence in the Oireachtas. It is a question of finding a balance as to the Garda presence required in association with the security presence. The point made by Senator Cummins regarding dealing with difficult criminals and so on is not correct. Such security personnel will be accompanied in the normal way by gardaí and prison officers. We are talking about the buildings, not people who go to the courts who will be provided for in the same way.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I assure Senator Leyden that the Army presence will continue here at night as it has up to now. I take the point he made about the individuals concerned in the Oireachtas whom we have all got to know, who are excellent people and do a fine job. However, the reality is that for ten years various efforts have been made to release up to 500 gardaí from duties where it is quite clear they are not required and to deploy them on the beat where they are required. That is the purpose of this section. This is one of the better proposals I have seen in terms of Garda reform in recent years.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_281">We are not against the relieving of gardaí from duties such as this. The Minister of State referred to the deployment of extra gardaí. We were particularly in favour of the implementation of the report recommending the relieving of approximately 500 gardaí from administrative duties and that such posts would become Civil Service-type positions.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The Minister of State referred to powers under the section. It is not proposed that such personnel will have a power of arrest, but the proposed power they will have to search is significant. How many campaigns around that issue have there been in terms of its implications for infringing human rights? A person who is searched could feel that his or her personal integrity is being infringed by the searcher. Down the line people could feel their rights have been infringed. That is a significant issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The main point concerning this section is that such powers are not underpinned by the type of provisions that apply to the Garda Síochána throughout the Bill. The Minister of State is basically saying that a private firm could recruit people for this purpose, yet unlike the position that applies to the Garda Síochána, no regulations will underpin such recruitment. I have raised similar concerns regarding training. Those concerns are the main problem with this section. There are no accountability provisions regarding these people. They will have substantial powers, yet provisions in respect of similar powers apply to the Garda Síochána. That is a serious problem with this section.</p>

I was glad to hear him say there will continue to be a Garda presence within the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Courts Service and other areas. He clarified that point. He also mentioned that similar proposals were put forward in recent years but they came to nothing. These provisions will also come to nothing because the wording at the start of the section is that the Minister "may, by order" and so on. That is the way we will proceed until many of the points raised are clarified. Nothing will be done about this for a number of years.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">I do not know why the Opposition cannot see the merit of this proposal. It seems extraordinary because it is apparent to any casual observer that to have gardaí standing at these locations, while serving a function, is not serving the function for which the gardaí were recruited and trained. These tasks could be adequately carried out by officers with far less training in general Garda duties than gardaí would have.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The Minister of State has outlined this in a sensible way. I welcome that there will be Garda back-up in certain areas where it is considered necessary. However, this should be extended beyond the number of locations listed. Some 500 gardaí is a significant number. There has been much talk about increasing the size of the force and this measure would allow for a significant increase of gardaí on active duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">This type of measure should be taken because, ultimately, the public want crime tackled effectively. Any measure that provides resources to make this area more productive must be welcomed. I am surprised that members of the Opposition do not endorse this.</p>

However, he made the analogy that security officers in the relevant State bodies would have similar powers and be exposed to similar litigation to those engaged by private companies. Should they have an extra element of protection in this regard? They will train and operate on behalf of the State and there is a need to consider this aspect. Ultimately, what is wanted in this system is that security officers and gardaí operate effectively. When drafting and passing legislation, we must be mindful that we have become a litigious society so that we do not open up many avenues for some to unnecessarily pursue cases, as has happened in the past. If there was trouble in bodies such as those listed in the Bill, the emphasis of security officers has been to protect the areas for which they are responsible, particularly the assets and personnel involved. I am sure the Opposition will see the merit of this measure.</p>

With regard to Senator Tuffy's point on the indiscretion of personal searches, this is exactly what might happen to the Senator or I in any shopping centre in Dublin city. Existing security staff have the power to search us in the same way we would be searched under the new arrangement the Bill provides for.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">I am not against the idea behind this provision in terms of relieving members of the Garda Síochána from this type of duty. My problem is the issue of accountability. This is totally different to the case of security firms looking after private areas such as shopping centres. The Government is giving significant State powers to those designated security officers under the Bill. These powers would affect members of the public, including citizens who vote and visitors to the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">There is no point stating the security officers will be vetted — perhaps they will and I am sure most officers would act in a reputable way. However, there is no statutory underpinning of that vetting. Neither I nor any other Member commented in a negative way on the security industry, private security firms or anyone involved in the industry. The Minister is wrong to put that kind of spin on this. Like any profession, the majority of those who work in it are good and act in good faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The same is definitely true of the Garda Síochána. I trust the Garda Síochána but I still think — as does the Minister, in putting forward this legislation — that the force should be accountable and that there should be a legal basis for that accountability. That is the problem with this provision about which questions remain. Senator Walsh referred to litigation but listening to him one would think that anyone who takes a legal case is just out to get money. People have rights and that is why we have laws. People use the law and the courts to enforce their rights.</p>

If someone is defamed or manhandled in a shopping centre, he or she can assert his or her civil rights in court. The Bill is giving people who would operate in this way the force of a legal statute behind them. It might actually take away people's rights if they feel their reputation is being impugned.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_374">This is interesting as it deals with breach of discipline. It refers clearly to discourtesy, prevarication, abuse of authority and so on. All are part of the disciplinary code. Perhaps the Minister might amplify those issues. Gardaí have a difficult job and, in general, carry out their duties with diligence, often putting themselves at considerable risk. It is important for the effective functioning of the Garda that it has public support. That is an essential component of effective policing. Good discipline is the key to securing that support.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Corrupt or improper practices include a member placing himself or herself under a pecuniary obligation to any person by soliciting or receiving any gratuity in a manner that might affect the member's ability to discharge his or her duty. If a garda has given a particularly good service some people might feel a compunction to recognise that in some tangible way. The guidelines need to be clear as to what is proper or improper.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Perhaps the Minister might comment on the disciplinary procedures. I am sure Senator Tuffy will take me up on this, but sometimes gardaí must deal with people who try to exploit particular situations by making unjust claims against a garda for personal reasons. It is therefore important, where a claim is seen to be vexatious and without foundation, that appropriate action can be taken against individuals who make false claims. The Garda Síochána is a disciplined force and in carrying out its duties gardaí are open to false allegations being made against them. Anybody making such false allegations must also be taken to account. As the Minister said earlier, balance is a very important component of this Bill, and it is obviously necessary in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">Schedule 5 is a repeat of the existing disciplinary code, which the Minister will review in conjunction with the Garda Síochána representative bodies. The area of disciplinary procedures will be reviewed in light of the provisions of the Bill. Section 102 deals with the question of false claims. I assure the Senator that those issues will be dealt with in that context.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">In the event of a very serious accident involving a tram, bus or a train at one of our many unguarded level crossings, the person driving the car or lorry that might have caused the accident might believe he or she is adequately covered only to find the insurance company has set a ceiling that does not cover such an accident. The concern is that this might put his or her home or private property at risk. I understand the point made by the Minister and his officials that because of the capping, this could not occur. If it were to happen an assurance has been be given that it would need to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas. We need more dialogue and debate with the companies and IBEC, which were not consulted on the matter. It would be unimaginable to pass legislation that would put people's homes at risk.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_393">I would like to put down some markers, which might help Senators understand the background to this provision. The proposal does not of itself change the present requirement for unlimited third-party cover for road accident personal injuries. The section proposes a mechanism for change if change becomes necessary in the future. No change is being made to the existing provision of unlimited third-party cover. My officials inform me that sooner rather than later unlimited cover will cease to be available from insurance companies because their reinsurers, the underwriters, will not give them unlimited cover in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">As the law stands at present, motorists would be breaking the law if they used their vehicles in a public place without unlimited cover. As a result some other requirement for insurance must replace the unlimited cover as it becomes available. A limit on cover could not be put in place unless both Houses of the Oireachtas approve the regulations proposing such a substitute arrangement as well as the amount of the limit. As has been said before, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport would have an important role in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">As one who started my career in insurance, I have some knowledge of the industry. My personal preference and that of most people would be for unlimited liability cover for personal injuries, which is the ideal level of cover in respect of accidents. While that is a fair position to hold, we must take account of the developing practicalities in the real world where insurance companies will no longer provide unlimited cover. If that is the position, this proposal will allow a mechanism to ensure that people will be able to continue to obtain insurance cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The Senator raised a fair issue about the level. In a major accident involving, for example, a tram or a train, nobody wants to have only a limited level of cover that would not meet that requirement. My officials have informed me that the level, if it is to be limited, will still be in multiples of millions of euro, so that it will cover any unforeseen accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The Law Society has written opposing the amendment on the grounds that——</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_399">It opposes the proposal with regard to badly injured persons who may be unable to recover the full amount of compensation to which they would be legally entitled. Insurance persons found negligent would suffer financial ruin. Those were the two main points raised by the Law Society.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The society also asked whether, if the provision is enacted, it would have an opportunity to make submissions and meet the Minister before any regulations are made. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, and I have indicated a commitment to openness and transparency in this matter. Before any regulations to impose a limit are introduced and take effect, they will be open to the full scrutiny of the Dáil and Seanad and we will meet any interested groups in respect of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I do not see how any limit I may propose might be at a level that would give rise to the situations outlined by Senator Paddy Burke or the Law Society. Whatever limit is put in place, it should always be sufficient to cover any accident that may occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">At Christmas 2002, a provider of an important support service to one of our main airports was refused unlimited cover for a certain aspect of its operations. The insurance company involved was, however, prepared to offer cover at a level of €1.7 billion. I envisage that a figure of this kind will apply should a specific limit ever be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I hope my comments have been of assistance to Senator Paddy Burke and other Members. Senators Wilson and Dooley took the opportunity before I entered the House to ask me a couple of relevant questions on this matter and I appreciate their concerns, which they did not take the opportunity to place on the record at this stage. I hope what I have said will clarify matters.</p>

I welcome the fact that a person's house or property cannot be seized because he or she might not be fully insured.</p>

Four main speed limits will be put in place as a result of the enactment of this legislation as follows: the 50 km/h which will replace the 30 mph limit; the new 80 km/h limit; the 100 km/h which will replace the existing 60 mph limit on national primary and secondary routes; and the 120 km/h limit which will replace the 70 mph limit on motorways. These new limits will prove extremely confusing for motorists whose speedometers have not been converted to kilometres per hour.</p>

I hope the campaign will commence immediately after Christmas because the new limits will be confusing for members of the public.</p>

A number of issues created concerns for us and the Minister of State addressed them exceptionally well. There is no doubt that this Bill is an important addition to the range of legislation relating to road safety and road management that has come before the House in the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The House regularly discusses the loss of life on our roads. Notwithstanding what could be considered as a blip in the current statistics, there is little doubt that the work the Department, officials and various Ministers have done has led to a considerable decrease in the past ten years in the number of people killed on the roads. Some aggressive targets have been set via the road safety strategy and legislation such as that before us and we hope the provisions set out in the Bill will ensure that these are met. The costs incurred by people, the health service and society in general as a result of road deaths are tremendous. All Members would want to strive to ensure that we complete our work in this area.</p>

The level of traffic and the number of deaths on our roads must be kept to the fore. We must ensure that the latter is reduced. The Bill will definitely prove to be of assistance in that regard.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_419">I thank all Members of the House for their assistance in passing the Bill and challenging me on certain aspects of it. This is important legislation and I am pleased that it has passed all Stages in both Houses and will now be sent to the President for enactment.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The Bill deals with the change from imperial to metric speed limits, outsourcing and insurance issues. All three areas were well debated. I take Senator Dooley's point about a person buying something in good faith to be used by a minor off the road, an area I will ask my officials to examine. I would not like to see an innocent parent or guardian who buys something for fun getting caught in a loophole. Mechanically propelled vehicles are sometimes bought as Christmas presents for minors and we do not want such a situation to be covered by the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">There were many questions yesterday on the change from imperial to metric speed limits. Much work has gone into the changeover, which will be done in a similar fashion to the euro changeover. The metrication changeover board is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from the National Safety Council, the National Roads Authority, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Automobile Association, the Local Authority Managers Association, the Garda Síochána, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and Professor Ray Fuller of Trinity College. A public awareness campaign is planned from early January and there will be publicity in the national and local press, as well as on national and local television and radio. We will also send an explanatory package to every house in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The Bill will help the Government to implement the road safety strategy. I referred yesterday to the number of deaths on the roads and we are concerned about the increase in 2004 over 2003. The overall comparison, however, with road deaths in the 1990s shows that in real terms the numbers of fatalities have fallen.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Equally, I am concerned that in the first week of the road safety campaign for the festive season, there was a large increase in the number of people detected driving while under the influence of drink. That is a source of concern because the two main factors in road accidents are speed and driving while intoxicated. As we make progress with the campaign on the changeover to metric speed limits, I will welcome feedback from those who want to support the campaign and who might have proposals for their local area.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members of the House for their accommodation. On behalf of the Minister and on my own behalf, I wish everyone a happy, holy and peaceful Christmas.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_232">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. S. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_425">I am pleased to introduce the Social Welfare Bill 2004, the first of two Bills which will implement the social welfare package of €874 million announced in last week's budget. The package represents an increase of €244 million, or almost 40%, on the 2004 package of €630 million. It brings the projected level of social welfare expenditure for 2005 to over €12.25 billion, which constitutes an increase of €1 billion, or almost 9%, on the allocation for 2004. That it is the highest ever level of social welfare expenditure is an indication of the Government's priority, which is to protect and improve the living standards of social welfare recipients, as well as a clear demonstration of its commitment to addressing the needs of people with disabilities, their carers, children, the elderly, widowed persons, the unemployed, those who are parenting alone and disadvantaged and vulnerable people who are on the margins of society. The package continues the Government's substantial annual increases in social welfare expenditure, which has increased by almost 60% in the last four years. The current level of such expenditure is twice that in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The budget of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is over €12 billion, is the largest spending allocation of any Department. I wish to elaborate on what that means in real terms. For every €3 that will be spent by the Government in 2005, almost €1 will be spent on social welfare payments. An estimated 970,000 people are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments next year. When one takes dependants into account, almost 1.5 million people, or two out of every five people in the State, will benefit from welfare supports. The increases of €12 and €14 in weekly social welfare payments are three to four times greater than the expected rate of inflation in 2005. The increases range from over 7% to over 10%, compared to next year's expected rate of inflation of 2.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Ireland has changed dramatically for the better since the Government took office. The number of people at work has increased to almost 1.9 million, the rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to 4.4% and the number of low-paid workers removed from the tax net has increased. Those on the minimum wage will be taken out of the income tax net entirely in 2005. Social welfare spending has more than doubled, from €5.74 billion in 1997 to a projected €12.25 billion in 2005. Gross average industrial earnings have increased by 71% in the past decade, but social welfare payments have increased by between 87% and 95%, and by even more for larger families. Substantial improvements in the conditions for entitlement to a range of social welfare schemes and services have been implemented. New social welfare benefits, such as farm assist, carer's benefit, the widowed parent grant and the respite care grant, have been introduced and enhanced. All the real social welfare improvements have led to a significant reduction in consistent poverty in recent years. According to the ESRI, the overall level of consistent poverty in 1998 was 8.2%. This was reduced by over a third, to 5.2%, by 2001, the latest year for which figures are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I could spend a long time citing more facts and figures to confirm the pivotal role played by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in the lives of many people and the great strides made in recent years. The Department is concerned with more than statistics, however. The payments, benefits and supports it provides to almost 1 million people are a weekly lifeline for many of those who struggle to make ends meet. The Department is often the last safety net for those descending towards poverty, marginalisation and economic and social distress. It is more than an efficient and effective administrative structure for processing and delivering State entitlements, however, as it needs to be people-centred, above all else. The Department must continue to shape the welfare system to meet individual needs. That will be the Department's guiding principle under my stewardship. It will react and respond speedily and sympathetically to those who reach out for a welfare lifeline. It will not be guided only by rules and regulations that sometimes blur the real purpose. I remind Senators that a one-size welfare system does not fit everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">While the Department of Social and Family Affairs represents a valuable source of payments, entitlements and supports, it must be viewed in a broader context. It is concerned with the welfare and the overall well-being of those who are caught in a daily struggle to make ends meet, including children at risk of poverty, carers who look after those unable to care for themselves, the elderly, the unemployed and many others to whom we must reach out and support. The Department must constantly monitor the pulse of our changing society and broaden and evolve to respond to changes. The economic surge of the Celtic tiger era did not raise all boats — some people were left behind, for whatever reason. The rising tide must lift those who were left behind on the previous occasion during the new wave of economic growth we are enjoying.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Before I outline the contents of the Bill, I wish to mention some of the welfare areas that were targeted specifically in the budget, in which I have tried to recognise and support in a special way the contribution carers make to society. Like everyone else, Senators are aware of the commitments and sacrifices involved in the work of carers, who provide a valued and valuable service. The package of measures I agreed with the Minister for Finance commits additional spending of almost €40 million to enhance supports for carers and to allow more carers to qualify for entitlements. Carers will benefit from eight separate increases or improvements as a result of this year's budget. Carer's allowance and carer's benefit will increase by €14 per week and the annual respite care grant will increase from €850 to €1,000. Almost 33,000 full-time carers are expected to receive the latter grant next year. The grant has been extended to include all carers who provide full-time care, subject to employment-related conditions, thereby recognising and acknowledging the challenges faced by carers who care for several people. Some 9,200 full-time carers will receive the grant for the first time as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The carer's package expands the income limits for carer's allowance, so that all those on average industrial incomes can qualify, by increasing the weekly means test income disregard by €20 to €270 for a single person and by €40 to €540 for a couple. A couple with two children can earn up to €30,700 and receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance, while the same couple can earn up to €49,200 and receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance, free travel, the household benefits package of free schemes and the respite care grant. These improvements will result in an additional 1,000 new carers qualifying for payment and 2,400 existing carers, who are currently in receipt of a reduced payment, receiving an increase in their weekly carer's allowance payment. I am committed to the cause of carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The most recent budget, with previous initiatives, went some distance in responding to the specific needs of carers. It was my first budget as Minister for Social and Family Affairs, just as it was Deputy Cowen's first budget as Minister for Finance. There will be further opportunities to address the needs of carers and I look forward to taking them. I will continue to meet and listen to carers to shape the entitlements and supports that are most vital to the valuable work they perform. A lot has been done but, as the cliché goes, there is more to do. I assure the House that we will work towards recognising and rewarding carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Let us consider what the Opposition has labelled as "cuts". These were introduced last year and I have been reviewing them since I became Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Some of the 30 or so groups involved in making pre-budget submissions told me that several measures needed easement. With that in mind and following detailed examination, I decided to amend and ease nine of the measures at this time, while instructing that those remaining should be subjected to a continuing active review.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">To remove any lingering doubts, I want to make it very clear that significant improvements have been made in the following ways. As an employment incentive, I have arranged that the one-parent family payment will be restored and will continue to include a half-rate transitional payment for six months when employment paying over €293 per week is gained. The weekly income threshold for half-rate child dependant allowance in respect of certain benefits has been increased from €300 to €350.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The qualifying period for the back to education third level option has been reduced from 15 months to 12 months. As I stated in the Dáil last night, I am sympathetic to considering a further reduction in the qualifying period in this regard, perhaps to nine months. The qualifying period for entry into second level education has not changed and remains at six months. As a further boost in this area, the cost of the back to education allowance has been amended by increasing the grant from €254 to €400.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I have made major changes regarding rent supplement. The six-month rule has been abolished and replaced by a new criterion such that those with a short-term income need will not be disadvantaged. This applies to cases of illness or unemployment, together with those who are assessed by a local authority as having a housing need, the elderly, homeless people and those who are disabled. Previously, rent supplement was not paid to those who refused two offers of local authority accommodation. I have raised this to three offers, which I believe to be reasonable in order to strengthen the leadership role of local authorities in dealing with long-term housing needs. To that end, I will be having discussions with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, on how best to ensure housing assessments are carried out in a speedier fashion for all applicants for rent supplement. I increased the income disregard from €50 to €60 per week for the payment of rent supplement and have decided not to increase the relevant minimum contribution of claimants from the present rate €13 per week. I have asked the social partners to examine the non-payment of rent supplement where one member of a couple is in full-time employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service is a significant contributor to anti-poverty measures. I have recognised this by providing in this year's budget special funding of €700,000 so the service can develop additional services in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The purpose of the crèche supplement is to provide short-term emergency support in cases such as those in which a parent has a medical appointment. I have ensured that existing recipients continue to receive the supplement and that new cases referred by health professionals will be able to receive payment. I will be consulting my Cabinet colleagues on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Correct diet is important for many people who have particular medical needs and I have therefore restored payment of the dietary supplement, with immediate effect. Given that it is some years since diets were last comprehensively assessed, my Department has commissioned a study by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute on the most appropriate diets over and above normal food costs. I will study that report.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The remaining measures will be continuously monitored to ensure that there is no disadvantage caused. These include graduated rates of payment and the increase in paid contributions for entitlement to certain social insurance benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">It is a sad fact of life that, more often than not, the most vulnerable of the vulnerable in society are children. This budget set out to further improve entitlements and supports targeted at directly benefiting children and families. I know there has been some questioning of the policy of not increasing the child dependant allowances on the grounds that these payments are made only to recipients of social welfare. The Government's policy is to concentrate resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">After the budget, child benefit will account for over 66% of child income support, while in 1994 it constituted less than 30%. There are sound reasons for this policy. Child benefit is more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the child’s parents and it does not contribute to poverty traps whereas the loss of child dependant allowances might do so. As Senators are aware, child benefit is a near-universal payment. They will appreciate that the child dependant allowance had not been changed since 1994, but the view of successive Governments is that child benefit represents a better way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">As part of Sustaining Progress, special initiatives are being taken to end child poverty. Payments that would replace the family income supplement and child dependant allowance, and perhaps the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, are being considered. Perhaps we can put a new scheme in place. I am particularly interested in studying the findings of the NESC report on child poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">My priority in this budget package is to make significant progress in delivering on the social welfare commitments contained in the programme for Government, Sustaining Progress and the national anti-poverty strategy. We are focusing our resources on the relevant areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Sections 2 and 3 reaffirm the Government's commitment to supporting pensioners. The Bill provides for an increase of €12 per week in the personal pension rates, increasing the rate of old age contributory pension to €179.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension to €166 per week. This is a real increase of over three and a half times the rate of inflation. There is also an increase of €12 for those in receipt of widow's and widower's contributory and non-contributory pensions. Widows aged under 66 who are in receipt of those pensions will benefit from a €14 increase, bringing their weekly pensions to €154.30 and €148.80, respectively. Proportionate increases will be applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Proportionate increases apply to qualified adult rates across the board to match the other increases. These increases are already on the record of the Houses. I am conscious of the needs of other vulnerable groups in our society, particularly those who are unemployed, disadvantaged or ill, and those who provide care for the elderly and the ill. Accordingly, I am providing for a weekly increase of €14 in the personal rates that apply in this regard. The rate of carer's allowance will reach €153.60 per week while the new carer's benefit rate will be €163.70 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The social welfare increases included in this Bill will become payable from the first pay day in January 2005. Some 160,000 customers who receive long-term payments by means of electronic payment through a post office will receive their increases on the first pay day in January. Obviously, there are some administration issues to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The production of new order books will entail a minimal delay, and the new books will be issued to all customers in mid-February 2005. These customers will receive a lump sum arrears payment covering a period of six weeks in their first payable order of the new book, and the weekly increase will be included in their weekly payable orders thereafter. A further 260,000 customers will receive their new order books in April. To minimise inconvenience, they will, however, receive a special arrears payment in mid-February, covering the previous six weeks, and seven weeks advance payment. I trust this will be helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Section 4 provides an increase of €39 in the weekly income thresholds applied in determining entitlement to family income supplement. This could mean a weekly increase of €23.40 for most eligible families. Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill provide for changes to the PRSI structure. Section 7 of the Bill provides for changes to maternity and adoptive benefits. We are meeting substantially our commitments under Sustaining Progress to raise the limit in respect of these benefits to 80% of average weekly earnings over the life of that agreement. This measure will benefit the majority of recipients and will take effect from January 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Section 8 provides for an increase of €44 per week in the health contribution threshold, thereby increasing the weekly income under which no contribution is payable from €365 per week, or €18,512 per year, to €400 per week, or €20,800 per year. This measure, which will take effect from January 2005, will benefit some 95,000 income earners.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">This Social Welfare Bill, the first of two instalments, builds further on the progression of social inclusion measures adopted by this Government over recent years. It safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare income and other supports and prioritises the allocation of resources in favour of those most in need. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_233">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_452">I welcome the Minister to the House. The Social Welfare Bill certainly represents a welcome change to the image of the Government. I compliment the Minister on his input to the Bill, which makes many changes that are of benefit to many people. I recognise the changes he has made to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It is a change from last year's budget which did nothing but hit the most vulnerable in our society. I welcome the fact that this Bill recognises them and changes are afoot to improve the lot of many people. While a great deal more needs to be done I believe that with this Minister at the helm things will continue to improve. I acknowledge and welcome some of the positive aspects of this Bill but I must also point out areas where changes could be made to improve social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I welcome the removal of all national minimum wage earners from the tax net. Despite changes to the tax bands 33% of working people will continue to pay tax at the higher rate. I would like to see some changes to that in the coming years. I welcome the minimum social welfare rate increase and the increase in the non-contributory old age pension. While this is welcome it is lower than was expected, therefore more must be done in the next two years. I also welcome the funding package for people with disabilities and the child benefit increases but more remains to be done in this area to meet the commitment given in Sustaining Progress. Why did the Minister not give a further increase this year? Is he saving the large increase for the year before the general election? It must be given out and could be phased in gradually rather than given as a lump sum or larger increase in the final year which I suspect will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Some of the dreadful cuts made in last year's Bill had a serious impact on very vulnerable families. The Minister has addressed some of those but he has played around with them rather than reversing them although the impression is given that they have been reversed. For example, the qualifying period for the back to education allowance was six months until 2004 when it was increased to 15 months. Now the Minister has put it back to 12 months. While I recognise that he is examining this, I fear he may bring it back to nine months rather than six. The initial advice and consultation leading to the introduction of the allowance was that any period longer than six months was retrogressive. Will the Minister consider reversing that cut?</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The transitional half-rate payment for lone parents seems to be only a 50% reversal. In 2004 the transitional half-rate payment for lone parents was to be discontinued where a recipient of one parent family payment took up employment and earned more than the upper threshold of €293 per week. The Minister has amended that by saying one parent family payment recipients are to receive transitional half-rate payment for six months where income exceeds €293 per week. Prior to the cutback transitional half rate payments were given for 12 months. This was a very petty measure. Before the cutback only 580 people claimed this payment but six months after its introduction 120 people were taken off the scheme. What is the figure now?</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I welcome some of the changes to the rent supplement scheme but some are ambiguous. According to some voluntary groups that have contacted us, this change means that an individual must prove some form of renting, not necessarily for six months but this amendment does not cover lone parents or people living at home with their parents who want to move out. These people are the most at risk and need to be independent and move out on their own. What form of renting will people be expected to prove to qualify for this scheme?</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The special funding of €700,000 to the Money Advice and Budgeting Service is not a full reinstatement of the original cutback. Prior to the cutback this measure cost €700,000 per year; now, instead of reversing this payment, the Government is giving a once-off payment of the same amount but only 370 people availed of it. I welcome the Minister's reversal of the cutback in the diet supplement. However, I am concerned that he has commissioned a report which may suggest a reduction or restriction of this supplement. Why does the Minister feel another report is necessary?</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The changes to the child dependant allowance are not a reversal for everyone who was receiving this before the 2004 cuts. By June of this year, six months after the introduction of this cutback, the number of people receiving such a payment was reduced by 17,000, from 63,000 to 46,000. In his press release on budget day the Minister claimed that his amendment would benefit approximately 4,600 families. This is a 30% reversal, and the figure could be much worse given that the latest available figures for this cutback cover only the first six months of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Several organisations have contacted Senators with their responses to the budget, many of which were complimentary. Nevertheless, they point to some areas where further improvements could have been made and I agree with those. Community Platform, a collective of 26 national organisations, working against poverty and inequality, stated that the budget was a relatively positive one for adults but it completely ignored the needs of children, especially those living in poverty. It stated the Minister failed to meet the Sustaining Progress commitment on child benefit and should have given €18 to the first and second children. Sharon Keane of Community Platform said: "This Government continues to ignore the 66,000 children it acknowledges are living in poverty. . . . This is the second Minister for Finance in succession to break this promise."</p>
          <p eId="para_460">She added that the lack of affordable child care places a significant burden on working parents and must be tackled as a priority. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has announced a package on child care. That is a major issue which is not directly within the remit of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs although he is probably trying to deal with it under child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The lack of affordable child care is a significant issue that I would like to see the Government tackle at the earliest opportunity. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has said that child benefit falls short of the Government's own commitment to reach €149 per month in this budget and pushes out the fulfilment of that commitment to the 2006 budget. I agree that it should have increased child benefit this year by more.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">The child dependant portion of the social welfare payments has remained frozen for the 11th year in a row, although eligibility has been widened so that 4,600 extra families will qualify. I cannot understand why, over the past 11 years, that payment has not been increased. The families who get it are the most vulnerable. Not all families will benefit from the changes that the Minister has made this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">There has been no increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, something that I find surprising. There is a problem of some families not claiming it, but we can make people aware of the benefits to which they are entitled through the media. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has said that there has been no increase in the qualified adult allowance and that it should be increased from €89.40 per week to €104.86. It also said that social housing had been virtually ignored, with the €66 million allocated providing for only 250 extra social housing units in 2005. That comes at a time when there are 48,000 households on waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I wish to again address the issue of child benefit. If we are serious about tackling child poverty, many of the organisations that have contacted us have said the best way to do so is to increase child benefit. The budget offers little hope for the 6,000 men, women and children living in homeless accommodation of ever moving into their own homes. The Children's Rights Alliance has said that child benefit is the principal financial vehicle for supporting families with children. It is also at the heart of the Government's plan to eliminate child poverty. Both objectives — supporting families with children and ending child poverty by 2007 — have been seriously undermined by the Government's failure to keep its promises to raise the amount to €150. Furthermore, policy practice continues to refuse to increase child dependant allowance targeted at families with children in receipt of welfare. The Minister is missing a golden opportunity to move thousands of children out of poverty and improve the lives of thousands more. Those choices are made at the expense of the rights and needs of children. We need to tackle child poverty in this day and age when the country is so well off. We are all aware of many children living in poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The increase in the family income supplement is not enough and, worse still, is not reaching those who need it. Only 12,000 people are getting family income supplement, but any survey of the income figures will show that at least three times as many should be getting it. What can we do to ensure that those families who deserve it get it? Why is it not paid through the tax code, which would at least guarantee that it would reach those who need it?</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I welcome the increase in the respite care grant. Also welcome is the removal of the anomaly whereby a person caring for more than two people did not receive the grant for each care recipient. It is about time that was removed. The income disregard for the carer's allowance will result in an additional 1,000 carers qualifying for the payment. The number of carers receiving the carer's allowance will increase from 23,500 in 2004 to 24,500 in 2005. However, it is believed that there are at least 50,000 carers in the country. How do we reach them and ensure that they get what they are entitled to?</p>
          <p eId="para_467">I have more to say, but I will have to yield to others who wish to speak. This does not concern the Bill directly. I thank the Minister for attending the House recently to discuss occupational pension schemes. I welcome the fact that in the budget the Minister did not mention any move to let the pensions industry get its hands on the SSIAs. However, the Minister said that he might examine other ways of encouraging people to take out their own occupational pensions, but in such a way that their pensions are protected.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MargaretCox" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_468">I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to the House. I will start with the suggestion that Fianna Fáil has adopted a new image and has apparently made a miraculous conversion to giving to the people. In the context of total spending on welfare, which has more than doubled since 1997, it is a joke to make such a suggestion. If the Government had suddenly found its feet this year and started giving money to everyone through the social welfare budget, it would be fair to criticise us and say that the decision was perhaps only for perception or image.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">However, that is not what this party and Government are about. Fianna Fáil is the republican party, and part of that ethos concerns looking after and providing for those in need. We must ensure that we create a system and economy that are sustainable and will allow us to continue giving and looking after people not able to catch up with those doing very well. I speak of the most vulnerable, such as children who live in poverty. The Fianna Fáil republican image and ethos concern the creation of an environment that allows those children living in poverty to get the education and jobs that they need to get out of it. That way, they do not continue in a rat trap circle of poverty where they know nothing else and, if they have children themselves, the same is true of them. That is not what the Government is about. I am delighted to be able to reject completely the idea that it did not care about people before and that the social welfare budget, representing the largest sum ever spent on the sector — an increase of 8.8% up to €12.25 billion — is merely part of the new image of Fianna Fáil. It is not; it is what we are about.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I congratulate the Minister who was recently appointed to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. If we had examined his bona fides before his appointment we would have recognised that he is probably one of the few Ministers to have saved the lives of ten, 20 or even 30 Irish people in his previous job, by introducing penalty points. He showed a determination in his attitude to that issue that, if replicated in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, will lead to another budget and Social Welfare Bill next year with which we can be happy. It will continue to look to the future and provide for those who most need help.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I will move on to some of the specifics. One of the great things about a budget like the one recently announced includes having the money to pay for it and put it into services. This gives us the opportunity to see what we can do next, given that we were unable to do it all on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">What are the issues about which we need to be concerned? I wish to focus on child benefit, to which the Minister and Senator Terry referred. The rate of child benefit payable in respect of four children is €637 per month. That payment is generally paid directly to the mother and is directly focused on the cost of looking after the children. It is a benefit that needs to be protected and retained. We need to ensure that it continues to increase. My view on child benefit is probably different from that of the Minister. I do not believe it is the way to deal with the cost of child care for parents who are working. That is a mistake we are making. Continuing to increase child benefit for that reason is a mistake. We need to do something different.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">If one has four children of varying ages where they need child care, they may be in part-time care, or a full-time carer, a child minder, may come to one's house to look after them. One's children are the most important part of one's life and the reason one gets up in the morning to go out to make a living to provide for them. If one pays a child minder an appropriate wage of between €16,000 and €20,000 and employer's PRSI on top of that, which is another 10%, one spends €23,000 per annum of one's income in respect of which tax has been deducted on child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">If one is employing a person to look after one's children, that person should be paid a proper wage, covered by the social welfare system and be able to build up stamps to provide for his or her future. If a person is caring for three or four children in his or her own home, perhaps some disregard could be introduced. Children are the central part of our country, society and culture. Perhaps we could decide to do something different in respect of the cost of child care. In this context, child benefit is not the answer. It is not dealing with the real issues, including the cost of child care. We discussed this issue previously here. Some people pay more in child care expenses than their mortgage repayment. That means something is wrong. I plead with the Minister to bring the message back to Cabinet that child benefit is important. It does a wonderful job and is succeeding in its objective, but it is not the answer to providing a solution to the cost of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Another issue I wish to raise, which was discussed during the debate on pensions, is that of the treatment of women's pension rights. We need to continue to make improvements in that area. I will leave it at that.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The rule that a recipient can receive only one payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs is becoming more of an issue. A person in receipt of widow's or widower's pension, which represents that person's only income, who is looking after an older person, a near relative, a mother-in-law or father-in-law cannot qualify for the carer's allowance. If that person's partner was still alive and in receipt of a pension, an income disregard of approximately €250 per week would apply and that carer would qualify for carer's allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">It does not make sense to have in place a blanket ban that precludes widows or other recipients in receipt of a payment from the Department from receiving a second payment, particularly in the case of carers. The rule particularly disadvantages women and widows because they tend to have more caring roles such as looking after older people in their homes. If a person has been widowed, that person may not have been the chief bread winner in the family and may be totally dependent on the widow's pension. I plead with the Minister to reconsider this issue to see if something can be done in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">One of the most intelligent and proactive measures introduced by the previous Government was carer's benefit and carer's leave. It provides that a person can take time off to look after a person who is ill. The carer's employment rights are maintained and he or she can be paid carer's benefit through the Department of Social and Family Affairs. However, the process involved is still bureaucratic. One has to apply for leave before one can apply for the benefit and complete the necessary forms. Generally, the people who want to apply for this benefit and leave want to do so for the short term. The person may wish to look after a person who has been diagnosed as being terminally ill and may not have many months left to live. The carer may have been working and everything may have been fine but suddenly he or she is faced with dealing with the likely death of a loved one in difficult circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The carer wants to look after this person, to take the time off, but to do so he or she must complete all the necessary forms and jump through all the hoops. We need to make the process simpler, which it would be easy to do. The Department is getting better on a weekly basis at making the system simple. Will the Minister ensure this process is reconsidered by his Department in association with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, given that one has to make an application to one Department and then apply to the other Department for the payment. Therefore, the process is complex. It should be reviewed to ensure an applicant is required to complete only one application and submit his or her PPS number. On receipt of that application, one should be advised if one is entitled to the benefit and, if one is, one will get it, following which one is automatically entitled to the leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The Department is great in the manner in which it deals with its clients on a daily basis. People are informed by letter of their rights. If a person's circumstances change and he or she is not claiming all the benefits to which he or she is entitled, the person will receive a letter to that effect. I had a recent case where a person in receipt of disability benefit received a letter from the Department. That person has been in receipt of that benefit for a period and it was clear that the person would not be able to return to work. The letter from the Department advised that the person might want to go on to disability pension with its advantages. That was fantastic. The person moved from a position of being in receipt of disability benefit to being in receipt of disability pension and now qualifies for free travel and a number of other benefits, including a medical card, to none of which that person was previously entitled. It was due to the proactive approach of the Department that this person was so advised.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I wish to focus on two issues. I am concerned about the issue of social welfare fraud. With all the changes that have taken place in our system during recent years, opportunities are being exploited by individuals to defraud the social welfare system. People are selling their PPS numbers. One can get a PPS number legitimately and then sell it on to somebody. Most employers tend to ask an employee for a PPS number rather than a visa number or a work permit. Fraud such as that is happening throughout the country and it needs to be stopped. If we are to have robust and fair social welfare system, it must be fair for everybody and not open exploitation and abuse. The Minister has dealt with this issue in the past and it has been dealt with by previous Ministers in this Department, but we need to make sure that people are not exploiting and abusing our social welfare system. The people who lose out in the end are the people who need to be provided for by the social welfare system.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The issue of paid parental leave is another measure I would like included in the shopping basket, so to speak. I would like some payment to be made available in the future to parents who take parental leave. Such a payment might not apply for the entire period but it should cover a portion of it. It could cover initially four weeks, then a further eight weeks and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Parental leave is vital. It is an important type of leave for parents and their children. If we were to introduce an initiative that was focused on protecting children and giving them a better start in life, it would be in the area of parental leave. Many of us may have good jobs and a good income and may not notice the loss of income while on such leave because we pay the top rate of tax. When we reduce our income we would not lose that much money because we would make a saving in terms of tax. However, it would be helpful if people on lower incomes who want to take parental leave could be given payment during such leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The Bill is excellent. I commend the Minister on the work he has done. He has put his stamp on the Department in a short time. I look forward to seeing what will come forward in terms of such legislation in 2006 and 2007. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_485">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on his new appointment and welcome him to the House for this important debate. While some elements of the budget were very much needed and are welcome, I do not agree with other elements of it and may concentrate on those for the larger part of my contribution. Overall, there has been a welcome increase in spend and a concentration on people with disabilities, however, other areas must be considered with a view to effecting real change by providing resources and finance to areas where it is clearly lacking.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">It was the first budget of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and like other Ministers for Finance, it was his first major hurdle. I do not envy his task in attempting to redress some of the issues left for him to deal with following the departure of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to Brussels. The former Minister introduced seven budgets, some of which by and large favoured one section of society over others. Trying to overcome the gap thereby created was a serious challenge for the new Minister, Deputy Cowen, and one he did not take lightly. Given this, he is to be congratulated for arriving at the other side of his first budget and addressing some of the issues which needed to be addressed. However, he needs to consider areas that have been neglected.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">There are two budgets to come in the lifetime of this Government. I hope we do not return to the system that was manipulated by the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who saved the largesse, went on a shopping spree, bought votes for the last election and within one week of the new Government being formed sent memos to Secretaries General of Departments telling them to claw back on spending. I hope this is a practice the new Minister for Finance will not pursue. To say the least, it is cynical and not good for democracy or the body politic.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Some tough decisions must be made in regard to who will be looked after. Should we look after the horse fraternity or the less well-off in society? In that context, as I stated in regard to two previous Bills brought forward by the former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, I must refer to a wonderful body of people, namely, carers. It is difficult to quantify the service provided by carers because they care for loved ones and those who are less well-off than most, for whatever reason. They do not qualify for holidays or annual leave, do not have the same rights as organised labour-intensive workplaces and do not earn overtime.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The ministerial record of the new Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, will be judged on whether he abolishes the means test for carers. I realise this will be expensive but it must be done. We cannot afford not to do it. It would provide significant resources for carers in terms of the financial assistance which is clearly needed but also by reducing the burden on them. The benefit to the State will dramatically outweigh any trepidation that might exist in terms of the cost. If what the Minister stated to Ursula Halligan on "The Political Party" is true, it is a challenge the Minister must meet and his record will be judged on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Carers are a wonderful group. They are in every town and village and there is no area where the care they provide is not needed. As a group, they are slowly organising themselves in terms of co-ordinating meetings, swapping ideas and offering assistance and advice. In my area of west Cork, there is an active group of carers made up of people who by their very nature are selfless. The abolition of the means test is a measure which must be quickly introduced. I am surprised it was not introduced in this budget and hope it will be in the next. I realise many groups lobby the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and much wise advice is available to him. However, if he makes what will be a revolutionary move, history will perhaps judge him with kindness. It is like supposed comment of de Valera from the film "Michael Collins" that, "History will record the greatness of Collins and it will be recorded at my expense". However, this is a worthy and deserving cause and this change needs to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The budget increases were welcome and the increase of €14 in social welfare payments is significant. However, this must be considered in context. The savage 16 cuts were introduced during the reign of the former Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and had an adverse effect in a number of areas. For example, it was a retrograde step to alter the criteria for the back to education allowance. The key to effectively dealing with poverty is by tackling disadvantage in education. This means providing the opportunity to allow those in receipt of social welfare to return to the education system where they will obtain a standard of education and skills based on that before entering the workplace. There is a kickback for the State in terms of the fact that most will then pay tax at the higher rates. Therefore, the Exchequer earns some dividend in regard to that scheme. It is not an area that should be starved of finances but which needs more finance and initiative. Any attempts made to dismantle it were retrograde.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Senator Cox referred to another outstanding issue, that of child care. It is a huge burden on the many young couples who work morning, noon and night to pay mortgages and child minders. While I am not sure of the best way to tackle the issue, we could use the tax system to militate positively in favour of those who need assistance with child care. The tax system could be used for this in the same way it is used to allow others to take advantage of the system in terms of the ten millionaires who pay no tax, although I accept they correctly and properly do not pay tax due to the current system. It is critically important that a similar system is used to allow parents a fair opportunity in terms of child care and a genuine opportunity to work, provide a good home and access child care based on need and financial capacity. It is a serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Many other issues will be raised during this debate in the coming days. I look forward to putting down amendments on Committee Stage, particularly in regard to the means test for carer's allowance. As long as the means test is in existence, I will keep raising the issue in the House with the relevant Minister and at different fora. It is an emotive issue and one which runs to the heart of every family in this country. I will put down an amendment on Committee Stage to reflect this and hope the Minister will consider it favourably. I urge the Minister to reconsider the issue of carers and the other issues raised, and to have a sympathetic ear on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I am grateful to this House for affording me the opportunity to report on the progress made last week on the Northern Ireland peace process. I would like to explain why the recent developments are important.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">It is my belief that we have reached the final, difficult phase of our peace process. I have heard some people say that things are quiet in Northern Ireland and that we should leave well enough alone. In my view, however, this would be an entirely wrong approach. We must continue, in every way that we can, with the efforts to try and bring agreement and final closure all round. I was privileged to have been part of history at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. It is now my responsibility and duty to make history work fairly and well for everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The proposals we published last week cover key issues that must be resolved to finally and definitively assure peace and political stability in Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Blair and I had obviously wished to be able to present our proposals in the context of full agreement but we are not quite at the point of total success. Our work will, therefore, continue to secure closure on what, by any standard, is a landmark package.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Since the devolved institutions were suspended in October 2002, there have been two previous intensive negotiations designed to achieve a comprehensive agreement that delivered acts of completion on all sides. They were not wholly successful but each, in its own way, pushed the process forward and helped to bring us today to the point where completion is achievable.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">When the results of last year's election became known, many believed that it would never be possible for the two main parties involved to work together. I did not share that pessimism. Following my meeting with the DUP at our embassy in London in January this year — the first such meeting between the DUP leadership and the Government on political matters — I was convinced that the DUP recognised this responsibility and wished to pursue a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">At Lancaster House in June this year, after several months of tentative engagement, both Governments identified four critical issues that had to be resolved as part of any comprehensive agreement. They were a definitive and conclusive end to all paramilitary activity; the decommissioning through the IICD of all paramilitary weapons to an early timescale and on a convincing basis; a clear commitment on all sides to the stability of the political institutions and to any changes to their operation agreed within the review of the Good Friday Agreement; and support for policing from all sides of the community, and on an agreed framework for the devolution of policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Since then, we have spent an enormous amount of time and effort on these issues, the satisfactory resolution of which would open the way for the widest possible agreement. The package published by both Governments last week seeks to address and resolve the four core issues identified at Lancaster House. It does not in any way transcend the Good Friday Agreement, whose principles and values remain the template for both Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Sometimes it is a good idea for everyone to step back for a moment and pause. That is what we should do when considering what was published last Wednesday. We considered that the publication of these proposals was appropriate at this time. Both Governments made it clear in publishing their proposals that, while considerable progress had been made, not all elements were agreed. Nonetheless, we expressed the hope that the people of Northern Ireland would reflect on what was in prospect and the opportunity which the agreement, if accepted in its entirety, represented.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The proposals of the two Governments address, first, the ending of all paramilitary and other illegal activity. This is a prospect that everyone on this island will welcome. The ending of all paramilitary activity must also encompass all other illegal activity. The IRA statement on Thursday, while confirming its intentions regarding that organisation moving to a new mode, issuing instructions to volunteers and completing decommissioning to a rapid timescale, did not address this issue in the clear terms required by the Government. What we have been talking about was the completion of decommissioning by New Year's Eve.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Clarification is required that the IRA's commitment is, indeed, to a complete ending of paramilitarism and other illegal activity. The whole initiative is based on this vital premise. Any ending of paramilitary activity and other illegal activity would continue to be monitored by the Independent Monitoring Commission, which was set up jointly by both Governments last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The second issue with which we are dealing is completing the process of IRA arms decommissioning in a rapid time-scale. The proposals envisage two independent witnesses and the availability of photographs for inspection, as well as their later publication. The Governments' proposals in this respect continue to represent a fair and reasonable judgment and in the context of an overall comprehensive agreement, should have been sufficient to close the gap on this most sensitive issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I should make it clear that we always understood the photographs issue would be a difficult one for the IRA. However, in the context of an overall package, it was our understanding that this proposal would be considered by it. It has, of course, since said that they are unable to agree to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The third issue concerns the Governments' proposals seeking to secure a basis for the full operation of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, on an inclusive basis. The question of changes to the operation of the institutions of the Agreement has been exhaustively discussed and analysed since the review of the Agreement commenced in February of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">We were open to sensible changes which improved the working of the institutions or which addressed operational difficulties that had been experienced between 1999 and 2002. However, the fundamental architecture of the Agreement was not open to change, nor were its fundamental principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The Governments' proposals do envisage change in the operation of certain aspects of the operation of the Good Friday Agreement. Inevitably, every aspect of these institutional changes will not attract total agreement from all sides. However, the Government is fully satisfied that they respect and protect the fundamentals of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">In the context of an agreement, I welcome the prospect of the DUP operating and participating in all the new arrangements. I acknowledge, too, the support of Sinn Féin, which Gerry Adams has confirmed to me, for the political aspects of the Governments' proposals, which include those relating to the review of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Fourth, we have agreement on the basis on which the republican community would support the new policing arrangements. Agreement on the modalities of the devolution of justice and policing will be difficult but if enactment of the legislation can be secured as envisaged, it should allow Sinn Féin to take a positive decision on policing later next year. Such a decision by Sinn Féin on policing would be an enormous breakthrough and radically alter the climate of confidence and trust throughout Northern Ireland. I have always believed that the completion of the policing project would represent the consolidation of peace and political stability in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The Governments' Joint Declaration of May 2003 outlines in considerable detail the many other issues that will be addressed in the context of overall closure, including moving ahead rapidly with reducing the British military presence and addressing the matter of on-the-runs, or the OTRs as they are known. I have had further copies of the Governments' Joint Declaration placed in the Oireachtas Library as it is an important part of the architecture of the completion we are trying to secure.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The combined impact of our proposals would fully realise the vision of a new beginning promised by the Good Friday Agreement and the agreement of last week. Compared to where we were a year ago, the Governments' proposals represent a dramatic surge towards final closure. I have made it clear that the Government would play its part in addressing those areas, although few in number, that are relevant to us in this overall context.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Each of us — Governments and parties — must fulfil our obligations, some of which, taken in isolation, present the most profound difficulties. For our part, there are three such issues. First, there is the case of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and the wounding of Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan. I have previously addressed, in a comprehensive way, the circumstances in which their release would arise but let me repeat what those circumstances are. It will only arise in the context of a comprehensive agreement in which the International Monitoring Commission reported that all IRA paramilitary activity had ceased and the IICD reported that all IRA arms had been decommissioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">I said in Belfast that nothing can console those who were bereaved. The last thing we wish to do is to add further pain to the suffering these innocent families have already endured. My only hope is that the full knowledge of the comprehensive agreement that we have been seeking to secure will help clarify the environment in which we have been working. It was always the intention of the Government that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would meet with the McCabe and O'Sullivan families in advance of any decision on early release. Consultation with the GRA was also envisaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Second, there is the issue of the so-called "on-the-runs". These are individuals who have been on the run for crimes committed prior to the Good Friday Agreement. The two Governments agreed in Weston Park in July 2001 that these cases would have to be addressed. We went into some detail on this in the May 2003 Joint Declaration. Again, the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform addressed this issue in the House earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">Third, on the question of following-up, in an appropriate way on the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution (Seventh Report), this is an issue that has been discussed many times in the Dáil. I have frequently registered my support for the proposal to invite, on a periodic basis, Northern Ireland MPs to a committee of the Dáil regarding Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement, as I have for inviting MEPs from Northern Ireland to attend Seanad discussions on EU matters. Both such proposals are properly a matter for the Oireachtas itself and would have to be the subject of consultation and agreement with parties in this House and in the Dáil. There have been exaggerated reports about all of this. These proposals would not involve the granting of any rights or privileges. There would be no constitutional implications, nor would there be any question of cutting across the architecture and operation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">In the context of Seanad reform, and recognising the contributions made by Senators from Northern Ireland in the past to the work of this House, people such Seamus Mallon, Bríd Rodgers, John Robb, Gordon Wilson and, now, Senator Maurice Hayes, who have given insightful perspectives that have proven invaluable, I support increasing membership of the Seanad to provide cross-community representation from Northern Ireland. This could only be done by referendum. I imagine this is a matter on which all parties will have views. For my part, I would like to see such a referendum before the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The scope of what is in prospect is of real potential. The future lies in sorting out our differences through politics. Through politics, we have come a long way. The package that was unveiled last Wednesday is the signpost to a shared society. What is now required is a collective decision by all concerned to leave the past behind. I hope people will resist the temptation to score short-term political points against each other and see the opportunity that is staring us in the face for what it is. Another prolonged fallow period will only make the urgent task of building a new society more difficult. We need everyone's support to fully secure this comprehensive agreement. If we do not get agreement soon, we risk major delay in the restoration of the institutions. I therefore strongly urge all the parties not to delay unduly and to seize this moment of opportunity and real hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Let me add to what was said earlier today. It is clear to everybody now, a week on, that what was on offer was full decommissioning of the arms held by the IRA GHQ staff. The issue of the modalities of decommissioning, which had not been quite sorted out, was finalised at meetings between the IRA representative and General John de Chastelain which concluded in Friday night.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">There were questions regarding whether the issue of demilitarisation in Northern Ireland had been worked out between the parties, namely, Sinn Féin and the British Government. They are not issues that would be helpful, and that was accepted by everybody in the other House today. There was also the issue of making sure the agreement was fulfilled and ensuring stability of the institutions. There was also the very important issue of getting Sinn Féin and the IRA to sign up comprehensively on the issue of illegality. The Government statement right through this process included not only paramilitary activity but also illegality.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I want to make one further point which I made earlier today. In the context of the killers of Garda Jerry McCabe, some people referred to the fact that in 1988 the Government was very strong right through the discussions. Perhaps those of us who have been dealing with this matter over the past number of years understand it so well that we expect everybody else to understand it as well. When we moved in the past two years, and particularly in the past 20 months, to acts of completion, we did not set the agenda. The British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, made a speech in Belfast in October 2002. I made a similar speech shortly after that. We said that many issues in the Good Friday Agreement were not completed, but there were also issues that were not in the Good Friday Agreement with which we had to deal to get to a comprehensive statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Since that day in October 2002, two years and two months ago, we have been trying to get a comprehensive deal. The issue was moved along in March of last year and again in October of last year but was not finalised and moved to the final stage. We do not decide what are the acts of completion for the other side. I wish I could decide the acts of completion with the British Government, the DUP, the UUP, the PUP, Sinn Féin and everybody else. Everybody has issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">In the discussions to bring an end to the IRA, to move it to a new mode, to end the decommissioning issue once and for all, for the IRA to give in its guns to an international commission, to have the monitoring commission examine and monitor the new mode put on the table by the IRA, the release of the five remaining prisoners, we have left out the 57 others since 1988 to 1999. A number of those were in for capital murder and would not have been released until 2025. Those who killed Garda Hand and Garda Quaid, and many other prisoners, would not have been released until 2015-18. They have all been released.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">However, we did not allow the McCabe killers out. Six and a half years on this was an issue. It was not open to us in negotiations to end the IRA in the form in which we have all known for 30 years if not longer, to eliminate arms, obtain stability of the institutions, and to leave the prisoners in jail. It would have been great if it was. Arguments were made against releasing them. However, saying we were in favour of a comprehensive agreement and leaving out the bits we did not like was not a choice that was open to the Irish Government or to the British Government — I am here today in the Seanad to speak for the Irish Government. It was an impossibility to say that all the aspects were right, that we were right to try to end criminality and illegality, but that the issue regarding the killers of Garda McCabe should not have been conceded. Let us call a spade a spade. To say that we should not have conceded on a certain point would mean one is not in favour of a comprehensive agreement because that was part of it and we could not negotiate it. I want this to be very clear because there has already been mention of "no fudging". To say one is in favour of a comprehensive agreement implies that one must be in favour of all aspects of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">We did not decide this and would perhaps have liked it to be another way. Certainly, we would have liked a situation where the killers of Detective Garda McCabe would never be considered for early release. If one takes that view, however, then one must accept that decommissioning and other aspects of the settlement will not be achieved. I wish to be clear on this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">We will obviously continue our efforts and will carry on as far as we can in dealing with the fundamental issues that must be resolved around the question of illegality. We hope to make progress on this and on the issue of the transparency of the entire operation of decommissioning, including independent witnesses, photographs and other issues. Our position in this regard remains the same as that outlined last week. We will continue with our efforts. Some helpful suggestions were made in the Dáil today which we will consider seriously, as we will any suggestions made in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I thank the Leader for inviting me to the House and affording me the opportunity to speak on this issue. This is the last occasion on which I will be in the House before Christmas. I wish the Cathaoirleach, all Members and staff a happy Christmas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_543">On behalf of our group and all Members, I welcome the Taoiseach back to the House. He has been here on two occasions since the new Seanad was elected in 2002. Whatever our differences about some of the details of the matter, which the Taoiseach put on the record, everyone in this House recognises the major contribution and effort his Government and officials have made. It is painstaking work, requiring significant amounts of time and sincere efforts to try to resolve the remaining problems that lie in the way of the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. My party recognises that and I thank the Taoiseach for coming today.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I do not need to put on record the historic role played by my party in advancing the peace process, not just over the past ten years but over the past 30 years. This role has included involvement in the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, when there was, unfortunately, a breakdown in the bipartisan approach that had historically been taken on Northern Ireland, through to the party's short period in Government when the Framework Documents were published.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">There is no greater prize in this country than peace and a total end to the violence we have seen over the past 35 years. This is the greatest national objective we face. It is important to state that this is everybody's peace process. It does not belong only to the IRA and Sinn Féin whose members regularly tell us we would not have a peace process if not for them. We had a peace process years before the IRA decided to stop its murderous campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Those of us in constitutional politics have argued and conceded the principle of consent. Fine Gael did so through the document published in 1971 by former Taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald and former Deputy Paddy Harte, entitled Towards a New Ireland. Fianna Fáil conceded the principle some years later. Constitutional Nationalist politicians have always accepted the peace process. I get frustrated when I hear those most recent converts to the notion of peaceful politics lecturing the rest of us on this issue. The peace process belongs to everyone and we each have a responsibility to make it work.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I am somewhat alarmed by developments in recent years whereby those parties that have done so much to foster peace and reconciliation, particularly the SDLP and Mr. David Trimble's UUP in Northern Ireland, are now somewhat at the edges. Having failed to build a process on a multi-party basis, we now seem to work on the basis of the two extremes, the DUP on one side and Sinn Féin on the other. In a sense, those two parties have done everything in their power in recent years to make their own political ends from the Agreement. This is reprehensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">I wish to echo a comment made by former Senator Seamus Mallon over the weekend. He said, "We do not want to see the Balkanisation of Northern Ireland, where we have the leadership of Nationalist, Catholic, republican Ireland through the form of Mr. Adams, and the leadership of Unionist Ireland through the form of Dr. Paisley." There are many parties in Northern Ireland, all with something to contribute. I plead with the Taoiseach to take on board the sincere views offered by the SDLP, through its leader, Mr. Mark Durkan, over the past 48 hours. We must involve everyone. This type of zero sum game which excludes some opinion to the advantage of the larger parties is doomed to failure. The Taoiseach is sensitive to this and understands it, especially in regard to the SDLP.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">I wish to raise three issues, the first of which relates to Seanad reform. Over the years, we have had many fine contributions from colleagues from Northern Ireland. The current representative is Senator Maurice Hayes, who is a great tribute to this House and a great proponent of peace. His perceptions and views add significantly to debate in the House. Even at this early stage, however, and having listened to the Taoiseach's view, I contend that the process of Seanad reform should not be cherry-picked. If the Seanad is to be reformed, all relevant proposals should be on the table and we should see it through.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_242">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_551">I signed off on the document the Leader launched some two years ago, which outlined the views of the Sub-committee on Seanad Reform. The foreword to this document states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_552">We strongly believe that the recommendations should be implemented in their totality as a package. The sub-committee therefore recommends that the Taoiseach should nominate two Senators from Northern Ireland, one from the Unionist and one from the Nationalist traditions. The sub-committee recommends that these two nominations should be specifically designated, either by way of a constitutional amendment or legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">If the Taoiseach proposes to bring forward a referendum on this issue only, many of the graduates who voted 25 years ago to have the rights of the third level sector recognised may be in disagreement. I have nothing against the proposal the Taoiseach is bringing to the House. However, it must be couched in terms of general reform. Will the Taoiseach consider this?</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I disagree with the Taoiseach about the question of the release of the killers of Detective Garda McCabe. The Taoiseach is aware of the views of my party on this issue. In all of this, the Taoiseach has been sincere. I do not believe the suggestion made by Mr. Gerry Adams last weekend that the Taoiseach was not absolutely clear about this issue in 1998. As a Member of the other House in 1998, I recall a private discussion with the Taoiseach in which he said that he was clear in informing IRA representatives that the Agreement did not include the killers of Detective Garda McCabe.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I ask for some modicum of understanding regarding our position on this important issue, which goes to the heart of what we are as a country. We all made compromises in 1998, including the release of 54 killers in this jurisdiction and more than 400 in Northern Ireland. That was the deal that was done and we were clear about that commitment. However, some time between March 2003 and May 2004 the question of the release of the McCabe killers was conceded. My sincere view is that we should never have conceded on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">What would the IRA and Sinn Féin have done if this concession had not been given? Would they have said it was the end of the process and that they would wait until the killers were released? If we had stood firm, we would have overcome. Unfortunately, a gun was put to the Taoiseach's head when the IRA and Sinn Fein demanded this concession. Most decent Irish people abhor the notion that these people should be let out of prison before they have served their term. Doing so serves to legitimise in some way the appalling act they carried out. The Irish people are divided on that matter, which the Taoiseach knows as well as I do.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">I welcome the clarification on the issue of criminality by both Government parties last week. We must resolve this issue. In this State, Sinn Féin has been allowed to get away with murder, literally. In many constituencies it runs roughshod over disadvantaged communities. We must take a firm stance and make it clear that the end of criminality means once and for all an end to the kind of policing that organisation wants of some communities and an end to the torture and humiliation of people. We must fight for that and I wish the Taoiseach success in this matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_558">I welcome the Taoiseach to the House. I also welcome the rapidity with which he agreed to come. All parties in the House were firm in their resolve that he should come here to discuss Northern Ireland and bring us up to date. As Leader of the House I am pleased to contribute to this debate and to listen to the points of view of other Senators. Members of this House have always reflected a wide range of views and contributed enormously to our understanding of Northern Ireland issues, a point made very tellingly by Senator Ross last Friday, when he said that the contribution of Northern voices here helped to add to the texture of debate in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The Government's comprehensive proposals for agreement and blueprint for progress published last week represent a remarkable achievement. When the Taoiseach made his contribution, we could see the steps that have been taken in the past 12 months, their acceleration and where each step has led, to the point where the prize was in our grasp. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes in saying that the attainment and consolidation of peace is the biggest prize we as a Parliament could get.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I pay tribute to the work of the Taoiseach and Taoisigh down the years, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his predecessors, including the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in difficult and complex negotiations that culminated in the publication of the Government's proposals. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes's outline of the steps that led to this point. We did not reach this stage because somebody woke up one day and suggested having a review and an independent monitoring commission. All along the road flag-posts had to be passed, culminating in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The full acceptance and implementation of this landmark package would be a huge step forward towards putting the conflict of the past behind us and building a better future for everyone on the island. I urge all parties and all communities to persevere in fully securing the potential. The Government's comprehensive package has the capacity to resolve the key outstanding issues, which the two Governments identified at Lancaster House in June. The Taoiseach stated that some positive proposals had been made in the other House. While this may be a small one, I want to make this proposal regarding having a clergyman from each of the two denominations present with the military personnel to vouch for the decommissioning. Verification seems to lie at the heart of the present impasse. Placing greater emphasis on the presence of two clergymen and their capacity to contribute could be very fruitful. While they have been mentioned, this point has always been glossed over.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The completion of the process of arms decommissioning addresses the definitive ending of paramilitary activity. It ensures the stability of the institutions and of dealing with issues of policing and justice. While it has been a long and difficult road, it is clear that all sides have travelled a great distance towards achieving an agreement that addresses the key issues that have bedevilled the process since the Good Friday Agreement was signed. It will all lead to a better society for everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I agree with the Taoiseach that some people believe things are going fine in the North. There seems to be peace, business is good and people are going about their communities. As Senator Ó Murchú said here last week, a vacuum is dangerous and a vacuum in place of a democratic institution can be extremely dangerous. A democratic institution allows those of different persuasions to manage the affairs of their communities. Throughout our lives all of us in democratic politics have striven to allow people to govern themselves. When the Northern Ireland devolved institutions were operating there were several area, particularly agriculture, where a firm hand on the leadership tiller facilitated bringing a community along a very difficult road.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">We all seek the restoration of the institutions because a vacuum is very dangerous. We seek a society free from sectarian harassment, where the people can give their full allegiance to the police service, where normal security arrangements apply and where people no longer need fear the scourge of paramilitarism. Under these arrangements the IRA has made a commitment to achieve a totally peaceful society and has committed itself to putting all arms completely and verifiably beyond use.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The DUP has made a commitment to participate in all the arrangements provided for in the Agreement and to work in an inclusive way in constructive partnership with all the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the benefit of the whole community. The DUP also commits itself to meet its obligations in each of the strands of the Agreement, including the North-South bodies, which represents a massive step forward for that party. From the days of saying "No" to everything it is now committed to working the North-South bodies, which, when operational, worked very favourably for the whole island.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Like the Taoiseach in Belfast last Wednesday, I would like refer to something said by the then chairperson of the international body on decommissioning, Senator George Mitchell. When Fianna Fáil was in Opposition from 1994 to mid-1997, we met Senator Mitchell on many occasions. He said that decommissioning should not require that any party be seen to surrender, on which I believe agreement exists across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">As we are in this Chamber, which has been the subject of Seanad reform, I wish to stress that we did not present the report to the Taoiseach two years ago, but in April 2004, as the other parties involved in Seanad reform know. In the early 1980s I was a Member of this House for two short terms when Séamus Mallon and Bríd Rodgers were Senators. Now we enjoy the company and contributions of Senator Maurice Hayes, whom the Taoiseach appointed. They offer a different point of view, bringing us a sense of what it is like to live in another part of this island. They bring a civic contribution to the affairs of the nation. Formalising that would be an excellent step.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I attempt to soften my tone, as we should be prudent in our language. It is not a matter of cherry-picking. We are talking about the North, which is why I have highlighted that issue. If we were discussing university Senators I would mention the pending legislation to give all third-level institutions a voice. Most Senators who spoke had grievances about aspects of Seanad reform. However, on the matter of Northern representation all were <i>ad idem</i> and wished to see it happen. They were pleased by the Northern voices, not in any way in a sense of patronage but in a sense of appreciation that ultimately we are all from one island and their voices are valuable to us. I again thank the Taoiseach for coming to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_571">It is very rare that a Minister, let alone a Taoiseach, gets universal applause from the House. We might not all agree with everything he has been doing regarding the Northern Ireland peace process. However, we salute the energy and dedication he has shown and applaud him on the relentless way he has pursued peace in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Whatever our differences on other issues, it is remarkable that in recent times debates of this sort have revealed a unity which is to the tremendous credit of the Seanad and its Members. The Leader and the Taoiseach will recall that less than 15 years ago we could not debate Northern Ireland in this House without fire and brimstone descending and rash and foolish comments being made, which were somewhat primitive in their origins and were extremely unhelpful in bringing peace to this island. It is right that the Taoiseach and his predecessors, Albert Reynolds, Deputy John Bruton, Garrett FitzGerald and Charles Haughey should be saluted for the great work they have done in respect of the peace process. Some of them do not get the credit they deserve. It may be that the Taoiseach will be given final credit for bringing peace to this part of the island but there is a pantheon of heroes who have done a great deal in the pursuit of peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The latter should be recognised by me and others who come from what is undoubtedly a different outlook on this subject. I was not brought up in the same type of atmosphere, with the same basic beliefs or in the same tradition as some Members of the House. However, those of us who come from different traditions — by that I mean different religious denominations — must recognise that whereas we have come some way, others have had to make an even greater effort to meet our beliefs on this matter. We should salute them for that. Senator Mansergh, with whom I have had many spats on other minor issues, has played a tremendous part in the peace process and that should be recognised.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_575">I wish to address one or two of the issues that have been raised. As Senator O'Rourke correctly stated, the contribution of those Members from Northern Ireland who have served in the House has been tremendous in terms of helping us to accept what is the great challenge in Irish life and politics at present. I do not wish to name any of them in particular. It is perfectly acceptable and welcome that the Taoiseach should continue to nominate people from Northern Ireland to serve in this House. If necessary, he should appoint as many as four Members from that part of the island. There would be dangers in enshrining this in the Constitution and I fail to see the benefits of doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">As Senator O'Rourke stated, Senator Maurice Hayes plays a leading and authoritative role in bringing us some knowledge of Northern Ireland. Mr. Haughey started the very successful experiment of nominating people from Northern Ireland to this House and what he did has been continued by nearly all of his successors. I see no reason for changing the current method of nomination because it has worked extraordinarily well.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The Northern Ireland issue has tended to be above and different from the normal cut and thrust of politics in this country. Successive taoisigh have regarded and treated it as such. Their nominees to the Seanad have reflected that and I am happy with the current position.</p>

Like Senator Ross, I come from a different background to some Members of the House. I was formerly a southern Unionist, I am Church of Ireland, I am not republican and I am a Nationalist only in so far as I love this country.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_581">The Taoiseach showed great maturity and the vast majority of the decent, ordinary people of Ireland, among whose ranks I include myself, strongly supported and saluted the Taoiseach for what he did on that occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I also like the approach taken by the Taoiseach in his speech. If it is a question of the glass being half full or half empty, the Taoiseach unhesitatingly states that it is half full. He stated that certain matters were "not wholly successful" and indicated that he is "not unduly pessimistic". That, in my opinion, is the way to approach this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">As Senator Ross stated, we have tried to have debates on this matter on several occasions in the Seanad but we were informed at times that the issues involved were too sensitive. Does the Taoiseach really believe that Mr. Adams and the Dr. Paisley are sensitive little animals? I do not believe so. I also do not believe the negotiations would be blown off track by something said in this House. I doubt that anyone pays a great deal of attention to what we might say.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">In my view, photographs are largely an irrelevance. We should put it right up to Dr. Paisley and inform him that he is welcome to observe historic acts of decommissioning in person and report back to his people on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I am amazed at the sensitivity of Sinn Féin and the IRA. I recall a time when they used to use a visual image accompanied by the legend "sniper at work". That was a particularly nasty, vindictive and humiliating image. I wonder how it ran with the families of people such as Stephen Restorick, a decent young man who was gunned down.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I share the sympathy all people, including the Taoiseach, have for the widow of the late Detective Garda McCabe. Everybody must feel that sympathy at this time of year. It is important that contact be maintained on a continual basis with Mrs. McCabe. The Taoiseach is usually very good at dealing with human issues of this nature. However, it must be stated that those involved were engaged in a bank heist. They carried out the cold blooded murder of a defenceless man who was strapped into a car. By first denying and subsequently claiming these individuals, the IRA has defined itself into an area of criminality. There must be an end to this. The Taoiseach massaged the language when referring to this matter by stating that it was "illegal activity". It is illegal to have a dog without a licence but nobody would place that in the same category as approaching a defenceless man in a car, pulling the trigger and killing him. We must state that there can be no criminal activity. The IRA is not in charge of language. It cannot state that certain things are criminal for everybody else but not for members of its organisation. I do not believe the people of Ireland would accept that.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">It is important that the Taoiseach has come before the House this evening because the Seanad has become involved in these issues. While the House has been enriched by the contributions of Members from Northern Ireland, such as former Senator John Robb and Senator Maurice Hayes, their presence here came about as a result of nomination by the Taoiseach. I am not sure it is wise to make constitutional provision for representation from the North of Ireland. There was an interesting letter on this matter in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning which I am sure the Taoiseach has read. The points therein are well made and should be borne in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I wish the Taoiseach well. I hope the IRA goes out of business. It is about time this happened. There is something sadly anachronistic about the name of Sinn Féin which translates as "ourselves alone". In this complex world of globalisation and interrelatedness, nobody is on their own. Sinn Féin must learn that it cannot be on its own.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">I commend the Taoiseach on his valiant efforts in respect of this matter and I wish him success.</p>

          <p eId="para_591">All Members bring with them life experiences, on which they are expected to draw when they contribute to debate in this House. In keeping with that tradition, I speak in this most important debate as a proud Member of Seanad Éireann upholding those principles. Diversity of views shared in a House of this sort is the essence of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Like previous speakers, I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government on their handling of the negotiations on the peace process to date. Many Irish citizens have short memories. They would prefer to forget our troubled history and the fact that, in the aftermath of 1969, the country teetered on the edge of anarchy. The strong Government, together with the loyalty of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána, ensured the country was not propelled into the abyss.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">I spent 21 years of my life serving this country as a member of the Defence Forces, working side by side with my colleagues in the Garda Síochána. We were loyal to the State, loyal to the Government of the day and carried out our duties without fear or favour in the interests of the democratic society in which we now live. I, like my colleagues on the day we were commissioned, swore an oath that I would be loyal to the Constitution and the State. In carrying out those duties, we did so in the clear knowledge that the same State and Government we served would reciprocate loyalty. Some paid the ultimate price for that service and those of us who wore the uniform of the State are more conscious of that than most.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I now find myself on the other side of the fence as a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Peace on this island is worth fighting for and no true democrat should stand in the way of that prize. The views I express this evening are my own personal views. Since I entered politics I have consistently stated that I am opposed to the early release of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. In doing so, I put tremendous pressure on other members of my party and the Oireachtas who are similarly disdainful at the prospect of this happening. This is not my intention. I have searched long and hard to find it in my heart to move on in the interests of the greater good, to seize the opportunity offered at this time for a complete and final settlement of the problems that have bedevilled this island for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The Government of this country, which is elected by the people to serve the people, is being asked to do the unthinkable, to free the unrepentant killers of a member of the Garda Síochána who died protecting the very people the Government is elected to serve. Sinn Féin has forced the Government into this position. Sinn Féin is a party that is part of our democratic process yet it is making a demand which flies in the face of democracy. No party, bar one, wants these men released.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">I voted for the Good Friday Agreement and, in doing so, I accepted the early release of garda murderers. When doing so I believed that the killers of Detective Garda McCabe would not be released because I clearly and unequivocally considered the killing to be an act of murder carried out by criminals, criminals who were disowned by Sinn Féin and then, when caught, were given comfort, succour and support by Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">In recent days there has been much talk about a full and comprehensive end to criminality. I, together with the vast majority of Irish people, felt that such an end was inherent in voting for the Good Friday Agreement. I drew the line in the sand that day and since then what did I get but a Sinn Féin interpretation of peace and democracy, a continuation of kneecappings, punishment beatings, exiling, extortion and racketeering. The witnesses in the trial of Detective Garda McCabe were intimidated, resulting in a charge of murder being reduced to one of manslaughter. Is that the democracy we want?</p>

          <p eId="para_599">Now, to end that version of democracy, Sinn Féin demands the release of the criminals who killed Detective Garda McCabe. How can Sinn Féin convince me and others like me that in crossing this new line, it is sincere about ending all association with criminality? How can it condition my mind to allow me even to contemplate such a move? How can it tell me that I should once again betray the memory of an innocent servant of the State? Sinn Féin's current inflexibility hardly engenders trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Sinn Féin has led us a merry dance. First it walks away then it offers to return provided we grant just one more concession. On each occasion, it ratchets up its bottom line. The Irish people also have a bottom line. They are saying loud and clear, "Thus far shalt thou go and no further."</p>
          <p eId="para_601">In recent days, Sinn Féin has said it will not be humiliated by photographs of decommissioning. As a Member of the Oireachtas, I respond by saying that I can see no greater humiliation than Members of the Oireachtas posing for a photograph in prison with the killers of a member of the Garda Síochána.</p>

I know they have reluctantly accepted the dishonest demands of Sinn Féin in the name of securing peace. I am not here to criticise or condemn. The Taoiseach carries a huge responsibility, as does his Government, on behalf of the Irish people. As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said in the Dáil today, the Government is as one. My views are my personal views. My contribution may not be the support the Taoiseach needs at this time but I also know that the concerns of the people who share my views are entitled to be aired in this debate. I am sure the Government accepts that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I ask the Government to make it clear to Sinn Féin that it must start to deliver. It cannot continue to make more demands as the peace process evolves. Full and total decommissioning must take place within an aggressive time frame. There must be a signed commitment to end criminal activity and paramilitarism in all its forms for once and for all. We, as a democratic State, cannot be constantly bullied into conceding what we should not.</p>

          <p eId="para_614">I have always been in a peculiar position about the North in that I spoke sympathetically about Sinn Féin and its supporters when no one else did, at least publicly; I know of the private work done by many in this House, including Senator Mansergh. I talked about the need to draw people in, to get people out of a cul-de-sac, which I concede was of their own making, and now find myself quoting Dr. Ian Paisley about the need "to bite our lips" on some issues. Some of us who put our necks on the line politically to achieve that 15 or 20 years ago are entitled to say now that enough is enough. It is time to end the political dance into which we all have been hauled in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Many Senators find it extremely difficult to stomach the political opinions, leadership and role of the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party. Some people feel, however, that it is somehow less insensitive and less threatening to the peace process and everything we want to achieve to say something negative about him, than it is to say something about the leaders of a political and paramilitary movement that has deliberately killed hundreds of our fellow Irish people. How have we lost a sense of the difference between political disagreement and the fundamental moral gulf that separates us from a political organisation that engaged in a campaign of violence that did not have any moral or political basis?</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The IRA is not the ANC or any of the liberation movements which I have supported throughout my political career. Its members were never in the situation in which Nelson Mandela found himself in South Africa and I am tired of the posturing of those who claim that they were. That type of nonsense was encountered again last week when the IRA said it will not do anything that would undermine the Agreement. Its representatives have said for the past two years that the IRA has done nothing to undermine the Agreement. They have pointed the finger at others over and over again.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">I do not want to be unhelpful in this regard. People like me were willing to work, as a necessary part of being helpful, with people from Northern Ireland who had Sinn Féin and republican — with a small "r"— sympathies as part of an attempt to open doors. We should make clear to such people that they have alienated further many of those with whom they never had much sympathy. I refer to their scandalous political attacks on the Progressive Democrats, for example. I do not agree with the Progressive Democrats about much, or even anything.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_620">I have a good story about that, which I will share with the Senator privately.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Senior Sinn Féin figures use a certain type of language when speaking about the minority Government party. If any of the rest of us used such language when talking about Sinn Féin, its members would be in front of the television cameras using the classic old phrase "hit me now, with the peace process in my arms", which they are inclined to use over and over again. It is time they became fully involved in the norms of political debate. Others are entitled to hand out to Sinn Féin members what they hand out to others. I am not trying to be destructive when I argue that they should engage in the normal routine of political debate, as we do in this House on a daily and hourly basis. I hope those of us to whom they looked for some sympathy when nobody would talk to them can have some modicum of influence over them. We can help them to realise that they are rapidly backing themselves into the cul-de-sac from which they escaped.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Society does not have room for the shadowy enforcers of law and order, many of whom are involved in anti-drugs campaigns, who are found in many working class communities. I refer to those who knocked on a door in Tralee and, allegedly, used their eloquence to persuade somebody to gently hand back a stolen television. We are expected to believe that hardened criminals changed their minds and handed back stolen goods, simply because of the eloquence of senior members of Sinn Féin, but we know what was behind that. It was criminal activity, which should be clearly understood as any activity that is in breach of the law of the state in which one lives. Criminal activity is not what one chooses to call it. If we are to make progress, we should dismiss any suggestion of moral equivalence. There is, and never has been, any room in Irish society for the killing, murdering and maiming of other people in the name of any political objective. It needs to be stated bluntly and clearly that we have waited long enough. We have held our peace, kept our silence and restrained ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I do not agree with many Senators on the issues arising from the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. If the release of his killers was the only thing preventing the achievement of an otherwise comprehensive, enforceable and permanent agreement and a political party in this State was willing to be involved in such an agreement, we would have to bite our lips again. Irish people are entitled to ask the party that is calling for their release how we can trust it inside or outside Government, given that it has changed its mind. How can we trust Sinn Féin, given that it told lies about the matter at the time, for example by pretending that it had nothing to do with the killing? That, and not whether certain people will be released from prison under certain as yet unrealised circumstances, is the fundamental political question. How can a political party expect decent law-abiding people in this State to trust it when it denied that the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe were aligned to it until the dust had settled on peace? That, and not the potential release of the people in question, is the fundamental issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">As Senator Maurice Hayes said eloquently in the House some weeks ago, we have to understand the position of those who have endured the agonising process of watching killers being released. I understand their position, but I am entitled to ask the political party that sees the issue as being part of a comprehensive agreement what it really stands for.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMauriceHayes" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_625">It is quite moving to follow the last two speeches, which were very strong. I commend Senators Minihan and Ryan on their contributions. I join other Senators in thanking the Taoiseach and paying tribute to him for the work he has done. It has been pointed out that he is one of a long line of taoisigh, Ministers for Foreign Affairs and others who have kept this process going for so long. As someone who lives in the North, I may have a more vested interest than most in this matter. Many of us think that the bipartisan policy in this jurisdiction has been one of the great stabilising factors during the process. People in this State have not made the North a political football. That tradition has been continued in the tone of the debate in this House and elsewhere. It has been a hugely important contribution to stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">In examining the current difficulties in the North, it is easy to forget from where we have come. Ten years ago, Christmas in the North was marked by the sound of shattering glass, as towns and cities were blown apart. It is now marked by the rattling of tills, particularly in places like Newry and Belfast, as people travel across the Border for cheap booze. Progress has been made, the parties have moved an enormous distance and guns have remained silent. We are moving towards an endgame. I am encouraged by the approach and remarks of the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">Two or three aspects of the process need to be addressed. I refer to the question of trust, for example. We need to find a means of validating decommissioning that enables the DUP to satisfy their sceptical followers and others without causing republicans to feel they have to jump through the hoops of public humiliation. The issue of guns is becoming less and less important as time goes by. The need for decommissioning exists in the areas mentioned by Senators — criminal behaviour, intimidation, oppression and domination of communities, rough justice, extortion and involvement in various forms of criminality. I am not saying all republicans are criminals. I was interested in a definition I read the other day to the effect that no republican could be a criminal. This is very pleasant news.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The paramilitary organisations on both sides of the divide have used criminal methods and others both to impose themselves on communities and to raise funds. Some have not grown out of it and cannot desist from it. We will not see an end to criminality. A problem in much of Northern Ireland is that one is not sure whether the criminal organisations are smugglers moonlighting as paramilitaries or paramilitaries moonlighting as smugglers. This view will continue to be held. However, it is important that there be no organic connection between any political party and any organisation tainted by criminality.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">How can an organisation demonstrate this? Sinn Féin could do so in a very marked way by getting involved in the policing arrangements and not waiting for some possible date, perhaps two years down the line, when everything else has been put into place. If it did so, it would be much easier for it to convince the sceptical public of its bona fides on decommissioning. There can be no higher proof of one's commitment to the values of a state than one's willingness to enforce the laws of that state. Sinn Féin could adopt this principle now.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Enormous changes have been made in policing in recent years. The report of the Oversight Commissioner, whose function is to implement the recommendations of the Patten report, states that it is now critical to have the involvement of all parties, by which the commissioner means Sinn Féin. One may say one has abjured criminality, knee-capping and vigilantism, but one must ask who will engage in policing. Who will protect old ladies and children if the policing arrangements have not been signed up to? My main appeal to Sinn Féin is that it get involved in policing. This would carry the party a long way.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I was pleased to note the Taoiseach's refusal to do nothing. There is a very dangerous canard circulating in respect of devolution. I do not blame people in the South for losing patience with the peace process because it is generally the case that the process of clearing up after a war takes much longer than the hostilities themselves. This is particularly true of civil war, as we know only too well in this country. We must not expect miracle cures but, at the same time, the worst thing we could do is say the various parties involved should be left to their own devices and that they are happy enough with devolution. This actually discredits very rapidly those people who have, through great effort, convinced an organisation that saw no other approach but the gun to begin to espouse the way of democratic politics, even if it has not done so as quickly or as fully as some of us would like.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Conflicts such as that in Northern Ireland seem to operate on a cyclical and generational basis. If the people who convinced the paramilitaries to espouse the way of democratic politics are discredited, another group of younger, more radical and disaffected people will say they have had their go at politics and failed and they will turn to violence. It is vital, therefore, that we make politics work. I commend the Taoiseach in this regard. It is a great pleasure and honour for me to congratulate him on his work, support him and encourage him and the other parties to keep at it.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_633">I apologise for not being present for the Taoiseach's contribution. I would have liked to have heard him but I was delayed at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">I rarely speak on Northern Ireland issues in the House but I have recently felt rather emotional about them. What has probably energised me is the unfair criticism on the part of Fianna Fáil to the effect that Fine Gael has deviated from what has always been classified as bipartisanship on Northern Ireland issues. Senator Mansergh did so in last Saturday's <i>The Irish Times</i> and Deputy Noel Dempsey did so today, as did the Taoiseach. I have mentioned the Jerry McCabe issue previously and it has been mentioned many times in this House. Senator Mansergh referred to it in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday. I make no apologies for making a stand on it because I feel very strongly about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">One may ask why I make no apologies. I have never spoken in this or the other House about an experience I had in west Limerick on 31 March 1990, 14 years ago, when I was a newly elected Deputy. In that year, the IRA ran a lawless campaign in which it robbed post offices and set fire to cars. I ask Members to visualise themselves in the circumstances in which I found myself. I was getting out of my car to go to a political function when a guy wearing a balaclava came alongside me and pointed his pistol or gun at me. I believed at first that it was an April fool's joke on the basis that 1 April was the next day, but I realised how serious the matter was when two other guys came out of the shadows, one of whom had a petrol container. I visualised straight away that my car would get torched like other cars had been torched, not realising what the three men would use the car for. I was told to open the boot and wondered if I would be put into it. I recall getting into the back of a car and the guy at the back pushing me down on the floor, taking off my glasses and putting a balaclava on me back to front so I could see nothing. They were talking on the basis of "No. 1", "No. 2" and "No. 3" and one recognised me as a local Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I was thinking of Bill Fox who had been murdered near the North of Ireland and did not know what would happen to me. I recall saying an act of contrition in the car because I was absolutely petrified and the men were accusing me and all politicians of being collaborators. I was then dropped off at the side of the road and they took off and warned me not to move. I was petrified over what would happen if I did move.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Eventually, I walked to Rathkeale, which was a mile away and where I saw the fire station lit up and wondered what was happening. What had happened was that my abductors had set fire to the shop of a person who had a late-night business in the town. They set fire to it for their own ulterior motives. I will not expand on that because the shop-owner has gone out of business since the event. He was entirely traumatised afterwards because the men were never tracked down. On the Sunday evening after my abduction, I saw my car on a transporter being brought to Dublin for forensic analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I have a clipping from the <i>Limerick Leader</i> issued at the time of the incident. It claims that on the day following the event, one of those responsible phoned and said that Deputy Finucane would confirm he had not been harmed. This was true but the men frightened the life out of me and my family.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Events such as that described are bound to influence one's thinking. I am thankful that I was spared. I have put the event to the back of my mind and have not referred to it in either House in 14 years. However, I refer to it now in the context of what happened to Jerry McCabe — God be good to him — and to Ben O'Sullivan in Adare in 1996. I am thankful that Ben O'Sullivan recovered. Such events are bound to colour one's assessment and that is why I resent Fine Gael being criticised for expressing its view. I feel perfectly entitled to express my view because I feel very strongly about the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">It is correct for Mrs. McCabe to feel very upset on the basis that she was promised that the killers of her husband would not be released. One may argue that they can be exonerated and that their release is justifiable and sustainable as part of the peace process. Is this argument valid?</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The SDLP has recently criticised the Good Friday Agreement because the impact of the text on it and the Unionists has been changed. The people who held faith with the peace process through difficult phases have been sidelined. Gerry Adams was on "The Late Late Show" last Friday spinning and criticising Fine Gael because its members dared to express their views on the release of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, which reflected the thinking of approximately 80% of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The leader of our party expressed himself extremely well in the debate in the other House today when he outlined Fine Gael's role in the peace process over the years. We will not accept lecturing on this issue. We have always been fair-minded on this and supported the Taoiseach in his intense efforts to resolve this problem. We did not play the blame game although we could if we so wish wonder about some of the changes and utterances in the past week and if there is confusion about the Good Friday Agreement. We will not do that because it is not constructive. Let us point a way forward for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Sinn Féin members on television and radio are masterful at spin but I criticise television and radio journalists for at times failing to ask hard questions. Gerry Adams got a deafening round of applause last Friday night on "The Late Late Show". Pat Kenny did not ask him any difficult questions during that debate and those questions should be asked.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Sinn Féin appeals to a young electorate. We grew up at a time when Che Guevara was regarded as a hero in South America and was probably respected in this country because he was then a revolutionary. Our educated young people are giving the same respect to this party because they do not remember past incidents or what happened during the Troubles. They are influenced by the media and the spinning. Gerry Adams has no right to lecture Enda Kenny.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">When Sinn Féin decides to come in from the cold and get respectability within the body politic, it must stop masquerading. When Gerry Adams says he must find out what the IRA thinks it is as if the mirror is fogged and he asks the reflection what it thinks. People's minds are divided when Sinn Féin members and the people in charge speak, wondering whether they are expressing their own views or speaking on behalf of the IRA. Many people seem to know what the IRA wants to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I have often criticised the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this House but I respect his intolerance for an agreement to which Sinn Féin or the IRA would sign up that did not define the criminality factor.

That would be disadvantageous for the Northern Irish economy, from the point of view of moving on from the current lawlessness and level of crime. We have the opportunity to make a clean break with the past in terms of paramilitarism and of a consensus on policing and people joining up and participating in policing. None of those developments should be put off. There is a great onus on the parties in Northern Ireland and on the Governments to work hard before Christmas to try to crunch these issues and not to talk in terms of waiting until after the next elections and so on. We do not know what may happen, what accidents may occur to upset calculations. Let us strike while the iron is hot.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Reference has been made to four or five problems. The first is the language left out of the IRA statement. I will read it — incidentally it does not mention the word criminality — it states "...consistent with this and recognising the need to uphold and not to endanger anyone's personal rights and safety". How could anyone object to that? It was put to me on radio yesterday that this somehow involved the IRA admitting its campaign had been criminal. That is nonsense. Those words do not justify that interpretation. The Easter Proclamation contained the language "we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice, inhumanity or rapine". Was that an insult to, or slur on, the volunteers who took part in the Easter Rising? Of course not.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The notion that by definition the IRA does not commit crimes is preposterous. Even if it does compare itself to the ANC, that group, to its credit, admitted, before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, that it had committed many crimes which were not justified. It is fine for somebody from the DUP to say that he or she is not overly concerned about the issue but criminal, illegal activities are more likely to happen within the Nationalist community or the jurisdiction of the South. They are not likely to happen in loyalist east Belfast so that is not an adequate argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Transparency is the issue underlying photographs. There was insufficient transparency and that led to the problem. Part of the solution is that General de Chastelain should be allowed to say much more than he has been able to say in the past. The two clergymen should be allowed without restriction to say what they have witnessed. In a religious context I have difficulty with the maxim, "seeing is believing" because in many ways in the Christian religion believing is about not seeing.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">We were all moved by Senator Finucane's comments about the indefensible attack on the integrity of a citizen of this State, let alone a legislator. If the killers of Garda McCabe are to be released in the context that I need not repeat, that does not in any way legitimise an absolutely appalling act. The Government's line in the Good Friday Agreement, and in most other statements, was rightly that these prisoners would not under any circumstances benefit from the early release terms of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">They have not done so, and they will not be specified as prisoners. If there is ultimately any release, it will be carried out under other legislation and will not fall into that context. Regarding the SDLP, whose representatives members of many parties may have met yesterday, the case has been outlined here. The point must be made that the vast majority of its problems relate to strand one, the internal organisation of Northern Ireland, including such matters as the election of a First Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The Irish Government has no role regarding strand one, the internal operation of the Agreement. It cannot fairly be criticised for what has been negotiated. In the statements last week, for example, there were proposals from the British Government for changes to strand one institutions. Technically speaking, when we voted, we did so on the British-Irish Agreement, which did not contain material relating to the internal workings of the institutions. We also voted on changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. I am not convinced that the criticisms of the changes to strand one have the force the SDLP maintains, but it is fighting a political battle with Sinn Féin, something that we must understand. Of course, it was most unfairly criticised by Sinn Féin on policing, to which it signed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I will briefly address Seanad reform. There should be a constitutional provision, and it should be entrenched, since taoisigh are under a great many political pressures after an election. If it is not entrenched, one cannot guarantee it will always happen. There is practically universal agreement that Northern Senators have contributed very substantially. For example, Senator Maurice Hayes does not contribute solely on Northern Ireland or Europe; he brings a Northern perspective to a great deal of legislation we discuss in this House. That comparative perspective, whether on health or justice, contributes a great deal. If I have a criticism of the Seanad report — I have made it before — it is that two seats are not enough. If there are only to be two seats, they will inevitably go to someone associated with the two majority parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">My final point is very important. The peace process has not been, as is sometimes implied, one of appeasement, whereby Sinn Féin has been getting more and more. We must remember that we have been making many more demands on Sinn Féin. We have gone far beyond the text of the Good Friday Agreement. We are involved in a very important process of establishing full democracy on this island, something that has not fully existed in our lifetimes. Even in the 1950s and 1960s, the IRA was there in the background. We look forward to a situation of complete democracy, and we should not represent the peace process as a one-way street in which we have been giving ever more to Sinn Féin. The republican movement is giving more and more to us and to the democracy of this country.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_659">I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this important motion. I thank all the speakers I have heard so far and pay particular tribute to my colleague, Senator Finucane, for his account of what he went through personally. As I heard him say, he had never before spoken on the issue in either House. We have heard the sort of story which touches the soul and helps one understand how people can feel such hurt and pain regarding Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">In the summer of 1996, I attended the funeral of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. I did so because, some weeks previously, he had been with us when we had a meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Limerick, and because I felt such sympathy for the family and empathy with the gardaí. As one would appreciate, that Monday morning in Limerick was one of profound emotion, sorrow and anger. However, it was an ironic coincidence that, on that very day, talks were due to resume in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">During the mass, after communion but before final prayers, the priest asked the congregation if it would excuse the Taoiseach, former Deputy John Bruton, the Tánaiste, former Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Social Welfare, former Deputy De Rossa, who had to leave the church to catch a helicopter to Belfast to continue the Northern talks. He expressed the wish, as the three were leaving, that their talks might be successful and that, through that political process, they might help ensure that no family would have to undergo what the McCabes were going through that day. In a sense, that must be our starting and finishing point. The brutal reality of terrorism that came home to the McCabe family in the summer of 1996 should not be visited on any more families, North or South.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">My colleagues have very clearly expressed the position of the Fine Gael Party on the McCabe killing and killers. Our party leader, Deputy Kenny, gave a fine contribution on that issue today. Something that has always amazed, surprised and upset me regarding the McCabe killing — I should say "murder", for that is what it was — was the fact that the Sinn Féin Party and the IRA never said sorry. As we know so well, language is very important in the politics of Northern Ireland, and we sometimes hear half-sincere regrets and mealy-mouthed sympathies being extended. However, in this instance, where a person who was upholding the law and the integrity of this State was brutally killed by a criminal gang, we should have heard the word "sorry". To Gerry Adams and his colleagues in Sinn Féin, with whom we must all deal in our own way from time to time, I say this. If they are asking us to contemplate seeing the McCabe killers released at the behest of the Government as part of an overall completion package, as the Taoiseach called it, they should at least have the decency to express profound sympathy and a genuine apology for the killing.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Regarding the present talks, the point on which Senator Mansergh concluded is worth reflecting on, namely, what has been given by Sinn Féin. Senator Finucane rightly pointed out that they are masters of spin. Through that, they have hidden the fact that the political landscape of this island has truly changed. We all know what Sinn Féin were demanding ten, 15, 20 or 30 years ago; that is no longer the case. On this island, every political party is now in agreement with the right of the Unionist people to remain such for as long as the institutions of Northern Ireland provide for it. We have changed our Constitution to reflect that amazing transformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">If one were to make any criticism of Unionist politicians or their negotiators, it is that they have not clearly outlined in the requisite detail to their own voters and supporters what they have achieved. In the course of the past ten years since the 1994 ceasefire, we have given an absolute guarantee — not merely in writing but through a vote of the Irish people — to the Unionist family that, as long as they wish to remain part of the United Kingdom, they will do so. That was something we could not have envisaged 25, 30 or 40 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">When we talk about the ongoing conflict in Northern Ireland and the need to find a comprehensive solution to it, we must be careful about using the concepts of winners and losers. We cannot have winners or losers in this conflict. If one side is seen as having clearly won, unfortunately, that means that the other side has clearly lost. A settlement of that type will not last.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Those on the two sides of the equation should take much more note of what they have achieved. The Unionist people of Northern Ireland can take profound and quiet satisfaction from the fact that they are no longer under the military and political threat they were under in the 1970s and the 1980s. Nationalist families and communities in Northern Ireland tend to take great satisfaction from the fact that, having been in a sectarian state, they now have the full protection of both Governments, their integrity is guaranteed and they have full rights of government. That is the transformed Northern Ireland of today.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">We have not reached the final solution to putting in place the political structures to underpin what we all hope will happen. However, I listened to what the Taoiseach said today and, as Senator Norris said, he tried to show the glass being half full rather than half empty. Major progress has been made and let us not lose that now. To ensure we do not do so requires more quiet diplomacy, understanding and direct dialogue, but both sides in Northern Ireland have achieved a tremendous amount over the past ten years. They have achieved progress which was unimaginable 30 years ago. Let us not go back to the situation in the past. During the first term I spent in this House in 1987 to 1989 we discussed on almost a weekly basis the most recent outrage in Northern Ireland. Thankfully, we do not have those sort of debates any longer. We should not go back to that situation but should go forward and let everybody work together to achieve peace on this island which everybody deserves.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">I regard Senator Finucane as an honourable and decent gentleman and I have always found him to be so. The graphic description of his personal ideal would touch any heart. In a way it is indicative that at the root of seeking solutions there is the human element as well in the suffering people have gone through.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Last year I was invited to give an oration at two commemorations in Ireland of two Irish leaders who took opposing sides in the Civil War, one was General Liam Lynch and the other was Major General Donnacha O'Hannigan. My background would be republican and that would be my outlook. When I was unveiling the plaque to Major General O'Hannigan, I made the point that I felt at present we were experiencing a confluence of eras and aspirations.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The Civil War was a terrible time in Ireland where brother fought brother, family fought family and some terrible things were done in the name of Ireland. If one reads the debates of that time, it is easy to be circumspect and say that people made very wise comments and were very forgiving and accommodating against that tragic background, and that is true. There is an echo of that today in trying to find a solution to the long-standing Northern Ireland problem. I genuinely believe that and have said so on several occasions here, including on the Order of Business in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I salute all men and women of all shades of political opinion and those of no political opinion who have made a contribution to bringing us to where we are today. We have come a long way from that infamous dictum of a former British Prime Minister when she told us "out, out, out" in respect of every effort that was being made to try to stop what was happening here, to try to bring about a just society and above all else to establish a permanent peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">We are down to the specifics in our discussions and because of that to some extent it gets more difficult. When one talks in general terms or to some extent embraces rhetoric, it is much easier. However, when one comes down to decisions and the things one has to do, which go against the grain of what one believes in and stands for, that is when it gets particularly difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">At the beginning of the peace process I invited David Irvine to Dublin. One would have associated him with the loyalist side of the dispute in Northern Ireland. On that occasion Senator Mansergh chaired a debate. About 200 people turned up for it and they were not the type of people who usually attended such a debate. I was surprised at the type of people who came along from industry, the arts and other walks of life. They were not prompted to come, they had only become aware of the debate. This group was a microcosm of Ireland. It was not a focused audience from one particular aspect or one political group.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I particularly praise the Taoiseach and all those who have been involved in the process. It is my firm hope that we do not lose the opportunity to grasp the prize. I met a group of community activists form Belfast today. They made the same point that Senator Mansergh made. They said that so much has been given by the Nationalist community that at times they do not feel that has been reciprocated. They said in particular they are subject still to brutality at the hands of loyalist mobs. I am only making this point to illustrate that when we are trying to come to a conclusion, every aspect of the picture must be taken on board. That will be the sacrifice and the difficulty. The tone of this debate indicated quite clearly that we will stay together in that effort.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelBrennan" eId="spk_276">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_677">The poet, Gerald Griffin, best describes my home village of Adare in the following lines:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_678">Oh Sweet Adare! Oh lovely vale!</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_679">Oh, soft retreat of sylvan splendour,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_680">Nor summer sun, nor morning gale</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_681">E'er hailed a scene more softly tender.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">This was also the scene of an act which shocked the nation where Detective Jerry McCabe was shot to death and Detective Ben O'Sullivan was wounded on Friday, 7 June 1996. These two detectives were on duty escorting a post office delivery of money to pay old age pensions and social welfare benefits. This act was carried out by an armed gang in battle dress.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Many views and opinions on this act have been expressed by the public and questions asked. Can it be lawful for the Government to release those who killed Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and wounded Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan in Adare? In the minds of the public his killers were never to benefit from the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. The members of this gang were convicted of manslaughter, the lesser charge, as a result of intimidation of witnesses. Any reduction in sentences being served would not serve the greater good and would erode the confidence of the Irish people in our justice system. The ability of the Irish people to live and work together does not and should never depend on the early release of the killers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">I refute the claim by Gerry Adams that no republican activist can be a criminal. Criminality, including punishment beatings, knee-cappings, bank and post office robberies, including other acts, must end once and for all and must be included in any agreement reached. In a matter of weeks and months decisions will be made by leaders of Governments which will affect all our lives. There is a golden opportunity to take that final step towards peace and reconciliation on this island. Something of which all generations have dreamed is now within our grasp.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I have every confidence that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the members of the Government, together with the leaders involved on all sides, will have the courage to bring about a comprehensive and just settlement, and that the communities, North and South, will have the will to accept its implementation to a final conclusion. I have seen in my home village Catholics, Protestants and Methodists — people of all religious persuasions and none — work together and for one another within our community. Should it not be our dream to see that peace and tranquillity extended North and South within the island of Ireland in our lifetime?</p>
          <p eId="para_686">In conclusion, there is a small marble plaque on the wall of Adare Garda station. It reads: "In memory of Detective Jerry McCabe who gave his life in the service of his country at Adare on 7 June 1996." There is an image of a dove on that plaque showing the outline of the face of Detective Garda McCabe on its wings. However, equally important, a message is written in stone around the verge of that plaque which reads: "For the Peace and Love of my fellow man. For the Justice of my Fellow Man. Peace and Understanding of my Fellow Man." I wish the Taoiseach well in his work for a lasting peace in our land.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">This is an important and relevant debate and I thank all responsible for providing the opportunity to hold it before the recess. In acknowledging the work of all in this process, we must consider the wider context of how far we have all come. In this regard, I single out the work of the Taoiseach and do not think anyone would want to take from his stand in regard to moving the peace process forward. The House and the Oireachtas generally have an important role to play in what we say and how we say it, and in the leadership we can provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">To pick up on a comment which many will have noted, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Féin leader, stated on radio on Monday last that republicans are not involved in criminal actions. However, anybody would say a post office robbery is a criminal action. In that context, my thoughts moved to the question of what is and who are the IRA. When growing up in this country in the 1970s against the backdrop of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and the situation in the Republic, the IRA was considered to be "over there" while we were all "over here". To a large extent, we still see it that way. However, whether we like it or not, the IRA has grown out of and is part of our history. In ending what the IRA is and in seeing it finished and consigned to the past, there must be a process in which our community asks what is and who are the IRA within the community and what we, as civil society, must do to ensure its role is over and done with. This includes criminality.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Standing against criminality is extremely important and must be done. I know all Members in both Houses of the Oireachtas stand firmly on this issue. However, simply to state that criminality is wrong will not on its own end what the IRA is. This country has a long history in which the IRA has been part of our community. Therefore, I am not answering the question but asking what we, as a community, a society, a nation and a country, North and South, must do, and who we have to be to bring the role and presence of the IRA to an end.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_693">I salute Members for the remarkable degree of unanimity which exists among all in the House. This is a matter which touches everybody engaged in the business of politics and it is remarkable we have such similar views. We rightly salute the achievements made to date, such as the ending of paramilitary and illegal activity and the completion of the process of IRA arms decommissioning within a rapid timescale. As the Taoiseach stated, there has been agreement in regard to the full operation of the institutions of the Agreement on an inclusive basis and on a basis on which the republican community will support the new policing arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">This is fantastic progress. Who would have thought one year ago that we would be where we are now in this regard? As political opponents, Members on this side of the House greatly compliment the Taoiseach, in addition to his team, for his relentless pursuit of the goals successive Governments have tried to achieve, his immense energy and his ongoing dedication. It was stated during the debate that the Taoiseach sees the glass as very much half full, which is the spirit in which we must continue to move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">While we agree on most matters, I have some concerns. When considering illegality, which must finish completely, we must not forget the loyalist paramilitaries who have engaged in similar activities involving drugs, alcohol and so on. I share the concerns of Senator Brian Hayes in regard to the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party. We want to be all-inclusive, on which the Taoiseach remarked. However, there is a feeling, which was ventilated yesterday by Mark Durkan-——</p>

          <p eId="para_699">Fine Gael did not put down an amendment, as would be normal for a Government motion. This is in keeping with the bipartisan approach Fine Gael has taken in regard to the Northern Ireland situation through the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Senator Brian Hayes referred to the Fine Gael approach of over 30 years ago. Our policy then was the reunification of the country by peaceful means and with the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland. We were vilified by many at the time for the reference to reunification by peaceful means and the question of the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland. I am glad opinions have changed among so many members of political parties in the intervening years and that people have come around to that way of thinking. The Good Friday Agreement copper-fastens the concept that any reunification talks would be brought about only by peaceful means and would have the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">We have travelled a tremendous road and major change has taken place in Irish society in that 30 year period. We need to continue with that spirit of generosity from all sides to reach the peaceful conclusion we all want, with peace, reconciliation and harmony among all communities, North and South.</p>

That has been recognised not only in this House but also by the various parties in the North.

          <p eId="para_704">It is not that long since David Trimble was in the Vanguard Party which, given what Vanguard stood for at that time, shows the transformation in thinking that has occurred there. We now have Sinn Féin and the DUP, and everyone would wish them well. It is difficult for both those parties which will have to bring with them trenchant supporters who are committed to past ideologies. It is not easy to shift such positions. It is worthwhile investing the time in order to see that under the current leadership of both parties, this transformation will take place. That will make an agreement sustainable to a degree that might not otherwise be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">As regards Seanad reform, I do not agree with those who are suggesting that there should be an additional two Members from Northern Ireland. That will not change or effect any transformation in thinking anywhere. I also do not agree with the Seanad report that suggested an extra five Members from the North. The figure should be in the order of eight to ten but more probably ten. I say that having spoken to elected members of the UUP and the DUP. Surprisingly, they have conceded to me that they would take up such positions but only on the basis that there were sufficient numbers for them to be able to do so. In other words, that they would not be isolated within their own community. That point should be borne in mind. It is interesting that Senator Norris and others often object to that proposal on constitutional grounds. A partitionist mentality has evolved here, which sometimes has parallels with the partitionist mentality within the Unionist community. It is important for us to challenge that.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">If we want to go along the road to a united Ireland — and I am totally in favour of a united Ireland by agreement — then we must put in place the mechanisms that will enable us, first of all, to reach a mutual understanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">As regards the North-South bodies, concessions were made on Spy Wednesday, leading up the Good Friday Agreement, which significantly diluted the agreement. They were made under pressure to get all sides on board. There is a danger that that could happen again. I would prefer it to take two or three weeks longer so we would have a sustainable agreement. It is important to activate the North-South bodies. I was at a conference in Enniskillen two weeks ago where that was advocated strongly, particularly by those within the Nationalist community. It was also supported by people within the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The six areas of co-operation must also be activated because they are more meaningful and will impact more on people's lives than will the North-South bodies. We can build on that and will gradually build the Ireland we want for the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_712">I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, and his officials to the House. This is the first opportunity I have had to welcome him publicly in his new capacity. On behalf of the people of Cavan, in particular, I pay tribute to him for the work he achieved formerly as Minister for Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The Bill provides for the introduction of a series of social welfare improvements which were announced in the budget two weeks ago. The Minister has done a marvellous job in securing the largest ever budget for his Department. He has successfully secured an additional €1 billion social welfare package in this year's budget. Next year, the Department of Social and Family Affairs will oversee an expenditure in excess of €12.25 billion. That is a very welcome increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The level of social welfare expenditure is indicative of the Government's priority to protect the living standards of social welfare recipients at a time when difficult decisions must be made on the management of our public finances. Following the publication of an historic budget by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, the Government has once again demonstrated its commitment, through action rather than words, to address the needs of the elderly, widowed persons, carers, the disabled and the disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Earlier in the debate, it was interesting to hear Senator Terry welcoming the budget. It is a first for me to hear a Fine Gael representative, particularly a Front Bench spokesperson, welcoming a Fianna Fáil budget. Senator Terry said she was glad to see this was part of the new caring Fianna Fáil. Senator Cox pointed out, however, that we are a caring party and always have been. If Fine Gael has difficulty in realising that, its members have only to examine the social welfare budget which has risen from just under €6 billion in 1997 to a current minimum figure of €12.25 billion. Senator Terry is totally incorrect in trying to mislead those listening to this debate. Fianna Fáil has always been a caring party and will continue to be so. We are the real Labour Party of this country, whether Opposition Senators like it or not.</p>

          <p eId="para_728">The social welfare budget has risen by €1 billion, which is an increase of 8.8% on last year. The total spending on social welfare has more than doubled since 1997. Payments have increased by three times the expected rate of inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">A total of 1.5 million people will benefit from social welfare payments weekly. There has been a fourfold increase in child benefit since 1997.

          <p eId="para_730">I welcome the family support agency increase of €2 million for family resource centres — we have one in Cavan town that is doing great work — the €900,000 for the expansion of the family mediation service, the €600,000 additional funding for marriage and family counselling which is doing tremendous work throughout the country, the €70,000 for the development of information dissemination, and €60,000 for the second phase of family research programmes. I commend the Minister for increasing the budget of MABS which is also doing tremendous work throughout the country helping many poor and vulnerable people. I again congratulate him on his 2005 budget and wish him well in his office.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_732">The Department of Social and Family Affairs while representing a valuable source of payments, entitlements and supports, must be viewed in a broader context....[The Department] must constantly monitor the pulse of our changing society and broaden and evolve to respond to changes. As I said before in this House, the economic surge during the Celtic tiger era did not raise all boats.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">I have known the Minister for 20 years. He has a tremendous reputation for efficiency. He is an action orientated politician and his supporters are the most loyal.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryMWhite" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_735">I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the issue of child benefit and child care. I and some colleagues drew up a document on child care for the Minister for Finance. The main instrument of support for child care to date has been child benefit. Child benefit has been increased from €33 per week to approximately €35 per week. However, the cheapest community-based crèche costs €88 per week. Therefore, the sum of €35 as the chief financial support for child care is total nonsense. Furthermore, the cost of a private crèche is approximately €160 or €170 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">To address the poverty trap of the future, children aged one to four years should become the responsibility of the State and the State should look after their education as soon as they come into the world. Why do we take responsibility for children only from the age of five years until they are 21 years? The former Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley, had the vision and the imagination to introduce free secondary education and that is what opened up the country. The Government must take responsibility for educating children.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">I visited a community crèche yesterday run by Councillor Liz McCormack in Athboy. It is a sight to see children aged from three months and older getting stimulation in this way. Our children will not be able to hold their own either socially or economically with their competitors in other countries around the world in the future because child care is inaccessible. There are not enough places and it is too expensive. The Minister should put this high on his agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Child care issues cross 11 Departments. About two weeks ago I made the point in a radio interview that child care issues should be dealt with by one Department, the Department of Social and Family Affairs. This should be the number one priority if the poverty the Minister is trying to eliminate is to be prevented. When I studied this area I came to the conclusion that many of the policies have been reactive rather than visionary or part of an overall plan. We have a very serious crisis regarding the availability and accessibility of good quality child care for lone parents, middle income parents, high income parents. They all have a problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_309">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_739">I welcome the Minister to the House. I acknowledge that many aspects of the budget were welcome in that they were corrective of what was done a year ago. While Senator Wilson wildly embraces many aspects of the budget, the reality is that many of the measures in it merely compensate for the cutbacks made last year and the many stealth taxes imposed in the intervening period. The increased cost of electricity, services, gas, food and all of the other aspects of rip-off Ireland that we have heard about are the ones to which the elderly and the poor are most vulnerable. Nevertheless there are aspects of the budget that represent a welcome U-turn on decisions taken in the previous budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">It would be unfair not to acknowledge the work of the excellent personnel in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. They are more courteous and helpful than officials in many other Departments. I have noticed a very welcome change in their attitude toward people who seek help and information for them. It is very important that the people at the coalface dealing with the public should be of that frame of mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">Other Senators referred to the issue of fraud. People who commit social welfare fraud are taking from those in greatest need. That said, there is an urgent need for training for some of inspectors working in the area because it seems their goal is to humiliate the people who approach them rather than anything else. There is a need to review the process of dealing with claimants as a matter of urgency. In one instance in County Galway they are brought into a hotel in a public manner and lined up to wait for the call which is made publicly in a humiliating manner. It is time to review that process, given that the Department has offices in practically every town in the country. If there is a necessity to upgrade those to make them suitable for interviewing of this nature that is what should be done rather than the humiliation that follows from the other process.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">Recently the Society of St. Vincent de Paul indicated that it has had more calls for help this year than in any previous year. Surely that indicates that there are more people in trouble and in need of support. An organisation such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has limited resources and funding. I have had two telephone calls in the past week from people in absolute desperation. They are people to whom the Society of St. Vincent de Paul cannot provide sufficient assistance to get them through the difficult Christmas period. Many unfortunate people are being forced back into the arms of moneylenders and will find themselves in a vicious circle from which it will be difficult to escape down the line, regardless of how well social welfare schemes are resourced by the Minister's Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">It is important that these, usually illegal, moneylenders are identified and put out of business quickly. They are the ruination of many poor people, which leads to many other difficulties in society as it may force people to turn to crime in order to access money, goods or services. The work of many other charitable organisations that support the less well-off on a once-off basis at Christmas, such as the Lions Clubs and Rotary Clubs, must be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I welcome that the Minister has given €700,000 in additional funding to citizens' advice bureaux. However, it is easy to advise people on how best to spend when their resources are meagre. Nevertheless, the bureaux offer a helpful service to many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Over the last few days, and today in particular, there has been much comment on the failure of the Government to acknowledge the money that was taken illegally from many pensioners down the years. I mentioned this issue on the Order of Business and was told by the Cathaoirleach that this would be the appropriate time to discuss it. One must weigh the sum of €2,000 that is proposed to refund to each person against the efforts and endeavours of these elderly people and their families to put together savings that were taken illegally from them over a number of years in order to maintain them in long-stay residential care institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">No Government or Minister can stand back and refuse to pay back this money. People may say that a refund of €2,000 to some 20,000 pensioners represents a significant sum of money. However, pensioners have been paying approximately €8,500 per annum over a period of time in long-stay institutions. Money was taken from them by the health boards and other authorities through their pension books. Therefore, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and his colleagues in Government have a responsibility to ensure this money is paid back.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">It is not unusual, particularly in rural Ireland, for some families to have to sell the family home in order to provide for the long-term care of an elderly relative. It is important to recognise that the health boards, through some of their officers, were enthusiastic to claim and demand that these maintenance payments were made. Assessments were made against people which meant that the value of their property had to be handed over to the health boards in order to provide the care required.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">This is a serious situation. I hope 2004 will not end without the Government taking greater action than has been taken to date. The €2,000 refund is a token response and I hope the Government will go down the line and do the decent thing. If it is the case that Departments have officially robbed these elderly people, how can we point the finger at the tax collector who is going after those who have not paid their taxes? The Government is taking a major risk, as evidenced by the plea on this evening's news that people not go down the road of litigation. I hope the Government can prevent such a possibility by acting quickly in a positive way to repay the losses to so many people, particularly the elderly.</p>

          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_751">I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well in office. His Department has a highly-skilled and professional staff, some of whom have been working on the complex and varied issues relevant to the Department's work for many years. These are issues that impact significantly on communities. I spent a short time in the Department and am aware of the competence and professionalism of its staff. I hope the Minister will continue the progressive work that has been ongoing for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Senator Ulick Burke mentioned the professionalism and courtesy of staff in the regional offices. It is clear that the regionalisation of welfare services has been beneficial to customers. There may be a lesson here for other regional bodies that did not make such an effective contribution to improving the delivery of their services.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">I support what Senator Burke has said about moneylenders. Over a number of years, the Department has given substantial funding to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and MABS to deal with the blatant abuse that has been taking place in many areas, especially under-developed areas of towns and rural areas. Moneylenders should be outlawed. They are putting significant pressure on families and are behaving in an illegal fashion. Despite the efforts made to come to grips with this situation for more than a decade, the problem is not under control. I hope the Minister will make a special effort to provide additional funding to secure a mechanism that can deal with the problem and rid the country of this scourge. Moneylenders are torturing people and driving some to near suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">I stress the need to review the provision of housing for the elderly. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Health and Children, through the health boards, have been given some funding to help elderly people install such basic facilities as tiles in their showers. However, there is a sizeable number of elderly people, especially in isolated rural areas, who are living alone or with elderly relatives without basic facilities such as water and sewerage services.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The Minister might use the advice he receives from the skilled staff in regional offices to work in conjunction with health boards and county councils to tackle this problem. Despite the additional funding that has been provided, there is still a sizeable gap to be bridged in this regard. The issue is not the Minister's direct area of responsibility but he should review it in the overall context of taking care of the elderly, especially those who are ill and disabled. He might consider bringing the three Departments together to make some meaningful contribution towards resolving a problem, which has existed for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">I compliment the Department on initiatives it has taken over a number of years in encouraging people to go back to education. Last year controversial restrictions were introduced, which militated against some people continuing in the scheme. There is a growing demand for mature students to go back to education. The Minister should consider some new initiatives in that regard, considering so many people want to go back to education to allow them to set up their own business and go back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Overall the transformation in finances the Government has delivered in the past few years has been reflected in the Social Welfare Bill this year. I compliment the Minister and wish him well in the Department. I hope the benefits will continue for many years to come.</p>

        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_313">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_758">I too congratulate the Minister and wish him well. Having worked closely with the Minister in the same constituency for more than 20 years, I know his capabilities. There is no better Minister to take control of this Department and turn it around. As the Minister said, the Department of Social and Family Affairs is not about rules and regulations, but about people. Its responsibility is to reach out to those who are marginalised and disadvantaged.</p>

          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_760">I am doing that. This Bill is about helping those who cannot help themselves. The Minister has a budget of €12 billion to distribute. He has given €14 per week special increases for the lower payments, including widow's and widower's pensions, invalidity pensions, death benefits, disablement pensions, unemployment benefit, disability benefit and lone parent's allowance. He has given €12 per week increases for old-age pensions, retirement pensions, invalidity pensions, deserted wife benefit and carer's allowance. The people have welcomed these increases, which give a real safety net to those who are marginalised and cannot help themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">I reiterate a point made by Senator Daly. It is not possible for the Minister to work alone. He needs to work in a co-ordinated way with the Department of Education and Science and with local authorities on housing to determine how best to help those in need in terms of grants and loans. Somehow the elderly seem to fall through the net because they do not know whom to contact when looking for grants for extensions etc. I ask the Minister to consider this point. In my time as a local authority councillor I never knew which Department to approach when pursuing grants. I ask the Minister to streamline these processes to make it easier to help people get some quality of life. I also welcome the changes in the carer's allowance. There is no better way to bring some quality of life into communities again.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">While the Celtic tiger was roaring, somehow, as the Minister admitted, it was not the tide that lifted all the boats and did nothing for those who could not help themselves. It did not give them the chance for a standard of living and a quality of life. However, in this budget the Minister has started to address the issue and further progress will be made in the next budget. People have reflected this in their conversations with me as a public representative.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Today representatives from the European Anti-Poverty Network Ireland made a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. They complimented the Minister for making considerable progress on the matter. During the local election campaign, this was the one area that reflected badly on the Government. However, at long last we have tackled it. While the economy is growing and employment is high, a small percentage of people have somehow slipped through the net.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">I welcome what the Minister has done. I have great confidence in his ability to make it work. The public are happy with what he has done. I wish him well over the next six months in continuing what he has started. This is a success story. The Minister is bringing everybody to the quality of life they want. Education is one area on which we need to focus. If they have the standard of living then they will want to go back to education because they will have the money to give them the start. I again compliment the Minister and wish him well in the forthcoming months.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_765">I welcome the Minister to the House and I congratulate him on his new portfolio. I welcome his comments made on his appointment that he would have a more caring approach to social welfare. I hope that can be backed up with action. I have no doubt the Minister will deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Every year the public is faced with many changes following the budget. The usual hit list includes increases in pensions and social welfare, which are always to the fore. How can someone in Opposition oppose increases in old-age pensions? I come from a very rural area and many old-age pensioners find themselves having to help their grandchildren pay their way at college. While pensioners are well looked after, much of the money going to old-age pensioners is going back into the system as parents find it very difficult to maintain their children at college. At one level it is good that pensioners can hand back this money, it is also a marker with respect to the pressure on parents with children in third-level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">Child care is a major issue on which we have yet to grasp the nettle. I recently met a group from Donegal comprising women, primarily single women, with children. They do not simply need child care to allow them access to education. It is not just about getting back to education to get a qualification to allow them to enter or re-enter the job market. They need child care to allow them carry out simple tasks like going to the shop or to the doctor for a check-up. The issues raised at that meeting were child care and education. The focus has been somewhat lost. Education will not necessarily improve the way of life mean for a woman who has been in the home rearing her children on her own. It is simple basic issues such as being in a position to go shopping, to go for a social drink with their friends at least once a month or to visit their GPs for a check-up. That is the position at the margins as regards child care. There is also the issue of young couples, both of whom have to work and who are obliged to pay astronomical amounts of money in child care costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The back to education allowance used to last for 15 months but this has been reduced to 12 months. The allowance is welcome but I have been approached in recent weeks by many people working in low-skilled areas who have low to marginal incomes, who want to continue to work, who are not redundant or on unemployment assistance and who want to return to education in order to better themselves and obtain qualifications so they can improve their quality of life. The position regarding the back to education allowance must be reconsidered in respect of the many people on the margins and on low incomes who are interested in returning to education.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">During the term of office of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Coughlan, there was a great deal of bad feeling about the more radical issues that were grappled with such as widows' pensions, etc. It is not a question of disaffecting vast groups of people who are already in receipt of certain entitlements. I hope the Minister's actions will measure up to the comments he made shortly after his appointment to his new portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">It is easy to label social welfare recipients and to knock those who it is felt should not be getting handouts. Greater provision should be made in terms of linking social welfare recipients and education providers and industry by means of a system which will ensure that people do not merely receive handouts. I am aware that there are many who are not in a position to work or to avail of work. There should be increased contact with social welfare recipients to inform them, for example, about educational programmes to which they might gain entry. Many social welfare recipients are obliged, for one reason or another, to remain at home. It is important that we make provision for such people, even if it is by means of allowing them to avail of e-learning programmes offered by VECs, FÁS centres or higher education institutions. Every effort should be made to help these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">There should be more one-to-one contact with social welfare recipients. Given our bureaucratic system, there is no doubt that we have the personnel to facilitate this. It would not necessarily need to be people in citizens' advice centres or those who work in social welfare offices who offered their services in this regard. We must take a multi-agency approach which would include input from the VECs, FÁS and employers groups such as IBEC, etc., and which would cater for the needs of every social welfare recipient. People are falling through the net. There are those in receipt of social welfare payments on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis who are finding it increasingly difficult to re-enter the mainstream. Facilitating them in this regard could be as simple as getting them involved in personal development or motivational courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">I do not believe that anybody in receipt of social welfare payments wants to continue to receive them. The Minister does not need me to tell him that. Using a multi-agency approach and empowering people who are in receipt of payments will reduce the numbers of those on social welfare.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_317">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_773">I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome the Bill, which is a real achievement. The Department of Social and Family Affairs will benefit from having a strong Minister which Deputy Brennan has been throughout his career.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I wish to make a number of general points. It has become a cliché that Seán Lemass said that a rising tide lifts all boats. I worked through six volumes of his speeches in the Taoiseach's office and I could find no trace of that statement. It is to be found at the back of a book written by Brian Farrell and it is the latter's summary of what he thought Seán Lemass's philosophy to be. However, there is no direct quotation to be found. The phrase, which I have seen attributed to John F. Kennedy and others, is a serious distortion of Seán Lemass's philosophy. He was not <i>laissez faire</i>, he was an interventionist during his entire time as a Minister. There is a quotation from Lemass which sums up his philosophy and which I will, with the indulgence of the House, read into the record. It is as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_775">All human experience bears out the lesson that social justice must be organised, that Governments have the duty to intervene to protect the common good of all citizens, without preference for any individual group, although giving more attention to the less fortunate citizens who are less able to defend their rights and assert their legitimate claims; and that unless this is done indefensible inequalities persist and tend to become more widespread, including the too ready assumption that social benefits would follow automatically economic achievements, and that they would be fairly shared amongst our community.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">That is the exact opposite of the "rising tide lifts all boats" approach. Governments must intervene to lift boats that are in the channels which the rising tide will never reach.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">It is a real achievement that on budget day the Minister managed to announce a package of €874 million. However, if this is taken with what is contained in the Estimates, the increase actually amounts to over €1 billion. The 2002 budget was also quite generous and provided social welfare increases amounting to €850 million. That was the previous peak and this year's increase exceeds it. Let us compare what is happening here with what is occurring in parts of continental Europe. I visited Germany in August when a debate on serious social welfare cutbacks and the implementation of the so-called "Hartz decision" by a social democratic Government of the left was raging.  Obviously the amount of money available, consistent with sound public finances, is a reflection of sound management of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I am glad the Minister reviewed some of the measures that caused controversy last year. There cannot be movement only in one direction with nothing being changed or adapted. Often social welfare policies, particularly cutbacks, are inspired by the Department of Finance, not the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Early on in the Estimates process, a menu of cuts is presented to put pressure on the Department of Social and Family Affairs. One cannot assume that money is unlimited now or in the future, and we must pay attention to sustainability, but I hope during the Minister's tenure it will be possible for social welfare policy to be made in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and not in some section of the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The general increases were impressive, with €12 for pensioners and a larger increase of €14 for those on unemployment assistance. These increases were criticised in previous budgets and Social Welfare Bills by Fr. Seán Healy as reflecting an attitude about "the undeserving poor". As the old age pensioner reaches the €200 per week mark, it is right to give a slightly larger increase to those on the lower payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The social welfare package and the tax provisions in the budget were extraordinary. They received the praise of CORI for the first time in 20 years. I recall a conversation with Fr. Healy back in 1997 about Deputy Quinn's last budget, which he condemned as he has most budgets before and since. I asked him if he could tell me of any budget in the past ten years of which he approved to which he replied that he would need notice of that question. It is, therefore, a real achievement to have overcome that barrier.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">There is criticism of Government policy on children from two angles. I heard the head of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul say that more money should have gone to child dependants. That was dealt with in the Minister's speech and I recall a study done during the rainbow Government where the view was taken that the child dependant allowance created poverty traps that discourage people from leaving unemployment and that it was better to put money into child benefit. Child benefit has increased enormously — it is €100 more than it was in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">We must look at child care over the next year. I understand the demand by hard-pressed parents for help with that. The problem is how we avoid the providers simply putting up the price to take account of any tax concession, as has happened with the relief given in the tax code in second-hand houses for first-time buyers? That is an argument that must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">None of us is under any illusions that even with the increases it is easy for anyone to live on welfare payments. Widows of people who contributed in the pre-stamp era in the 1930s and 1940s feel they should be brought up to parity and that is a kindness the State can afford. I ask the Minister to look at that area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_784">I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome the Social Welfare Bill. The Minister has done an excellent job in the package he has brought forward. There is a total increase of €874 million, giving a budget of more than €12 billion for the Department. Anyone listening to the debate on the Order of Business this morning would imagine the Government does not care at all about the elderly. The Minister has shown his concern for the elderly and the most vulnerable in society in the way he has put this package together.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">I was glad to see the changes in the carer's allowance. This scheme has improved immensely over the years. We all remember when the carer had to live in the same house as the elderly person and could not undertake work outside the House. I supported a constituent who went to the Ombudsman because he could not work on his farm behind the house as he had to be in the house 24 hours a day to look after the person. That regulation has been relaxed and improved every year. The social welfare officers take a liberal and fair view of carers and there are opportunities for them to take up employment or get involved in education and other courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">If there are improvements in the carer's allowance, there must also be improvements in household conditions for the carer and the care recipient. Schemes for housing repairs operated by the local authorities often allow for a grant of €2,000 for improvements but the applicant must come up with €1,000 himself. That is not as easy as it sounds. The health board scheme is much better, where a contractor is engaged to do all the work and if there is contribution to be made, it is as little as €200. I was pleasantly surprised recently to discover that an applicant for a housing repair grant in County Galway who was asked to pay €1,000 had learned a year later that the health board reduced that contribution to €300.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Various Ministers have introduced many schemes over the years. I have always been intrigued by the free travel scheme, which is sometimes not of any use to people. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, was heavily involved in the rural transport initiative when he was Minister for Transport. I was present when he launched the rural transport scheme, which is of great benefit, in south-east Galway. It is important that buses are now available to bring people to catch trains or Bus Éireann buses. Schemes should suit people living in all areas, but the conventional free travel scheme does not always do so. A similar problem used to arise in respect of ESB units, which were not always available when they were most needed, particularly in winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I wish to highlight the problems faced by widows and widowers, who comprise one of the many groups of people who meet to discuss the issues affecting them, as I am sure the Minister is aware. I am amazed that such bodies do not receive as much help as people on other benefits. A farmer I know in County Galway reared five children, between the ages of two and 13, after his wife died 22 years ago. He has not received any help from the Department in the past 22 years. He was told that he would exceed the means test for a widower's pension because he has a dairy quota of a certain size. He was unfortunate because he started to pay his contributions in 1986, four years after his wife died. He will not receive a contributory pension until next year, when he will be 66. I am amazed that he was not given a retirement pension when he reached the age of 65 last June.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">It seems to me that the problem is that while pensioners receive <i>pro rata</i> pensions, such pensions are not given to those who receive widow’s or widower’s allowances. I ask the Minister to examine this matter. We have been very supportive of pensioners. We have allowed pre-1953 contributions and contributions from Great Britain and other EU countries to be added on. That has been an effective way of ensuring that pensioners receive <i>pro rata</i> pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">Means testing arrangements have improved as a result of changes in old age pension provisions and other disability allowances. There have been good increases in schemes such as farm assist, which is a very good scheme. The Minister for Finance has ensured that it has been of great help. I would like to discuss an initiative I think I have clarified with the Department. Concern was expressed that the special savings incentive account scheme, which is an excellent scheme, might cause difficulties for people when they were being means tested. The Minister has dealt with cases of people who have no other income. That is useful because it can be difficult to tell people that a scheme of this nature, which one has endorsed, might work against them, for example by causing them to lose some or all of their payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">The Minister might feel that people are disappointed when they receive a small pension or a small unemployment assistance payment. Those who receive unemployment assistance or farm assist payments of €4 or €5 can qualify for the community employment scheme or the new rural social scheme as a result. We should not forget that people are often happy to receive a small payment if it helps them to participate in a scheme that helps them to improve themselves. Newspaper headlines often state that certain applicants have been given just €5 or €6. While such payments are small, they are often stepping stones to allow people to become involved in a particular scheme under which good work can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">I welcome the comments of Senators. I hope the Minister will continue his reform of the social welfare regime. We look forward to next year, when some of the issues being addressed in the Seanad might be tackled by the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_319">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. S. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_793">I thank Senators for their kind contributions, to which I will respond. In particular, I thank those who took the time to thank the officials and staff of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I support the comments that were made in that regard. I assure the House, having worked in six or seven Departments, that the officials with whom I am working at present, who are dealing with difficult matters, are of the highest calibre and courtesy. I share the views expressed by Senators in that regard and thank them for mentioning this aspect of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">I reiterate that the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which has a budget of over €12.2 billion, spends more money than any other Department. Of every €3 that will be spent by the Government next year, almost €1 will be spent by the Department. It is obvious that its services are important for many people. Approximately 970,000 social welfare payments are made every week. Payments have increased by over three times the rate of inflation this year. We need to sustain these achievements into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">Senators Terry, Cox, McCarthy, White, Kitt and others spoke about carers. The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs produced a report on the position of full-time carers, which stated, "the greatest need identified by family carers is the need for a break from caring, in home respite and respite for the dependent person." Having considered the conclusion seriously, I have announced that a grant of €1,000 will be awarded, for the first time, to all carers who provide full-time care to an older person or a person with a disability, regardless of their means. The grant of €1,000, which will not be means-tested, is a way of recognising widows and other pensioners who may or may not be in receipt of a social welfare payment. Some 33,000 carers will receive the grant of €1,000, regardless of whether they are in receipt of such a payment, in recognition of their role as carers. I have made changes to the respite care grant, which will now be payable in respect of each person for whom the carer is caring. We have altered the various thresholds to include additional people. The capital assessment sum has been increased from approximately €12,000 to €20,000 to allow extra people to be taken into the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Many Senators asked me to abolish the means test for carers, which would cost approximately €160 million. We should acknowledge that there are different opinions on the matter — I do not consider that the abolition of the means test for carers is warranted. If I had €160 million, I would use it to focus on areas in which it is needed. I would not use it to remove everybody from the means test, as that would be too crude. If we get to a point where we can afford it, we will focus the funds on those whose means have demonstrated that they require the funds. That would be a better use of such moneys. The carers' package, which is worth approximately €40 million, is the most significant that has been produced for many years. I remind the House that the €1,000 grant will be given to all carers, including widows who have made a special case for the recognition of their care, and not just to carers who are in receipt of carer's allowance at present. We may be in a position to give a top-up of some sort to widows in the future, but for the moment the grant of €1,000 is an immediate way of recognising what they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">A number of Senators spoke about rent supplement. I confirm that I have abolished the six-month rule in favour of an assessment by the housing authority. If the authority is of the view that one is in immediate need of accommodation, one will get rent supplement. That is a fair way to do it. One used to be deemed ineligible for rent supplement after one had rejected two offers of accommodation, but I have changed that provision so that one can turn down a housing offer three times and still be eligible for rent allowance. That is very reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Many Senators referred to family income supplement, which is given to 14,600 families who receive an average payment of €72.19 each week. The Minister for Finance announced in the budget that the threshold for the benefit will be increased by €39 this year. This will result in a weekly increase of €23.40 for almost all families eligible to receive the supplement and it will enable 2,500 more families to become eligible. The tax system is not capable of identifying automatically the householders who are entitled to it but we are working on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The one-parent family transitional half-rate payment was mentioned by Senator Terry. Some 7,000 one-parent families are expected to benefit from the new six-month transition payment. I take the Senator's point that I did not make complete changes to some of the schemes. I amended them as I saw fit. In this case, I am satisfied that a six-month transitional payment is adequate. When a lone parent begins to work, the overlap is accounted for. A lone parent can now earn up to €293 per week and still be entitled to some element of the benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The back to education allowance was discussed in the Dáil in recent days, including during Question Time today. In the budget package, I changed the qualifying period for the back to education third level option from 15 months to 12 months, which is costing €2.5 million this year. I stated in the Dáil that I would examine whether the qualifying period could, in the coming months, be reduced further to nine months, and I will do this. It is not very urgent because the academic year usually begins in September. Once we have made a firm decision by then, we will be all right. The qualifying period for entry into second level education has not been affected and remains at six months. We increased the grant pertaining to the back to education allowance from €254 to €400.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">What informs my decisions in all these matters is my desire to make it easy to make the transition between unemployment and work, or unemployment and education. The transition should be seamless. Much work has been done in this area, as Senator Daly stated. However, I would like to do more to ensure that individuals are not locked in a welfare trap such that they would not benefit much if they took up employment or would not benefit at all if they went back to education. I need to remove those traps and am working on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">Many Senators referred to child benefit. Senator Cox shared my view that child benefit is not the answer to child care. Some 520,000 families are receiving child benefit in respect of over 1 million children. The allocation for this year is €1.9 billion, representing an increase of €136 million. The child benefit is a very important income for the recipients. It is clear from the fact that no Government has increased the child dependant allowance since 1994 that a view has been formed by successive Governments that child benefit is a better way to direct the funds towards children. That there is almost €2 billion being allocated to 520,000 families means the scheme is having an impact. However, it is not the answer to child care because child care is a multidepartmental, multifaceted issue involving matters of supply and taxation and various other measures. Societal change is a factor in child care, and child benefit, or the children's allowance, as it used to be called, was not meant to deal with it. The involvement of the State in child care is partly a 21st century phenomenon.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">I know the Senator has done much work in this area. Child care has many aspects. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently announced that it has substantial funds available to lead a child care programme. The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Finance and I need to work together to ensure there is an integrated child care strategy available to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Fraud was mentioned. In 2003, savings of €306 million were achieved through the very good work of over 600 full-time staff who conducted over 320,000 reviews. They examined the files of over 7,500 employers. These figures indicate that we are committed to eliminating fraud from the system. We want to do so for the obvious reason that it will enable more money to be allocated to genuine people.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The Money Advice and Budgeting Service was alluded to. This year, it has €13.62 million available to it, which is an increase of €2.2 million on the previous year. I have given the service a special grant of €700,000 to make up for last year's apparent deficit of €700,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">I have taken careful note of the points made by Senators Burke, Ormonde and Kitt and will deal with them as best I can. Senator Mansergh has upended one marvellous myth in the Seanad tonight, namely, that Seán Lemass is not on record as having made the famous statement that a rising tide lifts all boats. I am sure many a quotation is ascribed to Shakespeare that cannot be found in his literature. If one reads carefully what I said in the Dáil when I took up office as Minister for Social and Family Affairs, one will note that I stated I disagreed with Seán Lemass. A rising tide does not lift all boats and one has to intervene. I agree with Senator Mansergh that Mr. Lemass was an interventionist and intervened in many areas of the economy. He believed in intervening where necessary, as I do, not for the sake of it or to produce the planned economy which has not been too successful in parts of eastern Europe but to lift boats that are not rising. Senator Mansergh also stated that social welfare policy should be made by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and not by the Department of Finance. I plan to make certain of this during my tenure.</p>

            <p eId="para_814">I wish to highlight the need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to indicate her Department's plans for the Bon Secours hospital, formerly the Grove Hospital, in Tuam. It was purchased by the Western Health Board over five years ago and is now lying abandoned. Will she indicate whether plans submitted by the health board have been approved by her Department?</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The Western Health Board bought the property when the Bon Secours group decided to pull out of Tuam. It was a fine hospital and provided wonderful service to the people of Tuam, north Galway, south Mayo and north-west Roscommon. When this issue arose, there was a clear indication that the health board, in conjunction with the then Minister, Deputy Martin, would proceed quickly to revamp and re-plan the facility in Tuam as a community hospital. The health board, of which I was a member, met the Minister in this regard, after which he bought facilities. The Bon Secours facility was closed down immediately and chains were put on the gate. The building is semi-derelict today despite the wonderful plans of the health board to remove the present structure, re-plan the site and provide other community facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">The local action group on various occasions, as Senator Kitt knows, said it was a pity the facilities there could not be used for out-patients, clinics and related services. That has not been done. The upkeep and maintenance by the health board must be a sizeable contract for somebody. My greatest fear is that the decision and announcement of the Minister for Health and Children will be to investigate all property and lands owned by the health board with a view to selling off any that are surplus to requirement. The Minister has failed to develop the property or give any indication that it will be developed despite the Taoiseach's visit before the election when he announced there would be a hospital in Tuam within one year of that visit. That has not happened several years down the line from that promise.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">I hope to hear an answer from the Minister tonight to the effect that the extensive and wonderful plans the health board submitted to the Department will be approved and that she will indicate that whatever properties the health board and the Department have in County Galway, particularly in Tuam, are not for sale but will be developed very soon. We know of the serious shortage in the community of bed capacity and the other services provided by the private hospital in the past. The action group that requested this worked supportively with the town council, the Western Health Board and the public representatives to ensure that the Minister would purchase it on the day, as he did. That was widely welcomed and the plans were submitted to the Department but I cannot find out what has happened to them, or whether they are being accepted.</p>

            <p eId="para_818">I thank Senator Ulick Burke for sharing his time. I was delighted when the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, announced he was purchasing the old Bon Secours Hospital and surrounding grounds in Tuam. It was a very particular project for the Western Health Board of which Senator Ulick Burke and I were members at the time. We fought very hard to have this property taken over and for a hospital to be built in Tuam. The application was sent to the Department in September 2002, over two years ago so we expected that we would have received an answer by now.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">Many of the scares about this property were sparked when we heard reports that some of the Merlin Park lands in Galway of which the Minister is aware were to be sold. Whatever about the merits or demerits of that proposal, I could never understand the proposals to sell the lands and the hospital in Tuam, formerly the Bon Secours Hospital or "The Grove" as it is known locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">I hope the Minister will tell us that the Department is proceeding to develop those lands. If the Hanly report means anything for community hospitals — and it is not always popular to talk about it — surely it means that Tuam would be an ideal centre for a hospital as it has the required population of over 30,000, being the catchment area of north Galway and south Mayo. This is why I strongly support the idea of the hospital. I was born in that hospital and have often said I do not want it to be the political death of me. I do not want it to go down in history as something that causes us all political grief. There is a strong desire in the community to see that hospital continue in the town of Tuam.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. S. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_821">Following the closure by the Bon Secours Order of "The Grove" hospital in Tuam, the Western Health Board, which is responsible, in the first instance, for the provision of health services in the Tuam area, decided to build a new 50-bed community hospital on the grounds and adjoining land to replace the existing facility. This new hospital will comprise a mix of up to 30 beds for continuing care with the remaining beds made up of direct access beds, rehabilitation, convalescent, respite and palliative care beds. In line with what is generally provided in the board's district hospitals, the service will have a significant mix of multidisciplinary staff, including medical, nursing, nursing support, paramedical, as well as other complementary therapists. Coupled with this, the board envisages the Tuam hospital functioning as the hub of a comprehensive outreach service, providing homecare programmes, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, home nursing, home help, as well as other flexible packages of care. These specialist care services will, of course, be supported by social support services such as community welfare and home advisory programmes. Further advice is being sought on the possibility of using the hospital for other health-related facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">The Government has made services for older people a priority and is fully committed to the development of a comprehensive health service which is capable of responding quickly, fully and effectively to the health service needs of older people. In recent years, health and social services for older people have improved, both in hospitals and in the community. Since coming into office, this Government has substantially increased the level of funding, both capital and revenue, in respect of services for older people. For example, the amount of additional revenue funding has increased from €12.7 million in 1997, to €100 million in 2003 with a further €9.5 million being allocated this year. This figure is being increased to over €15 million for 2005. This serves to demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to improving services for our older population.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">Significant capital funding for the health sector has been provided since the commencement of the national development plan in 2000. Total expenditure for the years 2000-03 was approximately €1.7 billion. Considerable progress has been made in addressing the historical deficits in health infrastructure and improving the standards of facilities required for quality modern patient care. The national development plan provides considerable capital funding to services for older people. On a national basis, this will enable a comprehensive infrastructure of community nursing units and day care facilities to be put in place as well as the refurbishment of existing extended care facilities and the replacement of old workhouse-type accommodation. Older people deserve first class facilities and we intend to provide such facilities in appropriate locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">The Department of Health and Children is examining the health capital programme for 2004 and beyond to ascertain what new projects can be progressed through either planning or construction stages, taking account of existing commitments and overall funding resources available. In this context my Department will continue to liaise with the Western Health Board regarding the proposed development in Tuam in the light of the board's overall capital funding priorities.</p>

            <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
            <p eId="para_826">I wish to share my time with Senator Ulick Burke. This issue concerns Cahergal national school near Tuam, County Galway. Before the last general election several schools in north Galway sought improvements and some wanted new developments. Under the pilot or devolved programme many of those schools and their boards of management have had their wishes fulfilled and work is in progress in several areas such as Briarfield, Newtown and Barnaderg national school.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">Cahergal national school has had a serious problem because of increased numbers and the board of management cannot proceed with the devolved programme until it gets extra lands. Land is available beside the school which would be very suitable for purchase and development. The school enrolment has increased over recent years and the figures for next year also show an increase as the school is near Tuam and many students from the greater catchment area are travelling there. It has an excellent staff but sadly the buildings are not in good condition. We have had several meetings there and we were hopeful when the devolved programme came about that this school would qualify. It qualified, but it is a catch-22 situation in that they need land for further development. I hope that the Minister can set the record straight here in the House regarding the acquisition of those lands and allow the devolved programme or pilot scheme to continue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_333">
            <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
            <p eId="para_828">I thank Senator Kitt for sharing time with me. I wholeheartedly support his proposal. I raised this issue approximately two years ago, and Senator Kitt shared time with me on that occasion too.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">This time around, it is important to highlight the fact that, in previous years, when anything was attempted regarding an upgrade of the school at Cahergal, the expansion of the site was the stumbling block. On this occasion, the land is available, and it is of the utmost importance that the Department move quickly to take that on board, acquire the land and move on to the next stage. It will never happen unless additional land is bought for expansion.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">The site, as Senator Kitt has said, is overcrowded, cluttered and dangerous because of the numbers of students, the criss-crossing between prefabs and the only open recreational area available to the pupils. The board of management, principal, staff and parents' groups have made a tremendous effort to move the matter on. On various occasions, they thought they were near to a solution and, on one occasion, thought they would move to a new greenfield site. However, the Department said the best strategy was to expand on site.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">Now that the opportunity to do so has presented itself, it is of the utmost importance that the Department moves quickly, purchases the land and carries out the necessary expansion work to the school which is under tremendous pressure as the area is one of increasing population and pupil intake. That is likely to continue because of the expansion of Galway city into the area. It is a new growth centre if ever there was one, and there is a great need for school places. Many of the facilities that other schools have are denied the pupils of the area, such as computer rooms, general purpose rooms, and the other support mechanism spaces required in modern education. It is important that the Minister impresses on his colleague the importance of moving quickly to acquire the site.</p>

            <p eId="para_832">I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the proposals of the Department of Education and Science regarding the proposed development at Cahergal national school, Tuam, County Galway.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">The board of management of Cahergal national school, Tuam, applied to the Department of Education and Science for the provision of four new classrooms to replace existing facilities. In view of the prospective difficulties in providing an optimum range of accommodation in the context of the current site, which measures 0.5 acres, the board of management was requested to explore the possibility of procuring additional land adjacent to the existing site for the purpose of facilitating an extension.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">In March 2000, the school authorities confirmed that none of the surrounding lands was available for sale and formally applied for the provision of a new school on a greenfield site. Following a meeting between representatives of Cahergal national school and the Department of Education and Science, the property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department for site acquisitions, was requested to investigate the possibility of acquiring a site for the school. I understand that a suitable site has now been identified and that negotiations are at an advanced stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">The school authorities have also decided to partake in the Department's small schools initiative, which allows small primary schools to undertake building and modernisation works on a devolved basis. I thank the Senator once again for raising this matter in the House.</p>

            <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
            <p eId="para_836">I would like to raise an issue regarding Scoil Mhuire in Dristernan. Looking at the name of the place, one would be tempted to pronounce it with the stress on the second vowel, but the proper pronunciation near Gleneely in north Inishowen rhymes with "Tristran". This issue was brought to my attention by a colleague of mine, Councillor Bernard McGuinness of north Inishowen.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_337">
            <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
            <p eId="para_838">I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and concur with his remark. The councillor is certainly working on the ground and knows the local issues, one of which is this national school which has sought very basic improvements to the standards of facilities and infrastructure for the past 20 years. To be honest, the board of management and staff may have sat back, waited and hoped that it would happen eventually but, 20 years later, their dissatisfaction, frustration and anger have become intolerable. The infrastructural deficits include the following: children falling on damp and slippery floors; teachers complaining of inadequate toilet facilities; the lack of a proper staff room; a small, poky cold toilet shared by eight adults; no space in the small, poky staff room; and little storage space. If there is supposed to be an emphasis on exercise and health, it is not there in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">I will not delay the Minister much further regarding this very simple issue. The staff and board of management of the school have been waiting too long. I know that this is not the Minister's brief, but I know that he will be conveying my concerns to the Minister for Education and Science. The procrastination at a departmental level is unbelievable. The matter has been passed from pillar to post. It has been promised and approved. The extension has had planning permission for the past three years, but now the school has been asked to review the planning application and make changes. Funding was approved and granted in 1999, but the school is still on the bottom rung of the ladder.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">As I said, the school is in a small, rural area in north Inishowen. The people who live there believe in rural communities and the rural way of life. It is possible that they do not shout loudly enough, and perhaps the matter should be highlighted here. I know of many schools that have waited three, four, five or six years, but this school has waited 20 years. For justice to be served, the matter must be addressed. The issue that always crops up is the Department of Education and Science. The waiting game whereby building programmes are put on the long finger must be seriously addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_841">On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to outline to this House the proposals of his Department regarding the proposed refurbishment and extension project at Scoil Mhuire national school, Dristernan, Gleneely, Inishowen, County Donegal.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">The school authorities applied to the Department for the provision of an extension and the refurbishment of the existing building. I am pleased to inform the Senator that a full design team has been appointed and the architectural planning process has commenced. The introduction of a multi-annual funding process for school building projects requires a revised approach to how projects are scheduled through the design process and on to tender and construction. To maintain a smooth flow of projects and ensure that the optimum number of projects is ready to go to tender and construction at any given time, the Department of Education and Science will progress on a priority basis those projects at an early design stage such as Scoil Mhuire. The Department will provide further details of those projects and notify the schools concerned in the new year. In this way, the Department seeks to create sustained momentum in the schools building programme to match the Government's multi-annual funding commitment.</p>
