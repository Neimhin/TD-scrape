          <p eId="para_12">I congratulate the Chairman on his appointment and I look forward to working with everyone on the committee. We should, at the earliest opportunity, see what we can do to address the refugee and migrant crisis. I know that is for another day because today we are dealing with the Revised Estimates. The crisis in Europe and on its borders needs to be the absolute focus of this committee. We must also look at the EU-Turkey deal and how it impacts on the rights of refugees. The refugee and migrant crisis should be our main focus between now and the summer recess.</p>

          <p eId="para_18"> Deputy Darragh O'Brien mentioned the migration crisis. Earlier this morning, I discussed that matter with our officials. A UN migration summit will take place in September and will be chaired by Ireland and Jordan. When we know the identities of the Senators who will serve on the joint committee and as soon as the latter is formed, the migration issue will be one of the first subjects that will be discussed. There are many pressing issues in terms of the migration issue as a whole. I can confirm that we discussed the matter this morning.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">The Dáil, on 16 June 2016, ordered that the Revised Estimates for Public Services in respect of Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Vote 27 - International Co-operation, be referred to the select committee for consideration. At today's meeting, the committee will consider these Estimates and report back to the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development, Deputy Joe McHugh. I congratulate both of them on their appointments. I look forward to working closely with them over the term of the Thirty-second Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> I also welcome the officials from the Department to today's meeting and thank them for the detailed briefing material provided to the committee. The proposed format of today's meeting is that we will hear brief opening remarks from the Minister before proceeding to deal with Vote 28 on a programme by programme basis. At the outset of the consideration of each of the programmes, the Minister can give an overview of the programme, including detailing any pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance or expenditure in relation to the programme this year. We will then open the discussion up to the floor for questions from members of the committee. On completion of Vote 28, we will proceed to Vote 27 and consider it in a similar manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Before proceeding to the business of the meeting, I remind members and those in the public Gallery that their mobile phones should be switched off completely for the duration of the meeting, as they cause interference with the recording equipment in committee rooms even if on silent mode. Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the House, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to make brief opening remarks on the overall expenditure of the Department before proceeding to examine Vote 28.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2016-06-23T09:15:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_24">I will start by congratulating you on your recent appointment as Chairman of this committee and I also congratulate the members of the reconfigured committee for the Thirty-second Dáil. I look forward to engaging with the committee not only today but in future months and, dare I say, years.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Under the programme for a partnership Government, this Government is committed to reform of the budgetary process, including pre-budget consideration, better scrutiny of Revised Estimates and better evaluation of programmes. We, in government, look forward to having the valuable input of the committee in this process as it develops.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> I will briefly refer to Vote 28, which I will deal with as it relates to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, will then address the committee on Vote 27, international co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> As you are aware, Chairman, Vote 28 funds the operation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its network of 81 missions, excluding African missions and Vietnam, which come under Vote 27, Ireland's contributions to international organisations such as the UN budget, UN peacekeeping operations, the OECD, the OSCE, and the Council of Europe, among others, and a number of smaller programmes such as the emigrant support programme, the peace and reconciliation fund and other funding programmes in areas such as culture, education and trade promotion.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Members will have seen the advance briefing provided by my Department which summarises the main activities and priorities under each strategic programme and which includes actual expenditure under each programme to the end of May 2016. For 2016, the committee will be aware that the overall gross estimate for the foreign affairs and trade group of Votes, Votes 27 and 28, is €698 million compared with €686 million in 2015, an overall increase of €12 million or 1.6%. A total of €10 million of the total increase represents an increase in the international co-operation Vote, Vote 27, with the balance of €2 million on Vote 28, which is earmarked in particular for the passport reform programme. The gross budget for Vote 28 has increased to €212 million from €210 million in 2015. A total of 71% or €150 million of the Vote 28 allocation is for administrative costs with the balance of 29%, or €62 million, allocated to programme subheads.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I believe that represents good value for money. The overall trend in recent years has been one of significant reduction in the Department's administration budget which is down by 22% or €43 million in 2016 compared with 2008. Most of that is accounted for by administrative savings on salaries and on the cost of maintaining our diplomatic network. Our mission network serves our citizens, our businesses and our Government well. It is a small one by international standards and by comparison with like-sized countries and our missions are small. A total of 15% of our 80 missions are staffed by one diplomat while 40% are staffed by two diplomats with support from local staff. Denmark, with a similar population, has 108 missions in its diplomatic network. Finland's foreign Ministry employs more than 2,600 staff at home and abroad compared to a total of just under 1,500 in Ireland's case.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> The programme structure for Vote 28 is somewhat different from the situation in 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">The current structure is based on the Department's statement of strategy for the period 2015 to 2017 which is rooted in the recent foreign policy review document, The Global Island: Ireland's Foreign Policy for a Changing World. The latter sets out the Department's work in five priority areas: supporting our people; promoting our values; advancing our prosperity; engaging actively in the European Union; and strengthening our influence. These correspond directly with the longer-worded descriptions for programmes A to E in the published Revised Estimates Volume.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> We are nearly halfway through the year already. In the course of my remarks this morning on the individual programmes, I will seek to address some of the work under way in each of the areas, how expenditure is going so far this year and the factors and pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance across the programmes in 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The Department is experiencing a number of cost and exchange rate pressures mainly driven by our global presence. In particular the weak euro, while a major advantage to exporters, is adding significant costs to operating in key markets and engaging with strategic partners. It is estimated that in 2015 currency exchange rates cost the Department almost €10 million extra in euro terms. In addition, the recovering economies around the world have increased local costs driven by rising inflation and local market conditions. My Department is also incurring increased security costs at overseas missions as we seek to ensure the safety of staff and visitors to our premises - both Irish citizens and others - following the various terror attacks across the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> With the Chairman's agreement, I now propose to make some short introductory comments on programme A, and to open out the discussion and invite comments or questions from members. Once we complete our discussion on the programme, I will then take each of the subsequent programmes in sequence.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">Work under the programme includes: the effective delivery of passport and consular services for citizens; supporting emigrants; deepening engagement with the diaspora; sustaining peace and enhancing reconciliation and political progress in Northern Ireland; increasing North-South and British-Irish co-operation; and promoting our culture, arts and creative industries throughout our embassy network. The amount allocated for the programme in 2016 is €67.3 million, compared to €63.9 million in 2015. The programme is about our people and it covers a number of key priority areas for the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Given the breadth of issues covered by the programme I will just briefly touch on some of them in my introduction. The first relates to consular services and consular assistance. Providing high quality consular assistance and other consular services to Irish citizens at home and abroad is a key objective of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The number of Irish citizens travelling abroad has increased sharply in recent years. We are seeing a most significant increase in the level of requests for consular assistance from the consular division in Dublin and across the mission network overseas. In 2015 we provided assistance in 2,500 separate cases, including more than 250 cases of deaths abroad, and a similar number of hospitalisation cases. That represents a 20% increase in the workload compared to 2014. Statistics for 2016, to date, suggest an even sharper increase, of close to 40% in demand in the past 12 months. We also note a greater frequency of responses to major emergency incidents and critical crisis events. I need hardly recall the deaths of six young men and women in Berkeley or the murder of three Irish citizens in Tunisia a year ago this month. We are conscious also of the increased threat of terrorism in Europe, as demonstrated by the Paris and Brussels attacks, which resulted, unfortunately, in a number of Irish citizens being injured. Much of the work the Department does in the area is less visible, including work that is of a preventative or precautionary nature. We dedicate significant attention to research and communication in the area of travel advice to ensure citizens can make informed decisions about travel and are forewarned of the risks involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> As members are aware, extensive preparations were put in place for the tens of thousands of Irish and Northern Irish fans in France for the European championships. We are all immensely proud of the hugely positive press and social media coverage our fans have been receiving. We could not buy that positive coverage. It is quite remarkable that the events in France are ongoing. We congratulate the team on last night's performance and look forward to further events over the weekend and into next week. A similar level of consular assistance operation is being put in place for Brazil for the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games that are coming up shortly. This area of our work is also driving forward our pursuit of new and innovative means of supporting Irish citizens abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> On the eve of Euro 2016 on 10 June, I was proud to launch the TravelWise smartphone app, which is an important new state-of-the-art tool for improving our communications with the travelling public, ensuring that we keep our citizens safe and well informed while they are abroad. It provides full access to all of our travel advice content, even offline, instant access to our network of 80 permanent embassies and consulates, as well as more than 90 honorary consuls worldwide and it enables us to contact citizens to alert them about major incidents and/or changes in security levels in countries where they are travelling or in which they have already registered an interest in visiting. I recommend this travel app to all members and encourage them to promote it among family, friends and constituents. The feedback relating to it has been remarkably positive. I trust that the app is already in full use on the smartphones - of course, those in the room have all been turned off - of all elected Members of the Oireachtas. I ask members to check their phones as we conclude the meeting. Officials from my Department are here to offer assistance in ensuring that the downloads have been adequately and properly effected.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> I will now deal with passport reform. In 2015 the Department issued 670,000 passports and 13,500 passport cards, representing a 6.4% increase over 2014. To date this year, 434,000 passport book application have already been received and we are 12% ahead of the number of applications made at the same point last year. The passport card - the first of its type in the European Union - was introduced last year for adult holders of Irish passports and has received the most positive endorsement. As members may know, I launched a significant investment in the passport service to modernise the issuing of passports, improve security and enhance the service provided to citizens. The passport reform programme, involving a combined capital and current budget of €18.6 million, will run from 2016 to 2018. An additional €3.75 million has been allocated for the programme in 2016. I trust the Chairman and all members are adequately equipped with passport cards for ease of travel. I know this committee will be engaging in a considerable amount of travel during the term of the Chairman's tenure and I trust all of the members have been issued with their passport cards. They are very useful. Again, the feedback from the general public has been particularly positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> The emigrants support programme provides funding to non-profit organisations and projects in order to support Irish communities overseas and to facilitate the development of more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish. I am pleased to say that funding for 2016, at €11.6 million, remains the same as previous years. The organisations funded provide a range of services from informal community networks and groups for seniors to outreach services and advice in accessing entitlements. The programme also supports projects aimed at creating practical, results-oriented links between Ireland and the global Irish and projects that emerge as a consequence of the work of the Global Irish Economic Forum such as, for example, the development of Irish business alumni and affinity networks. Applications for 400 projects, received from over 230 organisations under the emigrant support programme, are currently being assessed. It is anticipated that the 2016 project allocations will be approved in the coming weeks and that the target of funding more than 200 organisations in 2016 will be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> In regard to the relationship between Ireland and the UK, today's referendum is uppermost in all of our minds. The position of the Government is quite clear. We want the UK, as our friend, closest neighbour and partner, to remain a member of a reformed European Union but we fully respect that, first and foremost, this is a decision for the UK voters which they are making today as we speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> As already stated, the programme deals with matters relating to Northern Ireland and delivers funding for projects to bolster peace and reconciliation across the island. The maintenance of peace, stability and economic growth in Northern Ireland remains an absolute priority for the Government. The Government is committed to the full implementation of Stormont House Agreement and A Fresh Start, which provide a framework for continued progress. The reconciliation fund is on track to finance over 100 civil society and community organisations in 2016, drawing on the €2.7 million budget allocation. More than 450 events have taken place around the world, supported by the Department and its embassy network as part of Ireland's 2016 global and diaspora programme, marking the centenary of the Easter Rising.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">These events have been very well received both at home and abroad. We are now in the fifth year of the decade of centenaries 1912-1922, marking the events of a century, which shaped the past 100 years of Irish life.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> In the matter of culture, the Department's overseas mission network continues to organise and support events of a cultural nature which promote Ireland. Funding has been provided for 266 such events in the first half of 2016 and we will meet our target of 300 value-adding events in this regard over the period of a year. With regard to the trends in expenditure to the end of May, the expenditure on this programme remains on target. However, due to the significant rise in passport applications, the passport service is experiencing significant cost pressures. My Department has deployed additional temporary clerical officers and increased overtime to facilitate increased production on an issue that I know all members of the committee are concerned about and we are anxious to ensure an efficient service delivery to all the applicants. I might add that the increased passport issuance has result in increased non-pay costs in passport book application forms and ICT costs. Currently the passport service is approximately €3 million ahead of its budget profile. My officials will continue to closely monitor this demand-led programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">I thank the Minister and propose that we join him in extending our heartiest congratulations to the Irish team, management and supporters who have the privilege of being in France. They have all been and continue to be great ambassadors for our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> With regard to passports, members receive representations daily in regard to new passports or the renewal of passports. The Minister referred to the ongoing programme of reform and my understanding is that a new online passport system will be introduced. Will he outline in his response how this reform is progressing and what it will mean for Irish citizens to have the new online passport system? In regard to his concluding remarks on Northern Ireland and the British referendum, a number of us in this room represent Border constituencies. In his earlier remarks, he referred to the pressures on the Department with regard to currency exchange rates. We sincerely hope that after the decision of the electorate in Britain today we are not back to that being an issue for the people on this island, particularly those of us who live in Border counties and who grew up with the disruption caused by Border controls in terms of the control of persons crossing either North-South or South-North.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> I propose to group the questions together and the Minister may respond to all at the end. Is that okay?</p>

          <p eId="para_52">I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment. I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh also on his appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> I know that we are moving towards an online passport service; will that include a reminder system as well, similar to what applies to road tax and various other services?</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> It would be of interest to note what percentage approximately of applications received by the passport office are incomplete. I hope the online application will actually ensure full completion of applications. I take this opportunity to commend the staff in the passport office because I know they are under ferocious pressure and I have contributed to some of that. It is a very stressful time but if we can provide an online service that would be something.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> My final point relates to the public service card and the requirement for new or renewal applications to have the public service card. Is the Department liaising with other Departments in that regard because we are finding that people who are not aware of that requirement have to seek appointments for the public service card as well? I understand that 1.8 million people have received the card so far, as I learned from a response to a parliamentary question I tabled.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I have a number of questions on programme A. The expenditure so far on emergency consular assistance to May 2016 is €1 million whereas the target is €79 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Is there a reason for that? Are there expenditures pushed out into the second half of the year that are not shown in the Estimates?</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> My final question on programme A relates to North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation. The Minister might inform me as to when the next North-South Ministerial Council meeting is being held. In particular, I am interested in the all-island bodies that fall under his remit and how the Minister oversees their work programme and targets. There is a feeling out there - it may not be a fair one - that we may not be getting from the all-island structures all that we could and that the potential of those bodies to work for all the people on the island of Ireland is not yet being met. It appears that over the course of the past year, obviously because of the electoral cycles, that it slipped off the agenda. I am particularly interested to hear the Minister's views on a work programme in that regard, what targets are being set, how we are interacting and how the Department interacts with the all-island bodies, which were brought forward in the Good Friday Agreement, to ensure that we are using them for the good of all the people of Ireland and to reach their potential.</p>

          <p eId="para_60"> Is there space for new organisations to apply for funding or are we funding the same organisations that we have funded historically? Is there a space if somebody else is looking for funding? For example, on North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation, we have met quite a number of the groups. I was a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and some of these groups are in existence for quite a while. I wonder whether there is an audit of them and if the Minister looks at them with a fresh eye each time they apply. I am conscious this morning of the story that has broken about governance issues in another organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> My other question also relates to the North. There are difficulties and there are people who feel left behind by the Good Friday Agreement. I wonder whether there is a space within this programme. As the Minister will be aware, some of us have been visiting Maghaberry prison and other prisons and engaging with both loyalist and republican dissidents. I ask whether there is a space within this programme for working with that particular group because it is in everybody's interest that there is a conflict-free environment.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelGrealishPD" eId="spk_17">
          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2016-06-23T09:35:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_62">First, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, on his reappointment, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, on his appointment to the Department. I have worked with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, on a few occasions. It is always a pleasure to work with him and also with the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> I concur with what my colleague said in complimenting the staff in the passport office. They do an excellent job. In any contact I have with them, they always try to facilitate people who, when they have booked their tickets, including flights and hotels, at the last moment check their passports. I still cannot understand that. It is a big issue in many Members' offices as the first port of call is to ring the local Deputy to see what can be done. As the Minister will be aware, on every occasion in the run-up to an election, it is the practice to ask the public to check the register. Can such a campaign be run in this case? I issue a press release at the start of every year asking constituents to check their passports and many of them still do not do so. Can there be such a campaign asking those travelling abroad to check their passports before they book? It is the first thing someone travelling abroad should do.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> I note the Minister stated that there is an increase in passport applications. Is much of that from second or third generation Irish outside the jurisdiction? Has there been an increase in applications from the United Kingdom? The Minister might have that information for us as well. He might also state what country, other than the Republic of Ireland, has the most Irish passport holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> I also note the Minister stated the Department is spending a lot more on security at some embassies. Is that due to intelligence reports that our embassies or staff may be under threat abroad from ISIS or whoever? The Minister might elaborate, if he can, on the embassies where security has been beefed up and for what reason, and the additional cost to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">I agree with it. We must protect our civil servants at work abroad representing the country and if there is such a threat, it is important that they are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> Finally, the Minister stated there were 250 fatalities abroad among those who went on holidays. The Department is brilliant any time we contact it to give consular service. The staff are on the ball. It means a great deal to a family to get a telephone call from somebody in an embassy in a country where there has been a fatality. As a matter of interest, would the Minister know how many of those 250 did not have travel insurance and what assistance the Department provides to families in such circumstances? Annual travel insurance costs €60 or €70. Most members hold such insurance. It is crucially important. The word should go out from this committee to anybody who is going abroad to ensure he or she takes out travel insurance.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I am standing in for my colleague, Deputy Seán Barrett, who cannot be here this morning. I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their appointment and wish them well in the coming years. I also congratulate the Chairman.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> The issue in the back of everybody's minds is the UK referendum. I congratulate the various Ministers, Departments and opposition spokespersons who have given so much of their time to promoting what is a common cause in so far as the United Kingdom's potential exit is concerned in the sense that, as referred to by the Chairman, while it may be in a different jurisdiction, there is a serious common interest. We hope that it goes right from the point of view of both the United Kingdom and this country. To those who say that it is a separate issue, we all are Europeans whether we like it or not. By virtue of the fact that we live on the continent of Europe, we have a common interest. John Donne always comes to mind, when he famously wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_70">if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_71">is the less,</p>
          <p eId="para_72">and he finished off by saying,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_73">And therefore never send to know for whom</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_74">the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">We hope that the response is in the interests of Europe when the results are made known.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> I congratulate the embassy staff and mission staff overseas for their work and involvement in the promotion of Ireland Inc., the national cause, the commerce and the industry, and the link-up that is required being part and parcel of the selling of the Irish image at all times. I suggest that continue and be emphasised because the corporate brand is much broader than we used to recognise it as being. It goes a long, long way. It has many aspects, including the football, which we have watched over the past few days and, hopefully, will watch to an even greater extent in the next few days.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> I congratulate the Department for its work and foresight, and its many missions overseas, which we have visited in the past and seen at first hand. They do tremendous work and take on considerable tasks with very little resources, and manage to survive and make an impact that is above and beyond that of a player of our size in the international arena.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, and welcome them to the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> On the initiative by the Minister in regard to the travel app, as he will be aware, we all are still celebrating last night's international soccer success. I have had occasion to talk to some of the fans who are in France. Being a supporter of Sligo Rovers, I know there is quite a number of Sligo Rovers supporters still in France. I do not know when they are coming home but I hope they will be out there for another week or two anyhow.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">The incentive provided by the Minister is welcome. For people going abroad for this event in France, the travel app is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> In respect of passports, we have had numerous such cases. Travel agents must also have a role to play in this area. I congratulate the Passport Office, which has been very understanding and helpful on numerous occasions under extreme time pressures to accommodate people if at all possible. It is right and proper that we acknowledge the work being done in the Passport Office. The only issue about which I have a reservation is the timeframe. People are led to believe that the passport application, if posted through An Post, will be back within ten or 15 days. I have had numerous complaints concerning this where it takes 20 days or more. It is important that people be aware of that when, as previous speakers have said, they are about to travel and realise, at the last moment, that their passports are out of date. People think that because of the three-day quick turnaround, which is a wonderful facility, that they will be able to get passports. It is important that travel agents and the general public be aware the Passport Office is working flat out and certainly the 15-day turnaround is very difficult to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> Recently I have been dealing with a very tragic case in Sligo involving a young lady who died in Japan. The service provided both by the Minister and his staff in Dublin and the people in Japan has been recognised by the family. The family were impressed by the assistance they received. From the time the family arrived in Japan, they were looked after by the staff there. I put this on record because if it happens there it happens in many other parts of the world. The Minister mentioned that some embassies and consular areas have only one member of staff. I wish to express my appreciation and that of the family for the service provided. There have been many other cases in which I and others have been involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">I thank members for their contributions. Perhaps I can address the replies by way of groups because there has been an interest in the same topics, including the issue raised by the Chairman and Deputy Darragh O'Brien in regard to Northern Ireland. I wish to assure members that we are anxious to advance matters under the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and A Fresh Start. Deputy Darragh O'Brien is correct in saying there has not been the same number of meetings this years compared to last year. That was because of our general election and coincidentally a round of Assembly elections in Northern Ireland, a rather protracted Government formation period here, similarly a negotiation of the programme for Government in Northern Ireland. As a result, there have been fewer meetings. However, during the period in question I did have a number of high-level engagements in Northern Ireland with the Secretary of State and with the party leaders. I expect to have a date very soon for the North-South Ministerial Council meeting. A date had been fixed for around now but all the parties were not in a position to proceed as we would have liked.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">However, that is a priority issue and I expect to be in a position to report progress through the Office of the Taoiseach. Of course, the Chairman and the committee will be informed. Deputy Darragh O'Brien is correct. It is important to ensure that the various ministerial engagements on the work programmes that have already been agreed report progress in a way that, in the circumstances, is appropriate. In the programme for Government we have identified a number of specific areas which will be implemented in early course. We are also looking at areas such as third level education, sustainable transport, cross-Border greenways, e-health as well as the more traditional areas such as economic development and programmes across the north west in particular. </p>
          <p eId="para_87"> I acknowledge the kind words of Deputies in respect of the staff at the Passport Office who, we all accept, do a very good job in somewhat challenging circumstances. In the course of our duties, as public representatives, we all deal with emergency situations, all of which seek a form of priority. We are now at peak season with more than 60,000 applications currently in process. So far the number of incomplete applications is of the order of 32,000, which gives rise to queries. Deputy Noel Grealish is correct when he speaks of the need to ensure we have a programme of information. Deputies, public representatives and county councils can all have a role by having these issues addressed by way of information at our meetings. We have notices at Garda stations, some post offices and the like. It is important that we continue to remind people to make an application in advance. If people are travelling in three weeks or more the passport express service is the cheapest and most convenient application channel, the turnaround for which is 12 to 13 days. Obviously for people travelling more immediately they should go online. The importance of our expenditure programme is to enable converting to online. This should not be underestimated. We expect that will be completed by 2018. Already people can apply for an alert reminder. We would hope by the end of 2018, once the applications are online, that the facility will have been taken up by large numbers of people. It is important that people register for reminders. </p>
          <p eId="para_88"> In regard to the spike in applications at this time of year, a number of steps have been taken by the Passport Office, including the recruitment of more than 200 temporary staff and current staff working overtime. My advice, which I ask the Chairman and members to convey to their constituents, is to allow six weeks, 15 days is the target, for receipt of passports. Unfortunately there are times when this timeframe cannot be guaranteed. It is important to engage with An Post to ensure applicants get a realistic estimate of the timeframe. </p>
          <p eId="para_89"> There has been an increase in the number of applications from overseas, particularly first time applications from Britain and Northern Ireland. However, in terms of applications from overseas the impact on the passport service overall has been minimal as numbers are low. The total increase in first time applications from Great Britain for the months January to May, compared with last year, is 3%. The total number of first time applications this year is likely to be of the order of 4,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">That represents a very small percentage of the total number of applications for Irish passports each year, which is currently approximately 670,000. I will furnish precise details of the countries outside the State with the greatest number of passport holders and the greatest number of applications but I would be disappointed if they were not the UK and the US, in that order. I am happy to continue engagement with the committee on the matter of passport services. We are working towards a reformed passport system, which will result in a state-of-the-art service to our citizens and applicants.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> In respect of consular services, I acknowledge the kind words of Deputies about the very sensitive, dedicated and important work our consular teams undertake abroad, often in very difficult circumstances. We already said that there were 250 deaths last year. This is a very sensitive time for families and we are anxious at all times to ensure that these sensitivities are observed and that we offer an appropriate level of assistance. In respect of consular expenditure, it is appropriate and necessary for us to look at it in terms of the entire year rather than on a month by month basis but the committee can take it that the amount of money we have allocated towards that will undoubtedly be expended because we are now running at in excess of 2,500 cases per annum, which is unprecedented. We always ensure that expenditure is appropriate to the needs of those involved. </p>
          <p eId="para_92"> Deputy Grealish is right about the issue of insurance. Unfortunately, too many of our people are going abroad without an appropriate level of travel insurance. We can only advise people, which we do. A significant feature of our new travel app is a series of local advices tailored to meet the circumstances of the country. Those who have seen it will undoubtedly have been enthused by the level of information. I would advise those who have not seen it to take some time out and look at it. I again advise constituents to do so because there is a huge amount of information on that app with advice on insurance. It underlines what the Department is doing to ensure that we have a state-of-the-art, world-class service for our citizens travelling abroad. In respect of the Chairman's remarks about France and Irish fans currently travelling, we had a most innovative feature of our engagement in this regard with immediate and short-term pop-up facilities in Lille and Bordeaux. Similarly, our team will be on the ground in Lyon on Sunday.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> Deputy Grealish mentioned embassies and threats and Deputy Darragh O'Brien referred to expenditure on our embassies. We do not have, nor have we had, any specific threats but we share information and intelligence with other embassy networks and liaise closely by means of taking advice from local intelligence services and police forces. There have been instances where we felt it was appropriate to increase our security because we have a strict obligation to our staff, our citizens and people using our embassy and consular services but we have not received any specific threat to any specific embassy in any specific country. Notwithstanding that, we keep our building network under review for security and other issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> In respect of the mission review, we have 81 full-time embassies and missions abroad. We would like to increase that number in accordance with our priority programmes over a range of issues with particular reference to trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Over the past number of years, like all Departments, we had some pressures on our expenditure but during that time, we were in a position to open new embassies in Jakarta in Indonesia, Hong Kong and Austin in Texas. We are reviewing what we would regard as best practice in order to ensure we can maximise our footprint across the regions. I would be happy at another stage with more time to go into a greater level of detail on that. I would welcome any commentary, advice or observations that members might have in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_96"> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan made a point regarding the reconciliation fund in respect of Northern Ireland and across the island. I can assure her and other members that the fund is open to new organisations. We encourage new applications and are anxious to ensure that we have a significant level of direct engagement with groups. If the Deputy has contact with any particular groups, we would be happy to hear from her in that regard. Again, I ask people to visit the Department's website from time to time where we have full and detailed particulars of the criteria for qualification, the application forms, the deadlines and dates. Of course, we would welcome new groups and we have an appropriate level of criteria-based scrutiny and evaluation with a view to ensuring an appropriate level of checks and balances. </p>
          <p eId="para_97"> I am not sure if the Chairman will allow much debate on Maghaberry Prison in the context of the Estimates because I know we are pressed for time but I would be happy to engage bilaterally with Deputy O'Sullivan if she requires some information prior to the next parliamentary question series. </p>

          <p eId="para_98">Before we move on to programme B, I remind members that we are way beyond our time limit so all of us must be more succinct in our questioning and comments. Will the Minister give a brief outline regarding programme B?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlesFlanagan" eId="spk_24" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2016-06-23T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_99">Programme B covers the Department's contribution towards a more just world, the promotion and protection of human rights internationally and a more secure world based on a stable and secure rules-based international environment. Over 70% of current expenditure in this programme is made up of contributions to international organisations. My Department's commitments to international peace, security and human rights under Vote 28 is channelled through programme B which has a total allocation of €56.8 million. This compares to €57 million in 2014. In addition, we have a contribution under international co-operation of €480 million under Vote 27, which the Minister of State will address.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> Ireland's role and influence in the developing world is far greater than our size warrants. This is the result of many factors. My Department maintains strong partnerships with our bilateral partners in Africa. Other factors include regular policy dialogue and voluntary contributions to our UN partner organisations. We continue to work closely with the Irish NGO community in the implementation of our aid programme. We increasingly seek out strong engagement across Departments such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on agricultural development in Africa and the Department of Health on global health issues. The reputation of Ireland's development programme has consistently been one of high quality, as has been endorsed in the most recent peer review of the OECD development assistance committee. I am proud to emphasise the dedication of our embassy staff in very difficult environments, not least the commitment and skill shown by our team in Freetown last year in tackling the Ebola crisis. During that crisis, we worked closely with all partners on the ground and were seen to have led the field in terms of responding quickly and appropriately to what was an horrific international crisis. </p>
          <p eId="para_101"> Finally, I would like to reflect on the role played by Ireland in responding to the migration crisis. We are seeing more people than ever before fleeing from conflict and poverty across the Syria region and many parts of Africa. Through the Irish Aid programme, my Department continues to provide humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of people caught up in such a crisis as well as the communities in neighbouring countries that are hosting large numbers of refugees and displaced people. </p>
          <p eId="para_102"> On the matter of UN contributions, most of the expenditure under this programme relates to Ireland's mandatory contributions to national organisations of which we are a member, including the UN, in the case of which the significant out-turn relates to contributions in support of our peacekeeping operations. I had the opportunity last week to visit our troops in the Golan Heights. The committee might give appropriate attention to this mission in terms of its travel arrangements because, from my experience and I know from the members', the troops abroad always like to engage with Irish parliamentarians. Predicting payments for the programme, particularly regarding UN peacekeeping operations, can be difficult. Estimated costs are submitted in some cases 12 months in advance of when a payment might be finalised. New missions can arise in response to emerging crises. The uncertainty of the dollar-euro exchange rate has all the potential to impact on the final out-turn that will be due in any given year. I might mention in passing that Ireland is seeking election as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-22 term. We declared this candidacy in 2005 and will be basing our campaign on Ireland's foreign policy credentials and strong international standing within the United Nations on the matter of disarmament and non-proliferation. These issues will remain a priority for 2016, building on our active engagement and participation in the international disarmament and non-proliferation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> We continue to advance human rights priorities, building on our successful membership and solid record of achievements on the UN Human Rights Council, following our two-year term on the council, which ended last year. A key pillar of our international engagement under programme B is our input into shaping and formulating the European Union's common foreign policy on defence and security, most notably meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, in which I participated last week. During my visit to the Middle East I met the Israeli Prime Minister, the Palestinian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and the opposition leader in Israel. I also visited troops serving in the Golan Heights and met with senior UN officials. I would be happy to speak further on this issue, perhaps at a future meeting, because I believe that our UN peacekeeping missions and the high esteem in which the Irish contingent is held by our international colleagues are hugely important. We have taken on for many years positions not only regarding our experience, but also our leadership expertise. I would also like an opportunity at some future time with the committee to discuss the Middle East peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> Expenditure under this programme remains largely on target. The level of our final UN contribution, however, will not be known until later in the year.</p>

          <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2016-06-23T10:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_106">I will be brief. I will revert to the Minister another day on his visit to the Middle East and particularly the situation of Israel and Palestine. Specifically, though, we would all like to commend our troops who are on UN peacekeeping duties across the globe and we welcome the Minister's remarks in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> He mentioned the migrant and refugee crisis in his statement, about which I would like to ask him two questions. Some of this may be more relevant to the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, in which case we can leave it until his contribution. I wish to ask specifically about our response as a Government and within the EU to the refugee crisis. We had made a commitment of resettling 4,000 people, refugees from Syria, Iraq and the Middle East. It is hard to get a figure, but my understanding is that we have settled 12 people. I know this covers the Department of Justice too, so I am not laying this all at the Minister's door. The EU response has been well below par.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">I would like the Minister to comment on that with regard to his contact with the Department of Justice and Equality. Will we reach the target of 4,000 people, who need our help and assistance, and will we abide by our commitment? If so, how long will that take?</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> Finally, I would like the Minister to comment on the decision of Médecins sans Frontières not to accept any funding from European Governments or EU institutions due to the EU-Turkey deal. We have made a financial commitment of about €22.9 million that is linked directly to the EU-Turkey deal. Many people, including myself, feel that the arrangement with Turkey is not in the best interests of many of those refugees. Turkey already has 3 million refugees from the region within their borders, but we believe that the rights of refugees and those in need are being infringed by this deal and that some of the money that we are allocating to the EU fund is actually being used to strengthen borders. I would like a comment today that none of the €22.9 million that we have allocated to the EU fund is being used for enhanced border protection and security so that we are stopping people coming into Europe. The situation is that those within Europe and in Greece already are stuck in camps, with their families left in Turkey. This is not a situation by which we as a country should abide, and the Department of Foreign Affairs, DFA, Department of Justice and the Government should reconsider our role in the EU-Turkey deal. It is a bad deal for those who need our help.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelGrealishPD" eId="spk_27">
          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2016-06-23T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_110">I will be very brief as I am conscious of the time. The Minister is aware that I visited the Middle East in a private capacity last year. I visited the refugee camps in north Lebanon, in which there were mostly Christian Syrians who were forcefully driven out of their homes by ISIS. ISIS came into their town overnight and a cross was painted on the door just because they were Catholic. They were given three options: convert to Islam, learn the Koran or be shot. I met one family in which the son-in-law refused to comply, and ISIS assassinated him there and then in front of the family. These people were thrown out of their houses there and then with just the clothes on their backs and told to leave. They are now in refugee camps in north Lebanon. They do not want to come to Ireland. They do not want to leave their home town. They want to go back home to their countries and live where they were born and reared. These are middle-class families who worked exceptionally hard and, just because of what has happened overnight, they are now in a refugee camp in Lebanon.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> In the course of that same trip, I attended a conference in Beirut at which we were told that, despite the birth of Christianity in the Middle East, if this trend continues, there will be no Christian left in the Middle East. Where in Iraq there were 2.2 million Christians, now there are fewer than 200,000. It is the same in Syria. Is enough being done at EU level to protect these people in the Middle East? What is being done by the EU about ISIS? ISIS must be stopped. What I saw in Lebanon is horrendous: hundreds of people crammed into little rooms just because they were Christian, just because they practise a particular religion. I know this happens to people of other religions, but the EU must get together with the Americans and Russians or whoever in the Middle East. Everybody must work together to stop the spread of ISIS. We see what ISIS is doing and the threat they represent around the world. Global co-operation is needed and the EU should lead it. I would like to hear what is being done at EU level in this regard.</p>

I generally share the remarks made already, but there is also a very urgent need for the United Nations to review its role and its influence globally. There is a gradual sidelining, for whatever reason, of the UN in the area of international conflicts, with obvious consequences.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">With regard to the Chairman's opening question on the matter of the interdepartmental committee on human rights, which was established in 2015 with the objective of improving the coherence of the promotion and protection of human rights, I believe work is ongoing. A number of meetings have taken place. I do not have up-to-date information since the recent Government formation but I would be happy to forward this to the Chairman and to record his anxiety that this committee complete its work programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> Reference was made to the matter of stability fund support, which has a budget of €4.4 million for 2016. It funds a range of organisations, including United Nations bodies, NGOs and those which engage primarily in the promotion of human rights and the rule of law in international peace building through a range of activities. I would happy to keep this committee informed of that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Noel Grealish raised the issue of migration and I am conscious of the Chairman's comments that we will not have a detailed discussion on the matter today. While acknowledging that it is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality and for the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, with regard to Ireland's domestic mandate, I would be happy to engage at some future date. This matter has been on the top of the EU agenda for more than a year. A number of initiatives have been developed to address it, including a comprehensive package of relocation and resettlement, in the course of which the Government has approved taking up to 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers. Progress on the resettlement has been good. We have already taken in 273 people - more than half of the number pledged - and we are on course to meet the target of 520 refugees by the end of 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> With regard to relocation, the progress has not been as we would have liked. It has been slow but it has been slow for everybody across the EU for a variety of reasons, many of which are not under our direct control, including operational difficulties and administrative issues. We have already received our first family of ten and we have pledged for a further 30 which we hoped will be filled very shortly. However, this is an issue which primarily falls to the Minister of Justice for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I am in direct contact with her.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> I will now turn to the situation in Turkey. I have noted the concerns raised by Deputy O'Brien. It is important that the agreement between the EU and Turkey adheres fully to international human rights laws and practices. This has been acknowledged by the European Union and was a part of the discussions. It is, and continues to be, a matter of concern to us but we continue to keep it firmly on the agenda. The measures agreed to in the EU deal with Turkey comply with international law with particular reference to the protection of human rights. Migrants will be protected in accordance with the relevant and appropriate international standards. I note the comments made by Deputy O'Brien in respect of the use of the expenditure by the Turkish authorities. We are at all times anxious that these moneys are expended towards the provision of shelter and safety to the many migrants putting extreme pressure on the authorities in Turkey. That is an ongoing process and I would be happy to keep the committee and the House fully informed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2016-06-23T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_126">The Department's work under programme C has been supporting Ireland's economic recovery through effective contribution to job creation, exports, inward investment, education and tourism and building and maintaining strong bilateral relations to promote economic interests abroad. My Department's commitment to advancing Ireland's trade and economic interests in Europe and internationally is set out under the programme. The amount allocated for this programme in 2016 is €27.6 million, which represents a very slight decrease on the 2015 provision of €27.9 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> With a global footprint of 80 missions, the embassy network has been fundamental to our efforts to restore Ireland's unique international reputation and to drive economic recovery through the promotion of trade, tourism and investment. Working in partnership with state agencies, embassies have made a significant contribution to Ireland's strong economic performance and our ongoing ability to continue to attract foreign direct investment and inward tourism. The new economic diplomacy strategy which launched in January aims to build the capacity of the network to enable our embassies to become more active and to open business hubs for our exporters, which complements the work of the State agencies. The first step is a pilot programme for the local hire of commercial <i>attachés</i> which is currently being rolled out at five embassies in the emerging markets where Ireland has recently opened missions. Trade promotion funds will be expanded and developed under this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> With regard to the St. Patrick's Day period and the export trade council, this year the council has already formally met on two occasions in January and June. The latter meeting had a particular focus on the UK referendum. Between the January and June meetings, there were also separate informal meetings with the private sector and with Government and State agencies. All 27 priority markets have prepared local market plans for this year and the seven designated exploratory and high-potential markets have also submitted plans for their activities this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> The OECD programme involves a contribution to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which was €2.2 million in 2015. This is a mandatory contribution and is expected to rise to about €2.5 million for 2016. With regard to the financial position at the end of May, our expenditure remains broadly on target.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">Perhaps the Minister could outline if there are any other high-profile trade visits planned for the remainder of 2016? It is more than five years since certain trade functions were transferred to his Department with the establishment of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Will the Minister indicate whether his Department ensures that its work and goals are aligned with those of other Departments and statutory agencies which are also working to enhance Ireland's trade and business abroad? I am thinking of the work of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland and Bord Bia in this regard. Is the Minister satisfied that there is no duplication or overlapping of effort?</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> At times we do not give due credit to many of the companies which are operating in the international markets, building up markets for themselves and growing markets. Before the trade functions were formally assigned to the Department, I know that it, through its embassy network, and the different statutory agencies always did great work in assisting Irish companies to build up relationships and expand into or develop new markets. We should be cognisant of the great work of so many small companies and large Irish companies out there gaining extra market share for Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">I also wonder about possible trade missions ahead. From being involved with this committee and with the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, I understand that countries are very keen to do business with Ireland. It comes from our attitude to aid and to human rights. Perhaps the Minister could indicate if Cuba is on his agenda because I understand that country would be anxious to have a trade mission. It is something that has been spoken of for quite some time and we do not see anything forthcoming on that particular matter. I want to stress, and I have attended quite a number of meetings about the matter, that if we are talking business we have to talk about decent work and our businesses, when they go to the countries, are encouraged to keep that on their agenda also.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">The Chairman has raised a very important point about co-operation between the various Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Of importance in that regard is the export trade council within my Department, which I chair, which comprises representatives at ministerial level from the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and representatives from State agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland. The export trade council acts as a link between the agencies and various Departments. </p>
          <p eId="para_135"> The trade, tourism and investment strategy expired at the end of last year. We are currently in the course of renewing that strategy, which will ensure all of our trade-related policies are current and fit into a whole-of-government approach. There is no doubt but that since the reconfiguration of Departments in 2011 the trade promotion section of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been working particularly well. The new mandate given to our 80 missions to place particular emphasis on trade, business and commerce has had dividends and, I might add, has played an important role in our economic recovery. There has been no formal agreement yet on the programme for trade missions for this year but I understand from Enterprise Ireland that it is in the course of finalisation. Enterprise Ireland will communicate the proposed programme to my Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Once agreed, we would be anxious, particularly now that we have almost reached the halfway point of the year, to ensure that not only do the missions take place but that they are successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> I referred earlier to St. Patrick's Day. The NBC network and my Department play a huge role in ensuring the success of the St. Patrick's Day events. This process was somewhat restricted this year because of the electoral cycle here. Notwithstanding this, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and several Ministers and Ministers of State visited six countries promoting Ireland and Irish business. We will be in a position, as always, to provide a full and detailed report in respect of the success in that regard. I take this opportunity to advise the committee that at the end of August, at my invitation, all of the heads of missions will be returning to Dublin to discuss their trade work. It is important, as we continue through the recovery of our economy not only in Dublin but also across the regions, that we ensure that all our missions are fully engaged in developing Irish trade, business and commerce. I would welcome any views the committee might have in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> With regard to question from Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, last year I had the opportunity to meet the Minister of Trade for Cuba at the UN. There are countries with which Ireland has not had the type of relationship that perhaps some of our citizens would have enjoyed. I will continue to expand and develop our network and contacts during the course of my tenure.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">This programme provides the framework for the Department's role in securing Ireland's influence in EU outcomes through maintaining and growing strong relationships with the European Union institutions and other member states. The programme equally supports Ireland's contribution to the EU's global engagement on peace and security, trade and development, as well as security in the wider European region.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> The allocation for this programme in 2016 is €19.3 million, compared to €19.5 million in 2015. The allocation supports the operation of our network of missions to Europe, including our 28 embassies in EU member states and the permanent representation in Brussels, allowing us to grow our influence. Our mission network operates on behalf of the whole of Government, promoting and securing our interests with our most important partners in Europe. This allocation is also used to fund projects which seek to further Ireland's foreign policy priorities under the EU common foreign and security policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The 2016 allocation is €418,000. Expenditure is divided into two categories, monetary payments under the Common, Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, and support for voluntary contributions to projects promoting Ireland's foreign policy priorities under the Common, Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, framework, as outlined in our foreign policy document, The Global Island: Ireland's Foreign Policy in a Changing World.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> In terms of outputs, by end June this year there will have been 32 incoming-outgoing visits by Ministers and senior officials to our European partners, keeping us on track to reach 50 visits by the end of this year. This includes 15 visits to western Europe, seven to eastern Europe and four to the Caucasus, Moldova and Central Asia. The outputs identified under this programme reflect the work of the Department in building our presence within the European Union and ensuring a strong flow of analysis and strategic information from our mission network to the appropriate and relevant areas of government. </p>
          <p eId="para_143"> The programme remains broadly on target but we are incurring additional security costs at some of our missions following the terrorists attacks in major European cities, as referred to earlier by Deputy Grealish.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">Reference was made earlier to the British referendum today. Has the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade made preparations in case of a British decision to leave the European Union, which I sincerely hope will not arise?</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> Do we have an embassy in each EU member state? If so, I presume we will continue to retain them. Also, over the years we have been very fortunate as a country in that we have had Irish people in senior positions in the European Union institutions. A few years ago concern was expressed that the number of Irish people in the institutions was declining. At one stage, it was thought a programme might be put in place to encourage people to apply for employment within the European Union institutions or to apply for transfer there from within the public service. Has there been any increase in the number of Irish people taking up employment in the institutions? </p>

          <p eId="para_146">Are there any appointments to EU bodies remaining to be made that are within the gift of the Irish Government? If so, how many and to what bodies? I refer in this regard to senior level appointments to agencies such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Court of Auditors and so on. Have all of those vacancies been filled?</p>

          <p eId="para_147">In regard to the Chairman's question regarding the UK referendum, contingency plans, co-ordinated under the Department of the Taoiseach, are in place across a range of Departments, including the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Foreign Affairs and Trade and so on. We will be eagerly awaiting the result tomorrow. I expect the Taoiseach will make a statement some time tomorrow morning outlining Ireland's reaction to the result and the appropriate next steps.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> On our missions in EU member states, we do have a full time presence in each of the 27 EU member states. As I said earlier, these are under review. I would be anxious that we would be in a position to open new missions abroad having regard to the changing circumstances. However, such endeavours must be maintained within budget. The allocation of resources is kept under review at all times. </p>
          <p eId="para_149"> On employment within the EU institutions, Ireland has always been particularly proud of its contribution at all levels across the EU institutions. It is testament to our endeavour and our expertise that over the years many senior positions within the EU institutions have been occupied by Irish personnel. I do not have information for Deputy O'Brien in regard to vacancies. I do not envisage that there are any vacancies but I am happy to communicate with the Deputy on the matter at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Members will have noted a recent initiative by the EU institutions to advertise for Irish language translators, and that will be of interest to Irish scholars and those wishing to work in the EU institutions. Those applications are under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Programme E is a new programme for 2016. It highlights the emphasis we are placing on driving and supporting public service reform and Civil Service renewal by strengthening our corporate governance and reviewing and upgrading key corporate processes and procedures. It includes the resources we dedicate to communicating globally through traditional and social media, providing high-quality advice, briefing and analysis to the Government, the Houses of the Oireachtas and other State actors, and our efforts to proactively publish information and to respond to freedom of information requests. The allocation under the programme for this year is €41 million, compared with €41.6 million in 2015. A total of 98% of the costs associated with this programme include the pay and non-pay administrative expenditure for the main support divisions of the Department, including those supporting our operations in ten locations on the island of Ireland and our 80 missions abroad. These include our information and communications technology unit, finance division, human resources unit, communications unit, policy planning unit and strategy and performance unit. The figure also includes the resources across the mission network dedicated to strengthening our international influence. Work has continued on the roll-out of new websites across our mission network in the period to 16 June 2016. There have been 4.3 million visits to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website network by almost 2 million unique users, compared to 2.7 million visits by 1.35 million unique users over the same period in 2015. Visits to the website have almost doubled year on year. We are on track to exceed our targets for visitors and unique users this year. The largest items of web and digital expenditure have included technical development costs for the TravelWise app, to which we referred earlier, and other non-recurring mission website-related costs. Press and public outreach expenditure has so far focused on the 1916 centenary events, including inward media visits and the May visit to Ireland by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> Some of the 2016 output targets provide a snapshot of headline governance activities in the Department as well as reflecting some of the key operational supports which enable the Department to perform across the programme. Earlier this year we published our first corporate governance framework for the Department, which sets out the structures and processes in place to help us deliver on our priorities, achieve our objectives and act in the public interest in ways that are consistent with legal regulatory and government policy obligations. The Department received the results of the first Civil Service employee engagement survey in April of this year. Our results were broadly positive in comparison with other Departments, exceeding the Civil Service average scores for 20 of the 24 measures examined. Since the survey results were issued, several workshops have been held with staff to identify practical initiatives to address some of the issues raised in the surveys.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> Eight knowledge management projects are advancing through our knowledge management and innovation task force, including new projects in areas such as contacts management and facilitating online payments. To date, 69 of the 80 missions have a social media presence - that is, 85% - and our aim is to achieve our target of 100% by the end of 2016. The Department’s policy planning unit is on target for its output and has completed four significant policy projects to date this year - on Russia, migration, the United Nations and US foreign policy. </p>
          <p eId="para_154"> In conclusion, the financial position at the end of May remains broadly on target. Customer service is at the heart of our work. The Department is updating the customer services charter and our customer service action plan.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">Is the Department recruiting any staff, or will it this year or in 2017? Has the Department lost significant international expertise and corporate knowledge through retirements?</p>

          <p eId="para_156">Notwithstanding the ongoing rota of retirements it has been the policy of the Department over many years to ensure that we have a programme in place to minimise any loss of expertise. We ensure we have people in place with the appropriate level of expertise to meet the needs required in important roles. Through our recruitment and promotion competitions, organised by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, we have recruited 13 permanent third secretaries since January. The next generation of appointments will ensure we fill the critical gaps here in Dublin and abroad.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">We are undertaking a review because it is important to avail of all opportunities and we are emphasising our trade mandate. Over the past couple of years we managed in very challenging financial circumstances to open 14 new missions abroad. I expect that over the next couple of years we may be in a position to increase our complement. The review is considering Europe and further.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Deputy O’Sullivan will be pleased to hear that we are considering particularly Latin America where there is opportunity for us, and South-East Asia, which has been particularly important for our trade policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">Where do the freedom of information requests to the Department normally come from? Do they come from the general public, concerned citizens, from the media or politicians? I believe that the parliamentary question is the ultimate way to obtain information from any Department. What kind of information would not be available through that medium?</p>

          <p eId="para_162">The total number of staff in the Department is 1,580. That includes 314 locally recruited staff in missions abroad as well as over 150 temporary clerical officers to meet the seasonal demand in the Passport Office. Deputy McLoughlin has raised an important point and it is one we keep under review. We recently reviewed the operation of our single diplomat missions which have worked well but there are recommendations and we hope to ensure that they have sufficient support from our headquarters here to help them prioritise their business engagements. We do not have any plans to expand that model but we will keep the situation under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Deputy Durkan will not be surprised to know that most of the freedom of information requests are from the media and members of the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">I turn to income accruing under appropriations-in-aid. The primary source of income which accrues directly to the Exchequer from my Department comes from passport application fees, which are estimated to amount to more than €40 million in 2016 and which account for more than 90% of all our appropriations-in-aid receipts. The total income under appropriations-in-aid is estimated at more than €45.2 million. Appropriations-in-aid to the end of May are ahead of budget by €5 million due to the increase in passport applications that we referred to earlier.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">I dtús báire, gabhaim mo chomhghairdeas leis an gCathaoirleach faoina cheapachán úr agus guím ádh mór air amach anseo agus ar bhaill an choiste fosta. Guím gach rath orthu go léir leis an obair thábhachtach atá romhainn. Chomh maith leis sin, ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt d'iar-oifigigh mo chuidse i Roinn na Gaeltachta. In 2014 nuair a tháinig an crú ar an tairne bhí siadsan ann agus is mór an tacaíocht agus an cuidiú a bhfuair mé uathu ag an am.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> The Chairman is conscious of the fact, as am I, that Ministers come and go, so I wanted to publicly acknowledge my appreciation to my former team in the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and to let this committee know that use of the Irish language will continue in this Department. I have a meeting today with the coiste Gaeilge in the Department. If the Chairman has any<i>
						</i>ideas around how we can network and link in with our global diaspora or global networks in respect of the promotion of the Irish language, we will be all ears. I further add that since coming into this Department, I have been welcomed in a very positive way and am really looking forward to working with a positive and strong team.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> I welcome the opportunity to present the 2016 Revised Estimate for Vote 27 - International Co-operation and to briefly outline our plans for the coming year. As the new Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development, I look forward to a constructive engagement today and throughout my term as Minister with responsibility for Ireland's development programme. I repeat that my officials and I are available to the committee at all times and I hope it will have an early opportunity to visit the aid programme to see and assess its impact for itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> As the committee is aware, Vote 27 - International Co-operation funds approximately 80% of Ireland's official development assistance programme, better known to the public as Irish Aid. The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department's high-level goal to work towards a fairer, more just, securer and sustainable world. For 2016, the Government has provided a total budget of €641 million, which is an increase of €40 million or almost 7% on the 2015 allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">This is the first substantive increase in the aid budget in seven years and is a clear indication of the Government's firm commitment to the aid programme. Of this total, €483 million is managed by my Department under Vote 27 - International Co-operation, while the remaining €155 million is made up of contributions by other Departments and Ireland’s share of the EU Development Co-operation budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> The Government is committed to the UN target of providing 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, as official development assistance, ODA. Our programme for Government reiterates this position and states that we will make progress towards the target as resources permit. As the economic recovery consolidates, we have begun to start delivering on this commitment. Our ambition is to continue to make sustainable progress towards the UN target in line with the commitment we have made with our fellow EU member states to collectively reach the UN 0.7% target by 2030, the timeframe for the sustainable development goals. At this stage, we estimate the 2016 allocation will deliver an ODA-GNP percentage of 0.36%. However, the final statistic, which is heavily dependent on GNP, will not be available until next spring.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Ireland’s aid programme is strongly focused on the fight against poverty and hunger in the world. More than 80% of our funding is provided in sub-Saharan Africa, where the needs are greatest. Seven of our eight key partner countries are in Africa, the eighth being Vietnam. We are working this year to address the immediate needs arising from the unprecedented level of humanitarian crisis in the Middle East and Africa, while strengthening the resilience of our partners through our long-term development programme. This is a difficult balance, given the scale of immediate need, but it is a vital one if we are to assist in averting future crises as a result of conflict, underdevelopment, inequality and climate change. It is essential that we frame our work in the context of the new sustainable development goals, adopted by world leaders at the UN last September, which provide a new agenda for global development up to 2030.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> The scale of the humanitarian crisis facing the world was captured by the UNHCR this week. There are now 65.3 million people worldwide displaced from their homes as refugees, internally displaced persons and asylum seekers. The number, scale and intensity of emergencies continue to increase and the humanitarian system is struggling to cope. In the past decade, the number of people who need humanitarian assistance has increased by 237%. Since 2004, humanitarian funding requirements have increased by 490%.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> Ireland's humanitarian assistance in 2016 will total approximately €150 million, representing a sizable scaling up on previous years. Our support is focused on responding to meeting the acute needs of people affected by ongoing complex conflict crises in Syria and its neighbouring countries, South Sudan and the Horn of Africa and the Sahel region. Ireland is also responding to food insecurity and acute malnutrition arising from the impact of the El Niño weather effect throughout Africa and to crises which receive less media attention such as those in Somalia, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Last month, I represented the Government at the first ever world humanitarian summit in Istanbul. At that summit, Ireland made a number of specific commitments which we are now taking forward. These include an increased focus on the needs of displaced communities, more efficient and predictable provision of humanitarian funding and greater coherence between our development and humanitarian funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Over the coming weeks, I plan to visit Uganda to launch our new five year development programme, which is strongly focused on education and some of the poorest communities in the country. I look forward to meeting with our NGO partners, which are so critical to the delivery of Ireland’s development and humanitarian programmes and to our policy engagement internationally. I will also be engaging with our key UN partners as we follow up on my initial meetings at the summit in Istanbul and prepare for the migration summit in New York on 19 September. We provide targeted core support to a number of key UN partners and other international organisations, whose priorities and policies fit well with ours and who have a proven track record of delivery. These voluntary contributions allow Ireland to participate in development co-operation at a global level in key areas of need and in countries outside our bilateral programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Our development co-operation is at the heart of Ireland’s foreign policy. Our key objective for 2016 is to continue delivering a world class programme which is aimed at some of the world’s most vulnerable and marginalised people, helping to save lives and building livelihoods.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">We appreciate the continued strong support and engagement of the committee in this regard. I would welcome comments and questions from members.</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2016-06-23T10:55:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_184">I thank the Minister of State for his introduction. We can take the individual Votes together because it is one programme. Pope Francis recently said that arms can get to places in very deprived countries where food cannot. That comment shows the failure of the international community to get aid, food and nutrition to many displaced people living in the most horrific circumstances. The barbarity, murder and genocide committed against people in Syria and that region has to be a source of great concern to all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> An issue I would like to see pursued is the horror being inflicted on many people in the Middle East being termed as genocide. A recent UN report made some commitment to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court. It is an issue Ireland should support and we should enlist the support of other EU member states. I do not think there is much benefit in having the slaughter and mass murder of innocent people and the horrors inflicted on many people in the region termed as genocide in 20 or 30 years' time. It should be done now. It is an issue we should pursue at EU and UN level.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> Will the Minister of State tell us what percentage of GNP was our ODA programme in 2015? Is Ireland considering working with any new key partner countries in addition to the nine established ones? A widely quoted figure this week was that 65 million people are displaced worldwide. It is a terrible reflection on the international community. Deputy Durkan referred to the non-working of the UN. We need its architecture to be reconfigured and for there to be a change in its work methods, in particular in regard to the veto of the Security Council. It crosses over with the work of the Minister of State, along with that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan. In every forum that is available to us, we should continue to raise these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> I take the opportunity to compliment the many people who deliver aid and assistance at the coalface and provide help to the most beleaguered people throughout the world. People are working with many NGOs, including lay people and religious missionaries. Many people volunteer to work in particular countries. They all deserve our commendation and appreciation because they are working in horrific circumstances. Over the years, the committee has had the opportunity to hear at first-hand the experience of different Irish NGOs, in collaboration with their international sister organisations. We want to send the message out that this State will continue to support as strongly as possible the work of those people in the provision of the humanitarian assistance that is so badly needed in many different parts of the world. Unfortunately, the demand seems to be growing all the time and aid is not getting to the most vulnerable people.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">I thank the Minister of State for outlining his programme of work and priorities. He referred to a figure of 0.36% of GNP as being our target. For a number of years, we have had a commitment to reach 0.7% of GDP. We discussed this issue in the Dáil. While the commitment is to be on target by 2030, it is incumbent on all parties and Independents that, in advance of the budget, we examine how, subject to certain growth assumptions, what the appropriate position should be in three or five years' time, should the term of the Government last between three and five years. We need to set that out on a multi-annual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The figure is linked to GNP and things work both ways. There can be substantial decreases in ODA in monetary terms, but matters can appear to be quite good in GNP terms. No one expected the crash. We will not go over all of that again, but it had an impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> I am aware of the work Irish Aid is doing with regard to auditing and review, which is taken extremely seriously and done very well. I do not have any specific concerns in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I want to return to an issue I raised with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan. I have specific concerns about the EU-Turkey arrangement. I understand that, through Irish Aid, our contribution towards the arrangement is €22.9 million. I agree with MSF that these moneys are supporting an ever more restrictive migration and asylum system in the EU. I would like to get confirmation that none of the moneys allocated are being used to strengthen border defences or for security within Turkey.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> The Minister of State has an excellent opportunity - on his visit to New York - to address the migrant crisis and to reassert Ireland's foreign policy independence. I am not happy - others will make up their own minds - about how the EU is addressing the crisis in the Middle East, Syria and Iraq. Most reasonable people will not be comfortable with the deal the EU has struck with Turkey. We should say that and there should be no fear about an independent Irish State asserting independent Irish foreign policy. I would welcome a more detailed discussion with the Minister of State and a meeting of the committee before the migrant summit in New York because it is a fantastic opportunity to strike out and say what is really happening. Europe has not reacted well to the crisis. Citizens need help and assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Deputy Grealish said many migrants do not want to come here. I understand that, but many do wish to do so and there can be a short-term solution. The response of the EU has, in many instances, been nothing short of disgraceful. To strike a deal with Turkey, given its human rights record, in particular its treatment of the Kurds on its southern borders, leaves a lot to be desired. We have to reassess the agreement. That is all I will say on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> On ODA, all of us have to plan as to how we will increase funding over the next three years for the excellent work that is being done through the Department of the Minister of State and Irish Aid. Once the committee is up and running, we would welcome the opportunity - outside the Estimates process - to have a specific discussion on that matter. We would like to see some of the programmes and the work that is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> I refer to our commitment in respect of the rebuilding and reconstruction of Gaza after the Israeli bombardment there and the war that took place. I understand we committed €4.5 million towards the reconstruction. What is the current position? Have we met that commitment?</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2016-06-23T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_196">I want to acknowledge what has been maintained in spite of recessionary budgets and repeated calls to drastically cut ODA or eliminate it altogether. I would like to see how we will achieve the 0.7% target because it is being pushed further and further out.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> We know the damage done by climate change, yet we are only donating €2 million to the green fund. Are there plans to increase that figure?</p>
          <p eId="para_198">I was a member of the previous committee and chaired the Irish section of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA. I have particular concerns about Africa. There was great disappointment when our embassy in Lesotho closed. I met the former ambassador recently, who is now working in a voluntary capacity. What engagement has taken place with Lesotho and the programmes we had in place?</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> I refer to a bigger issue, namely, policy coherence and aid effectiveness, about which I spoke recently at the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, Assembly. There are times when we seem to give aid with one hand but surely the objective must be to increase sustainable livelihoods and food security in African or partner countries. There are serious concerns that the economic partnership agreements, EPAs, trade agreements, etc., are not contributing to this objective. At the ACP Assembly recently - I mentioned this in the Dáil the other day - I was horrified to meet parliamentarians from African countries who knew nothing about EPAs even though their parliaments were going to ratify them. It is incumbent on Europe to make sure that parliaments know exactly what is involved in these EPAs. Other parliamentarians knew exactly what was involved in EPAs and had serious concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> An EPA agreement was signed in Botswana two weeks ago but its ratification is only coming up. There are countries which are prepared to ratify the EPA but because their neighbouring countries are not going to do so, they could be fined. I think there is an issue there for them and Ghana, in particular, could have an issue. Those countries are concerned that their own agrifood industries are being undermined. I do not think enough is going into that. Again, it comes back to policy coherence of giving with one hand and yet the economic growth of the donor country seems to drive so much aid. I know our aid is untied, which I hope continues, but other countries have serious concerns because that is what drives their overseas development aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Another issue is engagement with parliamentarians. I hope that whenever people go to Africa to visit areas in receipt of Irish Aid, they meet the local parliamentarians. Again, it is concerning that there are African parliamentarians who do not know about aid being given to their countries. We are talking about democracy and peer to peer engagement of parliamentarians. It is very disturbing that we do not see either.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> Another big issue, on which I would like us to do more, is tax. I read that Africa received $134 billion one year in the form of ODA and so on but in the same year, $190 billion left Africa in the form of tax evasion, tax avoidance and the various contracts multinational companies engineer and produce. There is a need to join up the dots. I totally support ODA and would never undermine or criticise such aid. We need to look at the bigger picture of tax, parliamentary engagement and policy coherence. We are lauded for sending all this milk formula, which is full of fat, to African countries but we have other programmes which encourage African women to breast-feed. There is a big industry around exporting frozen chicken parts and to certain African countries. They are banned in some countries but there is an illicit trade going on. This is an agrifood business which we could help to support local African farmers to develop.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is an important Department. It is also important we ring-fence and increase this money for overseas development aid. Sometimes members are asked why Ireland sends so much money abroad when we need some at home. A number of years ago, I visited some of our projects in Africa. I met 12 members of parliament in Zambia, eight of whom had been taught by Irish missionaries. It is important we acknowledge that. We stayed in a town in the middle of Zambia, whose name I cannot think of. The town was pitch dark as there were no street lights. We were told not to leave our hotel but I wanted to sample the local beer.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Around the corner from my hotel, I found Delaney's Irish bar. When I walked into the bar, the whole place went silent. A guy asked me where was I from and I said I was a Member of Parliament from Ireland. The man said, "You Irish are very welcome because your missionaries have been very good to us." I ask the Minister of State to outline the co-operation, if any, that takes place between his Department and our missionaries abroad. The tremendous contribution made by Irish missionaries is a huge reason that St. Patrick's Day is celebrated abroad and it is something that should be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> We have heard much lately about some agencies and organisations in receipt of State funding being investigated because it is suspected that the money has not been spent correctly. What audit and innovation procedures are in place in the Department to ensure that the money goes where it is needed?</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Sadly, when I visited a school in Africa I found that there was only one biro to be shared among all the students.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">I was kicking myself that I did not bring a box of biros with me on my visit. One must acknowledge the tremendous work that agencies do abroad but it is crucially important that the money goes where it is needed. I want to know whether there are proper checks and balances in place.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_68">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2016-06-23T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_210">I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him well in his future role in the Department. It is an interesting Department and many challenges will emerge on a daily and weekly basis, including emergencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> I agree with the remarks made by previous speakers on the need to ensure aid reaches the people for whom it is intended. We must ensure that nobody along the way decides to cream off a piece, an edge or a corner of the funding for his or her own benefit. In fact it is required that this committee, and I am only a passing member today, takes control of this issue. In so far as is possible, the committee must visit the various locations, meet local politicians and be clear in its understanding of what must be done. The committee may well be criticised by the media for travelling abroad. The fact is that ODA is an important area of investment and, therefore, it is important that we ensure that the money is put to the right use.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Aid for trade has been referred to already by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan. We need to be very careful that we do not find ourselves indirectly aiding commercial enterprises in other countries. We give aid without strings attached but not every country does so. I strongly urge that a careful assessment be carried out on countries involved in aid for trade. We must find out whether we will become disadvantaged by their activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> Like Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I wish to mention the important issues of refugees and Turkey. It is true that Turkey has had an ongoing problem with human rights but that country's standards relating to and recognition of human rights are not the same as ours. There is a vast difference and that has always been the case. Unfortunately, throughout the European Union there has been an inexorable move away from Turkey and a tendency to wrongly blame it for things. Ireland used to be quite supportive of Turkey and encouraged it to comply with the <i>acquis communautaire</i> and to join the European Union. In recent years, Turkey has moved away from Europe and now has fewer friends in the so-called free world, which is not good. Recently, I watched a television programme in which a woman went into great detail to explain that the people like her, who are liberal minded and progressive, are becoming more isolated by virtue of the fact that Turkey appears to have been isolated by the free thinking global community. I have concerns about such a situation. Previously, Turkey had a natural tendency to move towards Europe and aspired to the same standards that we regard as being a normal part of a modern society. I think Europe is going in the opposite direction now.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">My point is about the extent to which we tend to see the European Union, and the United Nations as well, as having failed in terms of the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. The EU, as an entity, seems to be getting the blame but it was not the EU that caused the problems; it was the individual member states across the European Union and others across the globe. There was no compulsion on anybody to do anything other than respond in a favourable fashion to the crisis as it arose. It was not a great advertisement for freedom-loving global communities to see children falling off boats and their bodies being picked up on beaches or to see the old emblem of razor wire as the greeting for children, their mothers and other adults who were refugees and who walked more than 100 miles to get to a place of safety. As a global community we did not cover ourselves in glory and we stand convicted of negligence and failure to respond or do anything in a situation as catastrophic as the one that has prevailed in the past two and a half to three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> When I was a young person, I read about Nazism, the failure of various countries to recognise what was happening long before it came to pass and the appalling cruelty that was visited on the European community and, eventually, the global community. I am greatly worried about the consequences of the type of scenes we have seen on our television screens in the past two and a half to three years. If we, as a global community, try to divest ourselves of any responsibility for those events, we are wrong. We are deluding ourselves. Oscar Wilde said duty is what we expect of others but not necessarily of ourselves. That duty must fall to each and every person. In the near future, a recognition has to dawn that every freedom-loving person in Europe and across the globe has a responsibility to respond in some fashion. We are having a debate across Europe on what is called immigration, which is a nice word but that is all it is, but unless the European community and the global community come to grips with recognising that we have responsibilities and freedom, and that we can respond in a much more favourable fashion than we have done in the past, we will be condemned in the future and we may suffer the consequences of what happens when we neglect that area. I am sorry for going on about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">It is a very important issue. I stated earlier that the displacement of 65 million people is a huge indictment of the global community. Deputy Darragh O'Brien referred to the deficiencies in the EU-Turkey agreement. We all share that particular view. We do not give enough recognition to those small states, including Jordan and others, in the immediate vicinity of Syria which have taken in a huge number of refugees and which also face challenges. In fairness to Turkey, it has taken in approximately 3 million refugees from Syria, which is much more than the number taken in by wealthier European states. We would appreciate it if the Minister of State responded to some of the points raised that are relevant to his Vote.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe McHugh<recordedTime time="2016-06-23T11:15:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_217">It is encouraging that there is a good deal of experience here in that some members were on the previous foreign affairs committee and I can sense that there will be an ongoing engagement on these major challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> The Chairman quoted Pope Francis, who referred to food and emergency services not being met because the people needing them were living in war zones or for various other reasons. That is an issue, but I put a challenge to the Chairman and the members. We have to look at our own set-up in terms of the peace process. The Chairman was very involved in the Good Friday Agreement committee and perhaps we have story to share in terms of bringing communities together.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I met a priest recently, Fr. Padraig Devine, a Roscommon man based in Nairobi, who is very much focused on conflict resolution in war zones. He sees no point in building schools and hospitals if the conflict cannot be sorted out. He could be an interesting participant in this committee and the Chairman might get a chance to contact him at some stage. The organisation is Shalom. I had not heard of it until I met Fr. Devine a few weeks ago. He has something significant to contribute that might help the members in their engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> We have a role to play. We can enlist the support of the International Criminal Court where there are examples of genocide, rape and so on to ensure that aid gets to the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> The members will be aware that there is a conflict resolution unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and I met with the staff in the past two weeks. There is an opportunity for this committee also to engage with that unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> I was asked if we envisaged the designation of a new key partner country in the near future. We do not. We have eight key partners, seven of which are in sub-Saharan Africa where there is a strong strategic commitment to long-term assistance. I refer to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi and Sierra Leone. Outside that continent, there is also Vietnam. That is not to say there is no engagement on funding with other countries. Obviously, events bring change. El Niño brought devastating consequences to southern African and it is affecting food supplies. The cost of food in places like Lesotho is having a major impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Deputy O'Brien raised again the EU-Turkey refugee facility, which he raised with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, who said he would note that. It was agreed by the European Council to fund services for Syrian refugees in Turkey. The specific commitment given was that it was for services for Syrian refugees. I am aware of a committee that will work in tandem with the decision that has been made and if this committee has reservations, there might be an opportunity for it and our Government to let those be known because it was not specifically about border enhancement; it was about services for refugees.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> In terms of the funding, the Deputy is correct that it is €22 million over four years, including €5 million from Vote 27 in 2016. We engage, through our officials in Brussels, on the management of funding under the new Turkey refugee facility and no doubt the Deputy will continue to engage with this committee on that. We note his concerns, which he outlined clearly.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">We can have a timeframe built in until 2030 but we can examine the issue in a comprehensive way and if that means having a multi-annual budget in a two to three year or four year time period, that is a worthwhile suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> The very difficult times since 2011 must be noted. When I first heard the figure I had to ask if it was right. We invested €3.8 billion since 2011. That is a massive injection when we consider the need this year for the humanitarian interventions is for $20 billion just to deal with the crisis this year. That is a significant contribution. While taxpayers here were going through a very difficult time, they were still contributing to the global needs in terms of the humanitarian crisis. That has to be noted.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> I have a note on the reconstruction of Gaza.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">In response to the humanitarian situation, Ireland has provided €2.5 million to the emergency appeal of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. This support has helped to provide urgently needed food, shelter and medical aid to thousands of families. A further €500,000 was recently approved by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for the Gaza emergency appeal and will fulfil the pledge of €2.5 million made by Ireland at the international Gaza restructuring conference in October 2014. This will bring the total contribution to the 2014 Gaza crisis to €3 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> As a new Minister of State, I will be relying a lot on Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's experience of Africa. I have never been there but I am really looking forward to going in two weeks' time. I had a great opportunity at the Ireland-Africa forum to meet many people from the continent. As the Lesotho ambassador pointed out, the forum had the biggest representation from Africa in five years, so something good is happening in that partnership and it needs to continue. The Deputy also mentioned the green climate fund, for which €2 million has been provided through the Department of Finance. In the context of our commitment to overseas aid, we will work together on the question of the amount as a percentage of gross national income. The embassy in Lesotho was closed on 31 October 2014 following the reappraisal of Ireland's wider diplomatic network and the need to make the most effective use of limited resources, as the Deputy will know. I was in the constituency of Deputy Darragh O'Brien on Tuesday and saw a very interesting project at Portmarnock community school. The ambassador of Lesotho was there. People looking for a confidence-building exercise in addressing global problems will see it there as it is a very practical initiative. The council has been engaged and young people in the school are developing apps. They are looking at mapping a country that is a long way away from us. A lot of it is done remotely - they do not have to get on a plane but can do it using the ICT mechanisms we have. It is a very interesting project and is an example of the voluntary work and practical measures that are being taken outside our financial commitments. Teagasc is involved in partnership exercises relating to food. Africa can supply enough food to feed the world, not just Africa, and all of these measures can help. The Deputy also asked about untied aid, and we will remain committed to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Deputy Durkan stressed the importance of meeting local parliamentarians. Tax issues were raised, and there are many areas on which we need to work at a global level, such as in the UN and the EU institutions. There are, however, practical measures we can take. I saw some statistics recently about the provision of radiotherapy services, chemotherapy and smear testing, and these are areas on which we can work closely. I would be very happy to support any practical measures suggested by committee members.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> The ratification of EU economic partnership agreements, EPAs, was also mentioned. Since the conclusion in 2014 of three EPAs with west Africa, the east African community and the southern African development community, the EU and its member states have been working with 27 African countries to achieve ratification by 1 October. Ireland has played its part in this process, signing the west African EPA in December 2014, which was approved by the Dáil last November. The southern African development community EPA was signed on 10 June in Botswana, and EU member states signed the east African community EPA on 20 June. Discussions are ongoing on a date for the formal signature ceremony in east Africa.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The Department has to look at a regional approach to this and measures are in place in this respect. If Deputies need any further information on this we can certainly supply it.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Deputy McLoughlin asked about decreases in Vote 27 relating to consultancy services and certain administrative services. The major need is for a follow-up to humanitarian crises and the peace and stability fund is up by 27%, while the rapid response fund is up 100% and recovery assistance is up by €5.3 million. The big measures involve dealing with a situation at a given time, such as have arisen owing to 65 million people being displaced because of conflict in vulnerable countries, such as South Sudan and Yemen, and devastating climatic issues arising from El Niño in southern Africa which are outside our control. The Department has great capacity in the shape of its relationship with its partner aid organisations which, as members have said, have done tremendous work and we will continue that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> Deputy Grealish asked about missionaries. I did some research into a certain missionary who left Bangor and ended up in Bobbio in Italy in 516 AD, his name Columbanus, and his work can be seen in France and Austria. This is in our nature and is part of who we are. We like to give, to travel and to help people in need and the Deputy is absolutely correct about the doors this activity opens, something which is also evidenced by our nuns and priests who went abroad. It is important to point out that €15.5 million has gone to Misean Cara, an organisation which does great work in health intervention and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> I was also asked about auditing. We have an evaluation audit unit in the Department which is independent and reports to the Secretary General. It is important that it is independent and robust so that we ensure taxpayers' money is spent wisely. Deputy Durkan said it was important to see for oneself what the situation was in certain areas. He referenced Turkey and has concerns in this area. He made the point that time was not on our side and suggested that, while 2030 might seem a long way away, it is only 14 years. It was 14 years ago that I was elected to the Seanad but it feels like yesterday and 14 years fly by. Time is not on our side and we have serious problems. The agreed sustainable development goals, SDGs, were led by Ireland and co-facilitated by the Kenyan Government to implement the practical measures required. I asked Charles Boamah of the African Development Bank for his perspective on the 700 people from Syria who died in the Mediterranean. He told a story about a man he met who survived the crossing. He asked him why he had risked his life and the gentleman replied that he did not risk his life - he was already dead. I think everybody in this committee gets that. I think everybody in this country, from primary schools to secondary schools, gets it too.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">A school in Skibbereen, Kilcoe national school, came up with a great project which won the national competition. The project was called "There is No Planet B". Irish people get it both at home and abroad. There is a duty on all of us to address the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> I look forward to working with the committee. I will report back from my trip to Uganda. I hope the committee will stay in touch. The officials want to work with members also because they know the 14 years until 2030 is a small chunk of time in which to anticipate a population growth of up to 9 billion. I wish you well in your deliberations, Chairman. I know your heart is in the right place and that we can continue this engagement.</p>

Earlier, the committee agreed to invite both Ministers to attend a joint committee in the autumn to examine the proposed allocations to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for 2017. The meeting will be scheduled in advance of the 2017 budget allocations. The committee secretariat will correspond with the Department in that regard with a view to having documentation submitted to the joint committee before the end of July. The select committee is adjourned until 30 June at 10 a.m. when we will consider the Revised Estimates for defence with the Minister for Defence.</p>
