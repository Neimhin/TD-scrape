          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Dooley that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to review planning guidelines to incorporate traffic control measures in all new housing developments, and furthermore to establish a funding stream to local authorities to allow for the construction of traffic calming measures in established housing developments and built up areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to agree a compensation package for a group of former workers at Ballingarry Mines, Thurles, County Tipperary, due to their permanent and increasing incapacity, resulting from conditions while working in the mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide an up-date on the provision of a temporary teacher for St. Mary's national school, Drumlish, County Longford, a position which is urgently required to take account of the increased enrolment at this four teacher school.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_9">Recently the HSE informed me that there are 25 unfilled speech and therapist posts in hospitals and special schools throughout the old health board areas in the city and county of Dublin.  In fairness to the Government, it has allocated money for these positions but they simply cannot be filled.  This year alone, four universities will produce 100 excellent young professional graduates in speech and language therapy.  They will be trained to a high level of proficiency and are prepared to work in this country, but they cannot be employed directly because the Health Service Executive has stipulated they need three years of postgraduate training.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Will the Leader use her good office to contact the HSE to determine whether we can surmount this problem?  There are unfilled positions in Dublin and throughout the country, yet some of our bright young graduates will head off to England or France, which is crazy.  We need to create junior posts to allow them to engage in speech and language therapy to the benefit of Irish children and adults.  There has been a huge vacuum in the provision of the service in recent years.  Will the Leader contact the HSE directly on this matter to make progress thereon?  She might have more luck than I would have.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Will the Defence of Life and Property Bill 2006, in the names of Senators Morrissey, Brennan and Minihan, be backed by the Government tonight?  When a Private Members' Bill in the name of the Fine Gael Party was introduced to address this matter in the other House, the Government voted it down.  It has done a complete about turn on this issue.  The two Bills are not exactly the same but the U-turn is now virtually complete.  Is the Defence of Life and Property Bill 2006 a Government Bill?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_12">We debated at length in the House the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill and received all sorts of reassurances in respect thereof, especially concerning section 13 which deals with resources.  During the course of the discussion, I and others said there was a shortage of therapists of every kind, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  The subject was also discussed by at least two committees of the House and it was requested that the number of therapists be increased as it was feared there would not be enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">In the past month I have addressed meetings on the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act in three education centres around the country.  At each meeting it was suggested that the system would collapse for want of therapists and psychologists.  Senator Brian Hayes's point in this regard is correct.  If action is not taken now, the legislation will collapse.  The Act is a major cornerstone of Government policy on special educational needs and disability and was supported on all sides of the House.  The therapists must therefore be made available.  I recommend that the Leader read the report of the National Council for Special Education, published last month and available on the council's website.  It indicates the importance of the points Senator Brian Hayes made.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The headline in this morning's newspaper concerns the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  I declare an interest in this regard as I am its vice chairperson.  I reassure Members that the board is doing exactly what it was set up to do.  The headline claims that 40% of personal injuries cases are being referred to the courts.  The board was set up to deal with up to two thirds of such cases and there are always cases that necessarily proceed to court.  The lawyers have frightened everyone into believing no case will go court.  All that will ever happen is that the cases regarding which there is no dispute will be dealt with by the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">As I pointed out when the relevant legislation was passing through the House, there is no confrontation or hearing involved, rather it is a question of a paper trail.  For the process to work well, only two thirds of cases can be dealt with by the board.  Of all the settlements that have been made, two thirds have been accepted by those concerned and, therefore, the system is working exactly as it is meant to.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">A point was made in the paper this morning that the insurance companies are the big winners, in spite of the reduction in the price of premia and the lower legal costs.  This may well be the case — I choose my words wisely — but the Personal Injuries Assessment Board has no control over this.  It is a consumer and political issue and is being examined by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business.  It must be considered very closely and is important.  The committee has written to the insurance companies recently asking them to make specific information available to the board.  This will be the next step in addressing the issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_17">I want to raise two issues, the first of which concerns the headlines in the national newspapers today and yesterday on the abuse of a 14 year old boy.  As a parent, I am horrified by this.  It brings very clearly into focus the dangers of children playing around with the Internet and mobile phones.  The story demonstrates there are predators in society waiting for vulnerable young people such as the 14 year old boy.  The investigation is in its infancy but we should all be vigilant as parents to ensure our children are not exploring the Internet in the manner of the young boy in question which led him into the circumstances he now finds himself.  It must be a horrendous experience for him and his parents and I shudder at the thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I have come across a number of cases recently concerning the gross neglect of tenants by landlords in cases where those tenants are having difficulties with their neighbours.  On two occasions in recent months, tenants have approached me in Mullingar to complain about two different sets of next door neighbours.  In one case, the landlord asked the complainant, whose life was made a living hell, to speak to the chairman of the residents' association.  If ever there were ever a Pontius Pilate cop-out from one's responsibilities, that was it.  I would welcome a debate on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">There is a legislative void because landlords are not discharging their responsibilities concerning those living next to their rented properties.  While rented properties are important and provide a facility for individuals who might not be able to afford to purchase such a property, this is not the issue in question.  The real issue concerns tenants' behaviour towards their neighbours and landlords' duty to ensure their tenants discharge their responsibilities to their neighbours.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">Will the Leader arrange a debate on the manner in which appointments are made to semi-State boards and other agencies?  Most appointments are made on the basis of the appointee's party affiliation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_21">The Senator would know something about that himself.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_22">This is very evident in the approach of the current Government as people are not appointed according to their ability to do their jobs.  This needs to be addressed.  The 150 or so semi-State agencies are top heavy with appointees of both the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil.  The Progressive Democrats Party was to address this when it got into power but it is now as bad as its Government partner at appointing its own people to boards and agencies of one kind or another.  It is important to debate this as a matter of urgency because the boards could make it very difficult for the incoming Fine Gael and Labour Government to operate when it comes into power later this year.</p>

The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has complained that it has been unable to appoint sufficient staff to carry out its functions properly.  It strikes me that the issue involves a conflict between two perfectly laudable policies and I wonder whether the Minister for Finance could come here to discuss it.  I fully acknowledge the need to control Civil Service numbers and avoid superannuation and other liabilities in the future.  However, such a policy can deprive Departments and agencies of the staff they need to carry out their functions.  It has, for example, held up civilianization of the Garda and the introduction and staffing of the Office of the Garda Ombudsman.  We should try to find a reasonable way to solve this problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">I raise the matter in light of an excellent position paper released yesterday by the Roman Catholic bishops entitled Palestine-Israel, Principles for a Just Peace.  The spokesperson for the hierarchy stated on the radio this morning that he was not seeking any punitive action against Israel and did not want to be seen as anti-Israeli or anti-Semitic.  However, gross violations of human rights are taking place.  Yesterday, I received a telephone call in regard to the continuing illegal demolition of houses of elderly subsistence farmers in the villages around south Hebron.  It is intolerable that violence is being visited upon children and the elderly or that the most rudimentary sanitary facilities are being demolished in order to degrade the Palestinian people.  The issue also highlights a element of hypocrisy.  We claim to have standards but do not operate according to them.</p>

We have to be careful because it seems the newspapers may have already prejudiced a possible trial through the nature of their reports on the case.  However, the reports reveal that the boy concerned has been dignified and honest in his approach to the inquiry and in the way he answered questions.  He appears to have been surfing the Internet for some time in order to look for gay sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">This State has let down and abandoned young gay people.  There is no proper provision of education for them in terms of modules about sexuality, despite repeated requests.  Last year, for example, I highlighted a case involving the suicide of a decent young man.  We do not make proper provision because there is resistance to this kind of information.  We cannot criticise this regrettable situation unless we support young gay school-goers.  We do not do so at present and it is hypocritical for us to bellyache about the issue unless we support these vulnerable teenagers.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">They are not entitled to postal votes for a general election.  For example, a person from Carrickart who attends University College Cork is entitled to a postal vote, while someone from Buncrana who attends the University of Ulster at Magee College, which is ten minutes across the Border, is not so entitled.  This anomaly could be cleared up if it was brought to the Minister's attention.  The universities require instruction in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">As for the all-Ireland context, many anomalies and complexities will arise.  While Members refer to cross-Border issues, they should be referred to as complex Border issues from henceforth, because many challenges will be faced in areas such as telecommunications, all-Ireland energy markets and infrastructural project markets.  Members must consider the capacity to handle such issues.  Some reports have already been produced in this regard, including one I read this morning, which was an all-Ireland analysis on a cross-Border basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">However, one critical element was omitted, namely, the concept of capacity-building at a community level.  I refer to areas such as Newtowncunningham, which has been recorded as the fastest growing village in Europe.  The 2006 census has indicated that it is growing at an accelerated rate.  However, the critical point in respect of a Border village such as Newtowncunningham is that it has become a dormitory village of Derry city's urban sprawl.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">People from Derry city who move to places like Killea, St. Johnston, Carrigans and Newtowncunningham continue to send their children to crèches and primary schools in Derry.  They are entitled to so do under the EU regulations in respect of the free movement of people.  However, I will give one example of the consequences.  Last year, on examination of the census figures, a young woman decided on the basis that Newtowncunningham was the fastest growing village in Europe to establish a crèche there.  However, she was obliged to close it down last year because she could only attract two clients.  Serious issues exist along the Border.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_98">I support the calls by Senators Brian Hayes and O'Toole for an intervention in respect of speech, language and occupational therapists.  Senator Daly and I have raised this matter in the House previously in respect of the mid-west region and in particular, the inability of the local representatives of the Health Service Executive to employ therapists to deal with autism and other difficulties in the autism spectrum such as Asperger's syndrome.  In addition to the difficulties identified by Senator Brian Hayes regarding post-graduate requirements, they also exist in respect of pay scales.  The HSE is bound by pay scales, whereas third party contractors are not bound by the same regulations.  Ultimately, the HSE buys the services from such third party contractors and pays a great deal more than would be the case were it to take such people into its own employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">In conjunction with the points made by Senators Brian Hayes and O'Toole, Members must consider entry qualifications and could consider assistant posts.  More importantly, pay scales must also be examined because at present, it is far more attractive for students who graduate from the very good courses run by the University of Limerick to enter private practice.  Consequently they are not as interested in dealing with autism cases because of the complexities involved.  Moreover, it is also more attractive for such students to travel for a year or two to places such as New Zealand and Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Immediate intervention is needed.   While it has been recognised that the Government has put money in place, unfortunately the bureaucracy within the HSE does not appear to appreciate children's urgent needs.  Although a relatively good service is available for those aged zero to six, there is a major lack of facilities available to children aged between six and 18.  Urgent action is required and I appeal to the Leader, as have the other Members, to try to bring about some level of clarity on the part of the HSE.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_103">He has a key role to play, particularly in building up confidence in business in Ireland.  It would be highly serious, particularly for multinationals, for the wrong message to go out.  The wrong message would be that Ireland did not take corporate governance seriously and was in some way lax in its international obligations in this regard.  This issue could be debated usefully on an all-party basis.  There would not be any disputes in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">However, there will be disputes regarding the next subject I wish to raise.  I thank Senator Bannon for raising the subject of appointments to semi-State bodies.  I have a long memory and recall the former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, indulging himself in an orgy of appointments in these Houses just before leaving office in 1977, which caused much comment at the time.  Senator Bannon is welcome to sign the Independent Members' motions Nos. 8 and 9 of No. 21 in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">All Members know that semi-State appointments constitute spoils of war that are distributed by whoever is in Government.  This is an abuse and is carried out ruthlessly and not only by Fianna Fáil.  That party does more of it because it is in power more often.  However, Fine Gael in power also does it ruthlessly, by removing some highly able people from office and replacing them with political hacks.  It has been done in an even more extreme manner by the Labour Party, whose members disgraced themselves in 1992 when they came to power.  A mature debate could be held both on semi-State appointments and appointments to the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Every time I say there is a political input to appointments to the Judiciary, I am greeted by howls of protest, which is ridiculous because every Member knows that it is true.  The most intelligent comment on the Order of Business was Senator Minihan's heckle of Senator Bannon regarding prison visiting committees, which is not a great reflection on the rest of us.  He stated at least his party did not appoint people to the prison visiting committees in areas where the appointees were not living.  Such appointments are an unspoken luxury, given as a party political reward so that, for example, people from Donegal can be appointed to visit prisons in Dublin and people from Dublin can visit prisons in Donegal.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">FÁS plays a significant role in training and many people owe their careers to the opportunities provided by the organisation.  It also plays an important role in community development and the maintenance of community amenities.  However, the social needs of the participants on FÁS schemes are often overlooked.  When participants exceed the age threshold or have been on a scheme for a specified number of years, they must leave and they cannot return.  I was involved in an exercise in recent weeks to establish the profile of many of the participants.  More than 80% fell into the social needs category and the primary issue is not whether they have a job for life.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">When these people are forced to leave a FÁS scheme, they are unable to get a job and this was underlined strongly during a recent edition of the RTE <i>Nationwide</i> television programme.  A FÁS project based on a bog in rural Ireland was visited and the participants were interviewed.  One elderly participant was asked what it meant for him each day to leave his home and do this work.  He replied simply that it was like coming to paradise.  I understand fully what he means.  When that lifeline is cut off from him and many others like him in the midst of our great affluence, their quality of life will disappear and they will have to remain at home.  The capping issue can be corrected easily by approaching it on the basis of social needs of participants.  If that is not done, we will have lost our way in cherishing all the children of the nation equally.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">I support the call by Senators Brian Hayes and Dooley on the HSE to take action regarding vacancies for various therapists.  This is an issue in the mid-west as well in Dublin.  Under the previous health service regime, the Mid-Western Health Board established a course in conjunction with the University of Limerick to provide educational facilities so that people with disabilities in the region could qualify for assistance but the HSE in its wisdom differs on that.  Since the HSE took over, the position has worsened.  The precedent has been set and it would be worthwhile to pursue it.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">I support yesterday's call by Senators for a debate on the comments of the chairman of the Road Safety Authority.  He believes the Garda has lost the fight on drugs but I would like the debate extended to cover road safety.  In particular, I would like to ask the chairman why the speed limit on the finest stretch of motorway in the State between Naas and Dublin on the M7 is 100 kph.  Enforcement is like shooting fish in a barrel because the speed limit increases to 120 kph after Naas.</p>

The planning service provided by local authorities such as North Tipperary County Council is a disgrace.  The north Tipperary local authority needs at least five additional planners but the manager of the council has stated there is an embargo on the appointment of staff.  The citizens of north Tipperary must deal with a second class service.  The suggestion that planners are responsible for the closure of petrol stations is untrue.  Local authority members draft county development plans and they decided what lands are rezoned, as we all know to our cost.</p>

A dispute is pending following attempts over the past two years to reduce the airport's cost base.  A crisis is imminent following much discussion.  Will the Minister come to the House to outline whether a Labour Court intervention will be sought to bring both sides in this dispute together to reach a resolution?  He might indicate an initiative to bring that about.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">It is said the measure of a democracy is how a society looks after those who are unable to look after themselves and, from that point of view, we are open to severe criticism because of the lack of speech, language and occupational therapists.  In future years, this period will be looked on as a disgrace because we have let ourselves down.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Yesterday the Irish stock market lost €4 billion.  In the past, this would only have been of great concern to wealthy people who invested in it but nowadays it concerns a large number of citizens.  Most pensions are invested in equities and many people invested in equity-based SSIAs.  However, they should not panic, although they should not assume the market will bounce back.  Many SSIA holders will have the opportunity to cash in from tomorrow but they might be wiser to hold on.  In the past people panicked and that was not helpful.  Yesterday's events offer a reminder that those who put their careers and livelihoods into equities rather than secure guaranteed futures take a chance.  They could become very wealthy but a large number of people do not succeed in business and this is a reminder that businesses can fluctuate.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Part of our task is to make sure we make the country attractive for business.  Senators Maurice Hayes and Norris referred to the lack of investment in the Office of Corporate Enforcement.  Better regulation is required because there is the possibility that unsuitable red tape and regulations from Europe or from our Government will make this a less attractive place in which to set up a business and for business to succeed.  Therefore, pensioners and SSIA investors will not have the guarantee of business success.  Better regulation should be high on our agenda.</p>

Listening to the news on radio on Sunday morning, it was hard to believe something so tragic could happen.  We take so much for granted in regard to people providing these emergency services, such as ambulance drivers, firemen and gardaí.  If a car crash occurs, one telephones the Garda or the fire brigade.  We should recognise the work done by these fantastic people who do not know what they will face when they attend an accident.  I would like to remember all the people in these services and offer our full support.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">I agree with Senator Brian Hayes on the need to fill vacancies in the health service.  I was amazed to learn recently at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that some staff in the health service need only give one months' notice.  I suggested it should be extended to at least three months and that people should not be allowed to leave their jobs until they have been filled.  That is what happens in teaching where one gives at least three months' notice.  It is very unfair on the employer who must fill the vacancy.  The problem is the patient suffers because no service is provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Why do clinical psychologists get funding from the Health Service Executive to do doctorates but educational psychologists do not?  Perhaps the Leader will check that anomaly with the Minister.  We need both types of psychologists urgently, yet funding is provided to one but not the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">I agree with Senator Ó Murchú about FÁS.  Another issue which might be included in a debate on FÁS is the quality of the stamps paid in respect of people on FÁS schemes.  It has been brought to my attention that when people who have worked on FÁS schemes and who have made a huge contribution need to retire or draw benefits, their stamps are not what they should be.  Perhaps we might consider the stamps people on FÁS schemes pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">We have all become very pro-environment lately, and rightly so.  I asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about rain harvesters.  A rain harvester is a very simple tool which collects the rain that falls on roofs and surfaces.

It is very sad that there is no tablet to mark from where the earls embarked on their ship to the Continent in 1607.  I gather responsibility for this may be our old friend private property.

I presume that relates to designated land or land zoned for housing and where there is a failure to develop it.

The Senator said there are 25 unfilled positions in Dublin city and county.  The reason is the HSE has laid down the need for three years' training before people can take up a position with it.

He also raised the issue of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board which was only ever to deal with two thirds of cases.  The Independent Senators say they never get appointed to anything.  The very worthy Independent Senator, however, declared he is vice chairman of the PIAB.  He is doing a great job.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">As Senator Ross would write, Senator O'Toole was appointed by the bearded ones.  Senator Glynn raised the matter of the young 14 year old boy.  We have all read about the case with much horror.  I do not wish to prejudice the outcome of the investigation.  However, every child is curious and, at the same time, vulnerable.  It is a combination of wanting to know more and wanting to explore and perhaps a person's vulnerability being preyed upon by other people.  I do not know the full facts of the case.  Senator O'Toole also referred to the gross neglect of landlords towards tenants and how some tenants are advised to see the chairperson of the residents' association, which seems a bit cavalier.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Senator Bannon raised the matter of appointments to semi-State boards.  I have great experience of going into a Department which had been expertly handled by former Ministers Lowry and Dukes, and finding so many people on State boards who were of Senator Bannon's noble party.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">Anyone I appointed was full of merit.  They were bursting with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Senator Maurice Hayes wondered whether language therapists could have a trainees or apprenticeship stage before they become fully appointed.  What a good idea.  He also brought up the issue, which other speakers did afterwards, of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  He supports the cap on numbers in the public service.  However, he believes a method should be found to steer a way to providing the numbers required in sensitive areas while still keeping faith with the cap.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Senator Norris also raised the issue of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and business standards.  He raised the matter of No. 13 on the Order Paper and welcomed this morning's statement by the clergy which more or less echoed what he stated in the motion on the Seanad Order Paper about human rights.  He also raised the issue of the 14 year old boy and stated he showed dignity and composure in his dealing with the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Senator White certainly has petrol stations on her mind.  I understand what she is talking about because she spoke to me before she came into the House.  She knows they are owned privately and nobody can snap them up or rob people of them.  However, in her view the planning authorities do not debate properly what should be in an area.  Seven petrol stations along her route have closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">Senator O'Meara raised the alleged incident involving the 14 year old boy.  She also suggested Internet training courses for parents.  One can imagine a young person with all this knowledge and discovery at his fingertips on the Internet and having a natural curiosity.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">Senator Brennan praised Garda Brian Kelleher and fireman Michael Liston.  Yesterday, Senator Leyden raised the matter officially in the House.  I understand fully Senator Brennan's need to raise the issue, particularly as he is from the area.  We do wish to record our sympathy to those who, in times of difficulty, come to our aid throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Senator McHugh raised an issue regarding Newtowncunningham.  His point was that people live in dormitory towns but do not avail of services there.  They go to the main cities to do so.  That is free choice.  This point concerns capacity building whereby local communities obtaining capacity building skills can enable them to provide good services of which people would avail.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Senator Dooley raised the matter of the payscales of speech and language therapists.  They go into private practice because they receive very good rates of pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Senator Ross raised the matter of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  He discussed semi-State bodies and what Fine Gael and Labour did in their day.  Senator Bannon is gone.  He will not have any lectures at all so he was right.</p>

He described a participant who did not have a job and was then employed by FÁS.  He now wakes up with something to go to, and can wash, shave and dress and then go.  The man stated it was like coming to paradise.  I understand how he would feel.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Senator Coonan supports what Senator Brian Hayes stated about speech therapists.  He also wants a debate on the obvious disparity of speed limits.  He also called for a debate on the lack of planners.  Planners come and go.  They bring in a wave of new ideology such as one can only have a single storey house.  However, when one seeks them they are gone.  The file is then dumped on another planner who may not have the same type of planning ideology.  We have vacancies for planners in Westmeath.  We should have a debate on planning when these issues could be raised.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">Senator Quinn raised the matter of speech, language and occupational therapies.  He also advised us not to panic over the news from Japan and China about shares.  The Senator referred to the matter of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  He stated we do not want to go too far in enforcing regulation on firms.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Senator Scanlon supports what Senator Brennan stated about firefighters and gardaí.  Senator Browne raised the matter of the dearth of educational psychologists.  He also raised the issue that FÁS employees are not on full stamps.  He also spoke about rain barrels.  I remember when I grew up everybody had a rain barrel out the back.  One trapped the water which was supposed to be good for washing one's hair.  My mother always stated so.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, will introduce a scheme for rain barrels for farm sheds and houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Senator Mansergh was in his Tipperary abú mood.  He praised Senators Ó Murchú and Coonan.  He also spoke about the flight of the earls in 1607, in which Senator McHugh has a great interest, and raised the matter in the House last year.  Senator Mansergh spoke about John O'Leary who was also a Tipperary man.  He is clearly imbued with constituency pride on this day.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_205">I have some queries regarding subsection (2) in particular, which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_206">[I]t shall be a defence to a defamation action for the defendant to prove that the statement in respect of which the action was brought was -</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_207">(<i>a</i>) made in either House of the Oireachtas by a member of either House of the Oireachtas,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_208">(<i>b</i>) contained in a report of a statement, to which <i>paragraph (a)</i> applies, produced by or on the authority of either such House[.]</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Is there any qualification to this?  If, for example, any report is published by the House and turns out to be incorrect, or a doubt arises subsequently and the publishers are aware through other information or sources that it is defamatory, can any action be taken to correct this?  I am mindful of the Abbeylara case and the extent to which it might have implications for this section.  It was found in that case that committees of these Houses did not have the capacity to adjudicate on matters which would affect the character or reputation of people,</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Paragraph (<i>k</i>) states that the defence shall be extended to action “made in proceedings before a committee of either House of the Oireachtas”.  Will the Minister clarify this?  In general, where outside bodies appear before committees of the Oireachtas, there would be a declaration by the Chairman that, while Members have privilege, people appearing before the Oireachtas do not.  Are we extending the privilege of publication to people who do not have privilege in the first instance?</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I will comment on paragraph (<i>m</i>) but it is a general point relating to tribunals.  There has been much adverse comment in respect of people who appeared before tribunals at different stages, especially where the tribunal was hearing the case before the defendant had a right to respond to some of the allegations being made.  Often it could take weeks for such people to put their side of the case.  I have great misgivings about that.  This may have more to do with the <i>modus operandi</i> of tribunals than it would have with the Defamation Bill.  I must respect that, where we have a public tribunal, the press must be in a position to report on its proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">My concerns are primarily about the paragraphs relating to the Oireachtas where somebody appearing before a committee does not have privilege and makes a statement defamatory to a third party that could be subsequently published.  It seems there should be a way of correcting that.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">The point I would like to make falls in between sections 14 and 15.

          <p eId="para_217">I see.  My point falls between the two sections and this is presumably the only time when I will have a chance to make it.  I was indicating that a new subsection should state: "Where the defendant relies upon truth as a defence, he or she should be obliged in the pleadings containing the defence to set out the facts upon which they will rely in the defence."</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I will make two points which should appeal to the Minister.  This would enshrine in legislation what is a reasonably general practice in the courts.  It also gives the verifying affidavits, about which the Minister spoke so eloquently on the previous occasion, considerably greater relevance regarding trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Will the Minister consider inserting between sections 14 and 15 a new subsection containing this stipulation, essentially that there should be a recital of the facts upon which the defence will rely?  It is fair practice and it occurs regularly in the courts.  It would also strengthen the case made by the Minister, which I queried, about the verifying affidavits.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_221">Senator Norris is seeking a new provision requiring people, where they plead what used to be justification, to set out the facts upon which they will rely with regard to such justification.  I will look at that between now and Report Stage.  I believe it is already covered by rules of court but I could be wrong, and I do not know if it is necessary to put it into primary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">On Senator Jim Walsh's point, I am aware that some people do or do not have absolute privilege in respect of statements made in committee.  From memory, the Constitution confers absolute privilege on Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of statements they make, but non-Members are in a slightly different situation.  I will look at the matter and see if we need to tidy it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I am aware that the legislation dealing with the privilege of people testifying before committees means such people are dealt with on a sub-constitutional basis, if I can use that phrase.  As I understand it, both Houses have now enacted Standing Orders which give people the right to contradict defamatory statements made about them in either House.  That is to some extent a countermeasure to the absolute privilege conferred by the Constitution.</p>

There is a time lapse and the concern would be that an initial publication could be very damaging or injurious to the affected person.

          <p eId="para_227">Amendment No. 6 to section 16 and amendment No. 7 to section 18 are technical drafting amendments.  Amendment No. 8 to section 18, which provides for the defence of honest opinion, ensures that the reference in that section to section 16 on the defence of qualified privilege should be in accordance with all of section 16 and not limited to subsection 16(2).</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_228">I am opposing section 18 because the notion of honest opinion seems to be a libeller's charter, as it was known for some time.  One must be careful about allowing someone to put something in a newspaper because he or she believes it to be true when it is untrue.  It would not be fair, particularly when combined with the extraordinary distinction drawn later in the Bill, implicitly if not clearly stated, between public figures and ordinary citizens.  This follows an American judgment some years ago.  It is not enough that people believe something is right.  They should be required to prove the sting of the libel to prove they are right.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Could the Minister return subsection 18(3)(<i>a</i>) to the draftspeople and ask them to draft it in comprehensible English?  It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_230">Where a defendant pleads the defence of honest opinion and the opinion concerned is based on allegations of fact to which <i>subsection (2)(b)(i)</i> applies, that defence shall fail unless the defendant proves the truth of those allegations, but the defence shall not fail by reason only of the defendant’s failing to prove the truth of all of those allegations if the opinion is honest opinion having regard to the allegations of fact the truth of which is proved.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">How in the name of God could an ordinary person or a qualified lawyer understand this collection of gobbledegook?  If I read that in a Trinity essay, I would fail the student.  It is a collection of suspended clauses and deferred premises.  It is ghastly.  Perhaps some of my brighter colleagues know what the subsection refers to, but I lost the principal clause by the time I was half way through.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Could the draftspeople insert an occasional full stop as a courtesy to the weary reader and to break up the sentence?  It would give one an opportunity to know what the law is about.  Good law is understandable by the citizen and does not require a legal Einstein to know what is happening.  I am not blaming the current draftspeople because I have a feeling this wording was lifted from the 19th century and stuck into the Bill.  When we lift these archaic paragraphs, they should be expressed in plain English.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_241">Perhaps it is the way the Minister read it, but I could follow what he said while I could not understand the proposed subsection.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_242">I was quoting the older section.  The new subsection may be phrased less eloquently.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Regarding the law in respect of fair comment and the defence of honest opinion, juries often believed that while someone held an opinion, it was not a fair one.  They misunderstood the nature of the law.  That juries needed to decide whether something was an honest view rather than a fair one needed to be hammered home to them constantly.  The issue of fairness did not arise.  "Fair comment" was a bad label for a defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">If one makes a defamatory comment by reference to facts that are not in contest or can be proven to be true, holding it as an honest opinion is a full defence.  It is an important part of freedom of speech.  For example, if I said that because Senator Norris did A, B and C, he is unsuitable to be a lecturer in Trinity College Dublin or a Member of the Oireachtas and that he is a total disgrace and a dishonest man, my opinions would be based on facts.  If people can refer my opinion to facts in respect of which I am in a position to prove or that are accepted as true, my statement is an expression of opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Opinion does not defame.  That I have a clearly identifiable opinion of someone does not damage that person because people are entitled to say that it is only an opinion.  It is not a slander or a libeller's charter to distinguish between statements of fact that are false and honest judgments arrived at by people.  If we were to trim down this measure, we would make a serious mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The concept of fair comment is often misunderstood by juries and, once, by a non-jury Circuit Court regarding a case in which I was involved.  There was an overriding feeling on the part of the juries and the judge to ask whether something was a fair opinion to have of someone, but that is not the current law.  One does not need to be fair.  If one is honest, one can be intemperate and prejudiced.  For example, someone in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> recently wrote the opinion that I should be arrested.  I do not know why, as I did not read the article after reading the headline, but it was published.  It was a view of the world, but as long as the person did not write something false about me, he or she is entitled to that opinion.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_250">That would have been a different matter.  The writer could have stated that the facts of a particular case warranted my arrest, but it looked like a statement of opinion rather than a statement of fact that I had done something unlawful.  I tend to take these matters with a grain of salt.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">It is important to have a system of law in which people's honest opinions are statable when they are based on facts.  People's judgments on the consequences of matters that are proven or accepted to be true are only judgments.  I accept that a commentator in the media gets much more currency for his or her judgments than someone who has to read some of this rubbish on occasions, and sit on a barstool and give opinions to three or four people who might or might not listen.   I agree that sometimes the media are in a far more powerful position to express their opinions than an ordinary individual.  Even accepting that, we must accept the proposition that honest opinion on the basis of facts, proven or accepted, should be the subject of a defence.  We do not want to change the law fundamentally to make it less restrictive in this manner.  I do not believe it is a defamers' charter to leave the law substantially as it is in that regard.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_252">I thank the Minister for his clarification.  My objection is to the idea that at the time of the publication statement, the defendant believed in the truth of opinion or, where the defendant is not the author of the opinion but believed the author believed it to be true.  However, I see that is subject to subsection (3), and that is the one I had difficulty with because I do not believe it is sufficiently clear.  Nonetheless, the Minister makes a reasonable case as regards opinion based on clear fact.  That makes it somewhat less obnoxious, even to me.  Perhaps the Minister might look again at redrafting subsection (3), however.</p>

They were much better and clearer than what we are getting now.  Surely the point of concern is covered by subsection (2)(<i>b</i>)(i) and (ii).  That clarifies the position reasonably well in the way the Minister is doing. </p>

        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_254">I shall deal with section 18 when we get to it.  On amendment No. 8, I did not catch the reason given earlier for deleting "in accordance with <i>section 16(2)</i>”.  What effect does that have on the interpretation by the courts of qualified privilege?  I should have thought section 16(2) gave some clarity as regards how that might be interpreted.  I wonder about its implications, which are not immediately obvious to me.  The original referred to an opinion based on allegations of fact in which the defence of qualified privilege in accordance with section 16(2) would apply.  In effect, qualified privilege is being qualified by section 16(2).  Now we have removed that reference to section 16(2) and I wonder that the import of that will be. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_255">Section 16(2) is the general defence of qualified privilege.  This is to deal with situations where somebody says something which is factually untrue such as "You are a thief" or words to that effect.  However, if the person thought on the occasion that he or she said the words that the man in question was a thief, that is an occasion of qualified privilege and as such is a defence.  For example if one says to a garda one is urging to arrest another individual "This man is a thief — he's just stolen my car", then regardless of the fact that he is not a thief, that is an occasion of qualified privilege as long as one did not act maliciously by being reckless as regards whether the assertion was true, or knew it was false.  One may see somebody outside one's house getting into one's car, call a garda and say, "This man has just tried to steal my car" when the reality is that he had found the keys and was just checking out whom they belonged to and is wholly innocent.  The fact one has totally misjudged the situation and made a defamatory statement to the garda to the effect that the man is a thief is the subject of qualified privilege because one honestly believed it was true.  One had a reason to say it at the time to the garda in that one had an interest in communicating the message and the garda had an interest in receiving the information.  That is what qualified privilege is concerned with.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Honest opinion, however, is a different concept here.  Whereas the same test of malice applies in both, honest opinion is a statement of opinion based on facts which are either proved or accepted.  In section 19 there is an interesting test as to what is opinion and what is not, in cases that are, effectively, a mixed bag of opinion and fact.  I recall on one occasion a journalist writing about a judge's sentencing decision and the comments he made in the context of it, where he said: "What kind of judicial idiocy is this?"  A question arose in the High Court as to whether the assertion that it was judicial idiocy amounted to a statement of opinion or fact.  I will not go into the case but I remember it vividly because I was involved in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Section 19 is designed to set out rules for distinguishing between statements of opinion and fact.  The extent to which something may be capable of being proved is one of the issues one must bear in mind.  The extent to which a statement was made in circumstances in which it was likely to have been reasonably understood as a statement of opinion rather than a statement of conviction and allegation of fact, is a second.  The words used in a statement and the extent to which they were subject to a qualification or disclaimer or accompanied by cautionary words must be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">If one said Senator Norris or whoever was totally disreputable and unfit to be a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas——</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_260">——and put in the phrase, "in my opinion", that would clearly have to be taken into the equation in deciding whether this was an occasion for pleading the defence of honest opinion.  Those three rules are set out there to guide the court.  If I just said, "Senator A is wholly disreputable and should not be a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas", out of the blue, without any factual background for the statement, that would be defamatory.  However, if I said this half way through his or her performance in a particular debate or whatever, then people would say it was obviously said having regard to the circumstances.  If I added, "in my opinion", that would bring the statement further across the line into the realm of opinion.  If one is trying to distinguish between opinion and fact, for instance, how could one prove somebody is unsuitable to be a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Could one argue that there were worse or better Members elected, or that the individual in question is not the worst, the best or whatever?  Those types of things are mixed issues.  However, the defence of honest opinion is designed to be one in which the factual basis of the defamatory opinion is either understood or proven.  Either it is accepted there were facts which could give rise to one's honest opinion or else one can prove the facts that gave rise to it.</p>

She is calling the show "Allegedly" and after every defamatory comment she makes about her neighbour she says, "...allegedly, allegedly".

        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_192">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_274">We have had a good debate on this point.  Senator Norris raised issues about the amendments that pertain to the section and the Minister gave an outline of honest opinion.  From the point of view of mounting a defence, given that the legislation will obviously be interpreted by the courts, the entitlements of the plaintiff and the defendant will be tested in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Section 18(2)(<i>a</i>) states: “[Where] the defendant believed in the truth of the opinion or, where the defendant is not the author of the opinion, believed that the author believed it to be true”.  How can the court establish that as a fact rather than it being simply used as a defence?  If an editor or reporter states under oath that what he or she wrote was his or her honest opinion at the time, it appears it would be difficult for that to be tested by a defendant.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">I have a query about section 18(3)(<i>a</i>) which probably is somewhat related.  Senator Norris referred to the convoluted language in it and I understand the Minister said he will examine if it can be simplified.  The Minister may correct me on this, but in regard to the affidavit that must be presented at the start of a case by the plaintiff and the replying affidavit that must be presented by the defendant, it strikes me that in the case of the plaintiff, the person who is being allegedly defamed, there will be a clear-cut identification of that individual.  In the case of the defendant, the article in question might have been written by a reporter.  In whose name will the affidavit be presented?  Will it be the defendant, the reporter or somebody else within the organisation concerned?  If a defence of honest opinion is being claimed, that should be clearly stated in the affidavit by all the parties involved to ensure that if it is tested and found during the case that the defence of honest opinion is not upheld and that the opinion is not held honestly, there would be repercussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">This comes back to the thrust of ensuring that the legislation is balanced to ensure that the defendant has certain rights under it as well.  From my reading of the section, it appears as if this defence may not be supported other than during the case.  It would strengthen the issues involved and it may even strengthen the settlement of cases before they ever go through the court process, which is cumbersome and expensive, if it were made a requirement that such a claim in a case would have to be stated in a sworn affidavit at the outset.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_278">Section 18(2)(<i>a</i>) states “where the defendant is not the author of the opinion, believed that the author believed it to be true”.  If a person says Joe Bloggs in the <i>Evening Herald</i> said something with which he or she completely agrees but which turns out to be defamatory, is that the type of example contemplated in the provision?  Perhaps the Minister could give the House an example of a situation in which somebody makes a defamatory statement relying on an opinion of somebody else?  I take it that it is a question of agreement with a statement being made by some other party.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">With regard to the question of honest opinion and fair comment, it is probably difficult sometimes to prove that it is not a fair comment or honest opinion.  There was a case some years ago, which the Minister may remember, where a journalist with Senator Maurice Hayes's group of newspapers wrote an article in the aftermath of a situation in which a District Court judge had been very snotty about the use of mobile phones in court and gave a long diatribe from the Bench about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Subsequently, another judge had a telephone on the Bench which rang and the journalist wrote an article exposing this, mocking and ridiculing it and holding the Judiciary up to contempt over this issue, suggesting that its members were not practising what they preached.  However, the judge had a good reason for having the telephone because there was no working telephone installation in the court and he was awaiting information which was germane to the hearing of the case.  It was in the professional discharge of his duty that the telephone rang.  It was able to be proved subsequently that the journalist knew the situation because he had read the original article, and as a result, the defence failed.  Perhaps the Minister remembers that case.  I presume this provision would operate in the same way, namely, if it could be demonstrated that a journalist manipulated the facts while knowing there was a good reason for what appeared to the public to be a kind of contradiction.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">People got very offended by overhearing a conversation on a mobile phone, but were not offended by hearing the conversation of two people walking down the street.  They thought it was very rude to have a mobile phone conversation on a bus or a train.  Mores change and while leaving a mobile phone switched on in court is slightly irritating, it is not a capital offence and should not be dealt with as a contempt.  It is prissy to get too worried about it.  It is also irritating when someone's mobile phone rings on Committee Stage of Bills in this House, but it is not worth getting up in a heap about.  The dignity of the courts would be affected if everybody wantonly disregarded the instruction to turn off mobile phones.  However, the dignity of a court is not such that it must be protected by punishing people who, in good faith, forget to turn off their mobile phones.  It happens to us all.  I am carrying a mobile phone as I speak, but it has not interrupted us yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Where the defendant is the person who published the statement and wrote it, the section is fairly simple.  However, where the defendant is The Irish Times Limited<b> </b>or Independent News and Media and the article in question has been written by Senator Norris about the Polish President or the Pope, it is not a matter for the newspaper editor to say that he believes that the Senator’s opinion is correct, or that he shares his opinion.  It is a matter for him to say that he believes it is the Senator’s honest opinion and that he is not writing it maliciously.  That is a fair standard.  If the Senator wants to make a very critical onslaught on somebody based on agreed facts, the editor of the newspaper should not be required to prove the state of his mind.  The editor should be entitled to say he believes the Senator believed this was an honest opinion.  It would put an impossible onus on editors if they had to share the opinion or else prove what went on in someone else’s head, who might not even be available as a witness.  One could publish a syndicated article and be in desperate trouble if the author of the article lived in Australia.  The article could manifestly be an opinion, but the editor could not prove the state of mind of the author.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The verifying affidavit provided in section 7 deals with assertions or allegations of fact.  I am subject to correction, but I do not think one would have to put in an affidavit dealing with questions of honesty of opinion.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_288">On that point, the issue is how it is interpreted.  I can see the distinction and the Minister has clearly defined the difference between statements of fact and honest opinion.  However, in my mind, there is not an established and definite mark between honest opinion and issues relating to facts that could be held as honest opinion.  Are there any cross-references that can be made in that area?  I am being critical of this in defence of people who are defamed in a system where the legal costs are very significant and who are putting a lot at risk, something which is not the case with defendants, which are often corporations with very significant resources.  Equally, many of the newspapers and the vast majority of our reporters and publications are responsible and report very responsibly.  However, there is a small number that go in the opposite direction, often driven by the profit motive and an increase in circulation.  There is evidence of this happening in Britain and people within the media have acknowledged that there can be a race to the bottom in terms of standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Much pejorative terminology is used in newspapers about "disgraced" individuals, but it is a matter of opinion whether a person is disgraced or not.  That can be damaging to someone's reputation.  There should be a clear distinction between something that one can challenge as an untrue statement and an opinion that can be damaging.  The casual reader of a newspaper may not make a fine distinction between what is fact and what is opinion.  We need to have some safeguards in that area, but I do not know how to do it.  There should be a threshold that must be crossed to illustrate the distinction to the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">In claiming the defence of honest opinion, one can sometimes see the prejudice running through the reporting.  The old adage that the pen is mightier than the sword is very true.  I have concerns for people, who may not be popular with the media, being vilified purely for the sake of vilification, rather than having to put up with a genuine expression of honest opinion.  I do not know what can be done, but I would like to see the Bill strengthened so that there is a strong test for defendants to prove honest opinion.  I do not detect that from the section or from other parts of the Bill.  Perhaps nothing can be done, but I would like to put my concerns on the record.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_291">Section 19 deals with distinguishing fact and opinion.  Sometimes a newspaper can express an opinion in the heading, so that is very clear.  There has been a trend to inject an opinion into reporting.  It is rare nowadays to read pure reporting of facts.  We may be copying the trend that is found in the British media, but when one goes to other countries, there seems to be a much finer definition between the reporting of issues and opinions expressed in articles inside the newspapers.  Here, things are something of a mishmash.  I have concerns in that regard.  We seem to be putting our faith in certain sections that standards will be maintained and, perhaps, improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Legislation should defend the right of newspapers to be an important component of democracy and society by allowing them free speech.  On the other hand, we must balance this right with the right of individuals not to be damaged through reporting.  We must not put a hurdle in the way that will prevent them from getting correction for a defamation or injury done to them.  We must be mindful of that.  I am conscious the newspapers are in favour of this section; I have not heard any opposition to it.  The people who might be the victims in this area do not have a voice and that is a concern.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">I have to agree with Senator Walsh.  Not every newspaper person thinks it is a good thing that fact and opinion are mixed to the extent they are.  I belong to the C.P. Scott school that facts are sacred but comment is free.  It is important to ensure that comment remains free in this area.  There have been slippages in journalistic standards, not only in Ireland, but generally and it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between facts enunciated and comments put or side notes.  However, the section is adequate to allow the courts distinguish between these and, to borrow a phrase, teach people manners.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_294">I must agree with Senators Walsh and Hayes.  The section does not just deal with basic standards of truthfulness and professionalism, which, unfortunately are sometimes lacking in media coverage of events.  There is a low standard set in some areas, which I must deprecate.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I remember coming to the House once and deciding, in order to promote the use of Irish, that I would deliver a Second Stage speech in Irish.  I also provided the speech, in English, to each Member.  The following Friday, I was contacted by a reporter from <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and was asked why I had made the speech in Irish and whether I had an ulterior motive.  I replied there was no ulterior motive and that I had circulated the speech in English.  Although the newspaper people knew that, on Sunday they wrote an article implying I had an ulterior motive and deliberately concealed the fact I had circulated my speech in English.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The clear message of the article was that I was up to no good using the Irish language and that there was something suspicious about my action.  The one fact deliberately concealed in the newspaper report was that I had circulated a translation to every Member.  This was done to prop up a story that was fundamentally untrue, that I had an underhand motive in speaking in Irish and was trying to conceal from the public what I was doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">This kind of fundamental departure from decent standards of plain, intellectual honesty are to be deeply regretted.  This case is just one that stuck in my mind because of the deliberate excision of a fact from the story, which the newspaper knew about two days before publishing the story.  However, it decided the story would be better and more coherent and impressive if the truth was suppressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I agree with Senator Walsh that we cannot, in defamation law, set standards for the whole of the media.  However, there are some areas of journalism where people feel free to suppress facts.  I agree with Senator Hayes, facts are sacred but comment is free.  If <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> had stated on its front page that day that I had circulated my speech in both languages, the story would have looked absurd and would not have merited one column inch.  This is the kind of thing one must put up with.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Standards vary internationally.  On one occasion I spoke to a journalist from <i>The New York Times</i> where internal standards are impressive compared to many newspapers of which I have some knowledge.  If one of its journalists is found to be inaccurate or unfair, the editor requires a written statement from the said journalist setting out why a particular fact drawn to his attention was left out of the story.  There is internal accountability in the office to keep up the high standard of the newspaper.  I doubt that happens much in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">I remember the incident mentioned by the Minister and was here when the Minister delivered his speech as Gaeilge.  He was commended by all sides for taking the opportunity to use the Irish language, which should be used more often.  I also saw the subsequent newspaper article.  The article illustrates a certain prejudice, by either the paper or the reporter.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">That was not an isolated incident.  Many times people have opinions and use the press to promote those opinions.  They are entitled to do so but that opinion may sometimes be defamatory or damage somebody.  If that happens, there is nothing in the Bill to deal with that or to correct or give consolation to the person damaged or injured by those opinions.  It is in that regard that we are going too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I remember attending a conference in Belfield which was initiated by the Minister on the area of defamation and privacy.  I found it interesting and, if I recall correctly, the NUJ spokesman stated there was a lowering of standards.  A person from our neighbouring island who was present said standards there had demonstrably been reduced over a considerable length of time.  How can we impose standards on the recalcitrant elements of the media if this legislation makes it almost prohibitive for anybody to pursue a case on defamation?  I have serious concerns in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">I accept there is a need to modernise the legislation in this area.  However, we should distinguish between allegations of fact and opinion and I agree with what Senator Maurice Hayes said in that regard.  Can we not get to a stage where we provide for statements of fact in reporting so that we will get reporting of the facts?  If somebody wants to give an opinion, let it be in another article, but let it be known that it is an opinion and let them be free to do that.  Where both fact and opinion are mixed, stories are not generally in the interest of getting the truth to the public, which should be the primary objective of newspapers.</p>

Senator Maurice Hayes ought not think people will be fooled by that.  I certainly am not, even though its head is the former Provost of Trinity College.  Every time there is a problem in another profession this is a group that calls for independence.  Independence suits for everybody else, but not for the newspapers which finance the council.  I am not gulled by that rubbish.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I agree with Senator Jim Walsh's point about the impact of the British media which, by and large, is a disgrace.  It is worrying because market forces operate and our own newspapers' standards are being driven down by their low standards.  For that reason, it is highly regrettable that over the past two mornings the news programme on Radio Éireann between 7 o'clock and 9 o'clock has led with meretricious stories from the tabloids, which are British not even Irish.

          <p eId="para_316">Incidentally, this replicates section 21 of the 1961 Act, where it is called unintentional defamation.  The purpose of this procedure is to allow a person who has unintentionally defamed somebody to make amends.  It is rarely used.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The kernel of it is evident in section 21(2) of the  Bill, which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_318">Subject to <i>subsection (3)</i>, it shall be a defence to a defamation action for a person to prove that he or she made an offer to make amends under <i>section 20</i> and that it was not accepted, unless the plaintiff proves that the defendant knew or ought reasonably to have known at the time of making the statement to which the offer relates that-</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_319">(<i>a</i>) it referred to the plaintiff or was likely to be understood as referring to the plaintiff, and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_320">(<i>b</i>) it was false and defamatory of the plaintiff.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">If the plaintiff proves that the defendant knew that, then the entire matter is inoperable.  This would deal with situations, which have arisen from time to time, where a person writing a fictional book or an article in a magazine, for instance, would select a name such as Jim Walsh from New Ross and place Senator Jim Walsh into a context where many would say that it was he when it might just be that the author selected a name for the purpose of making a point.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">There is no traction at all in this defence if the person knows that first, it was likely to refer to the plaintiff and, second, that on the face of it was false and defamatory.  It is fair enough if, in the course of a television film, a person selected Senator Jim Walsh of New Ross and stated subsequently that he or she did not know that there was a Senator Jim Walsh, but that defence would not avail the person at all unless he or she establishes that he or she was totally innocent and merely picked the name out of the telephone book one afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">It is a fairly narrow provision and it has rarely been used in the courts.  One might even argue that it could be got rid of, only for the fact that it is part of the current law and I would be loath to take away something for a totally innocent defamation.  For example, supposing a photograph of a person accused of murderer coming out of court appeared and somehow the reporter opened the wrong page of the spiral notebook and put down a name, or got the name completely confused, or could not read his or her own handwriting, and said it was James McNamara when it was James Moriarty, that could be a totally unintentional defamation of James McNamara because the accused might have had a hood over his head and it could be an innocent mistake.  In such circumstances, an offer to make amends would be available.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I apologise for forgetting to deal with that issue.  Subsection (3) is designed to state that this is only available to a defendant at the very beginning.  One cannot submit a defence stating that this is not defamatory, it is true or it did not refer to the plaintiff, and then decide to consider pulling the rug from under the plaintiff.  At a late stage in the proceedings when a person has set out the defence, he or she cannot then go back to the offer to make amends.  However, it does not prevent a person from settling an action or from compromising an action on terms.</p>

One cannot submit one's defence and afterwards state one is taking a totally different approach to the case, such that one will invoke the defence of an offer to make amends.  It does not stop one doing all the things one could do to make amends in substance but it would not be considered an offer or give rise to the defence.</p>

It has been very often the case that, where a headline blackguarded an individual, the apology was not accorded due prominence.  Let us not beat around the bush, this is what newspapers do as a matter of course.  I therefore regard the provision as a corrective and the attention of editors should be drawn to the fact that they are required, under law, to give due prominence to their apologies.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_344">In page 18, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following subsection:</p>

          <p eId="para_346">Subsection 1, as it stands, allows an apology to mitigate damage but the amendment is to encourage early apologies.  We suggest that apologies made only within 14 days should be regarded as effecting substantial mitigation of damage.  Late apologies could effect some mitigation, but not substantial mitigation.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I do not know.  It is like trying to define an elephant — one just knows what it is.  Similarly, one knows whether an apology is an apology.  A definition of an elephant might not get one very far.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The section is purely in respect of the mitigation of damage.  It requires that it be done either before the bringing of the action or as soon as is practicable thereafter in circumstances where the action was commenced before there was an opportunity to make or offer an apology.  I do not know whether the 14-days rule would be practical in most cases.  The matter probably should be decided by reference to the circumstances of publication.  For instance, if a book with defamatory material were published, 14 days might seem an irrelevance, but it might seem like an age to a person defamed by a newspaper.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Section 22(3) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_351">In a defamation action, an apology made by or on behalf of a defendant in respect of a statement to which the action relates—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_352">(<i>a</i>) does not constitute an express or implied admission of liability by that defendant, and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_353">(<i>b</i>) is not relevant to the determination of liability in the action.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">This is a new provision.  The policy behind this section is to encourage newspapers to apologise rather than argue that doing so is putting their heads in a noose and kicking the lever in respect of liability.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_356">I do not believe so because there are occasions on which a newspaper will admit certain circumstances look bad.  For example, a newspaper may say it did not mean to treat Senator Norris very unfairly and wants to apologise to him therefor.  It might also say, however, that it does not want to throw away all its defences if it gets into a legal brawl.  The philosophy behind the provision, therefore, is that if a newspaper's instinct is to apologise, it should be allowed to do so.  Thus, the matter would not be in the hands of lawyers who would state an apology constituted an admission that the offended party was defamed.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The provision is to try to encourage newspapers to be generous in their approach.  I agree with Senator Norris on newspapers.  It has been almost universally my experience that newspapers are ungenerous on the question of apologies and always seek to minimise their extent or effect, as if apologising were extracting teeth from them.  This is an unwise policy on their part.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">When I was a member of the Council of King's Inns, <i>The Irish Times</i> published an article stating I had attacked King’s Inns and said it represented bad value.  I was horrified because I felt all the judges and barristers would think I had become cracked and was vindictive and disloyal to an institution of which I was a member.  The truth was that Senator Derek McDowell had made the remarks.  I kicked up quite a fuss and stated the matter would not proceed any further if the newspaper apologised the following day.  However, obtaining the apology was very difficult because the newspaper wanted to apologise to Senator Derek McDowell for confusing him with me.  I stated I would sue the newspaper if it did so.  It would not admit that it got the story wrong.  Rather, it wanted to fudge and confuse the issue to suggest anybody could make the mistake that was made.  Rather than apologising to me, it wanted to bring Senator Derek McDowell into the apology by nefarious means so as to make it all a joke.  It was not a joke for me at the time.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_362">Reference should be made to an apology being timely and prominent.  The Minister is correct with regard to the begrudging nature of many of the apologies which appear in newspapers.  They are often late and small, and printed in a little read part of the newspaper, whereas they should be in a prominent position.  The more time that passes before a defamatory article is corrected, the more damage it can do to an individual's reputation.  There should be an onus on a newspaper to correct reports immediately on becoming aware they are untrue.  It should be stitched into the legislation that the apology is printed on the same page as the offending article.  To be honest, I would prefer all apologies to be printed on the front page because there is nothing in this legislation to deal with serial offenders.  Newspapers which repeatedly go to the wire in terms of defamatory articles will be treated in the same way on a case-by-case basis as a newspaper which offends for the first time.  That is wrong because sanctions are provided in all other legislation for repeat or serial transgressions.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I welcome the provision that apologies are not admissible in civil proceedings as evidence of liability as a significant and justified move in the favour of the press industry.  Given that provision, however, there should be no reservations on the part of newspapers about taking a generous approach to issuing apologies.  I hope the Minister will consider a reference to timely and prominent apologies, although I am not sure about imposing a 14-day deadline.  If the Bill required apologies to be printed on the front page, the deterrent effect on circulation would give newspapers an incentive to adhere to the code of practice to which Senator Maurice referred.  We need to stiffen the legislation to ensure compliance with proper standards and codes of ethics.</p>

          <p eId="para_370">The issue of apologies and their effects is troubling.  The Minister has substantially weakened the interest of the ordinary citizen.  I disagree that an apology would not constitute an express or implied admission of liability.  It is plain common sense that it would constitute an admission and such is the interpretation in every other area of law.  If I were involved in a traffic accident and apologised to the other party, that could be introduced as evidence of an admission.  In plain, clear logic, it is nothing other than an admission if I apologised for making a mistake or for committing libel, and the Bill is incorrect to state that such an apology does not constitute an express or implied admission.  It is like <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> to claim that saying one was wrong does not constitute an admission.  The ordinary citizen’s common sense should be respected.  I made my amendment weaker than I originally intended by including the word “automatically”, and the least the Minister can do is accept it because, otherwise, the Bill revolts common sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Subsection (4) is an outrage.  While I do not know about the Minister, are we totally crazy as politicians to say newspapers can introduce evidence of an apology in mitigation but the claimant cannot?  It is the most extraordinary proposal I have ever come across and it totally skews the balance between newspapers and the individual.  By acknowledging an error and printing an apology, a newspaper can mitigate a serious libel from its point of view, even though it is not an admission of liability or admissible in court.  On what planet do we live?  The Minister should not think my sentiments on the matter are not shared because many of his Cabinet colleagues have told me in the privacy of the Members' bar that they feel the same way.  They have thanked God that somebody has the balls to raise the issue because, although they would love to raise it themselves, they cannot do so.  Few in this House, other than Members with interests in the newspaper industry, do not feel exactly the same.  I can assure the Minister that the citizens of Ireland share my sentiments.  What is being done here revolts reason and outrages logic, and I ask the Minister to accept at a minimum that an apology does not automatically constitute an express or limited admission.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The Minister should delete subsection (4).  We are always hearing about level playing fields, yet a business organisation with enormous financial resources and insurance coverage can libel Seán and Moira citizen and then can apologise without admitting liability and introduce that apology in court as mitigation.  How does the apology mitigate anything?  The newspaper can introduce such an apology but the unfortunate individual is not allowed to do so.  On what planet do Members live?  I would like to hear other Members' opinions in this regard because, further on, it is stated that people in public life should be subject to less protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The Government has given in and has sold the pass under pressure from the newspapers.  This happens each time there is a general election.  It is not simply Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats who do this; Fine Gael did so five years ago.  They are all at it and the turkeys will vote for Christmas as long as they get a gob-full of good publicity before the general election.</p>

          <p eId="para_374">It is difficult to argue against Senator Norris's logic in this regard.  While I do not disagree with his comments, the present situation, whereby newspapers feel justifiably constrained from issuing apologies because of the inherent danger of subsequent court cases, raises a dilemma.  Subject to what the Minister will say in this regard, the intention of this provision is to allow newspapers that know they have made an error to proceed freely and publish an apology without it being part of a settlement with the injured party.  There is a certain logic to this.  This should be accompanied by the existence of an independent body, such as an independent press council, that could underpin the apology by awarding some compensation to the individual in question.  However, this is missing from the equation.</p>

          <p eId="para_380">Most people would be satisfied by an apology.  There may also be a need to combine an element of compensation with it, which is missing at present.  The establishment of an independent body that could adjudicate in a reasonable manner without all the attendant exorbitant legal costs, as does, for example, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, would be something of substance.  It would allow an ordinary citizen to make a complaint and have redress in a satisfactory way without putting his or her livelihood and that of his or her family at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">This should be done and perhaps Members will have a debate on this issue on reaching the provisions pertaining to a press council.  In this case, the removal of section 22(4) would be of some concern to me because it affords individuals an opportunity for an apology.  In many instances, those who are so offended do not have the resources to take on the might of what are now major corporations.  There is a benefit to the citizen that I am loath to strike out.  However, I do not have difficulty with the Senator's amendment regarding the word, "automatically".  It does not affect section 22(4) which is the most beneficial provision from the perspective of a defamed person.</p>

          <p eId="para_382">I had thought the purpose of this provision was to enable people to avoid litigation if they did not want to enter into it and that people who might be satisfied with an apology could receive one.  However, if people wanted to go on to litigate thereafter, consequently both sides would start from scratch as though, in a sense, the apology had not been given.  There has always been a difficulty in that newspapers were either reluctant to, could not or were advised not to make an apology and have dragged people in.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">I experienced a case of this nature myself.  A couple of years ago, a morning newspaper, which was neither the <i>Irish Independent</i> nor <i>The Irish Examiner</i>, carried an article suggesting that, in pieces I had written about Northern Ireland, I was acting as a spokesman for the Irish Government, thereby destroying my independence.  I knew and respected the young man who wrote the article and all I wanted was to get straight to the point and get him to state this was wrong and no more.  Although we eventually reached this point, to do so we were almost obliged to ignore lawyers on both sides.</p>

All Members want fair play for the ordinary Joe Soap who is defamed.  I have no problem with the amendments tabled by Senator Norris that include the word, "automatically" although I am unsure whether that will make much difference in interpretation.

I accept this may not always mitigate the harm done, in which case further litigation is possible.  It is right that apologies can be made without strict admissions of legal liability.  It would be desirable for Members to try to cut down on libel litigation and for newspapers, without putting their resources at risk, to be encouraged to make proper and full apologies.</p>

Although I was prepared to go to law, if necessary, after I had made my protest, the newspaper concerned published a letter of mine that stated the allegation made was untrue and the reasons it was untrue in order that people could judge for themselves adequately.  Thereafter, I had no interest in pursuing the case any further and am glad to note the libel has not been repeated by any source.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_391">Senator Norris is entitled to his strong conviction but he should not attribute motives to those who proposed to amend the law, which are venal or corrupt.  In 1991 the Law Reform Commission, which at the time was chaired by Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, published a report on defamation law.  On page 10 of that report it is stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_392">We referred in our Consultation Paper to the representations we had received on this subject. It appeared that, although s17 of the Defamation Act 1961 enables a defendant to give evidence in mitigation of damages as to the making or offering of an apology, the section is frequently not availed of by defendants because of a concern that an apology will be regarded as an admission of liability. We provisionally recommended that s17 should be replaced by a new provision making it clear that an apology to the plaintiff is not to be construed as an admission of liability. This proposal was generally welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The report then sets out a recommendation.  In 1991, therefore, the Law Reform Commission, which had absolutely no snivelling or leg-licking motivation regarding the media——</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_254">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_394">I am not sure I used those phrases but I am grateful for the Minister's suggestions, as they will come in handy later.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_395">Regardless of the electoral cycle involved, the Law Reform Commission, which was established by the Oireachtas, took the view that the all duck or no dinner aspect to an apology was an inhibiting factor that drove people to litigation and stopped them from acting decently because they put their heads in nooses when they did.  I agree with Senators Mansergh and Maurice Hayes that we would like people to behave in a sensible way.  If newspaper editors think they have been excessive in what they have said or if they think one of their columnists has been unfair, for example, they should be able to apologise without lawyers immediately saying the liability issue is out of the way and the newspaper's bank accounts should be opened in order that they can bring their shovels and barrows to see how much they can get away with, which is the other side of the equation.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The purpose of the provision is to create a circumstance in which defendants can write to litigants about apologies without all the time thinking they are putting their heads in a noose and kicking the lever on the liability issue.  Ordinary people would be better served if newspapers felt they could safely apologise without handing a blank cheque to the litigant whose lawyers can fill in how much he or she will take on foot of an apology.  The more full the apology, if it is taken as an admission of liability, the greater the amount that should accompany it in damages.  If the newspaper states, for example, "We deeply regret that Senator Hayes's personal feelings have been hurt in this way and we profoundly apologise to him and acknowledge the hurt we have done to him", the decimal point will move a few points to the right.  That is the attitude in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I agree, on a common sense basis, that to apologise is to admit that one has done something wrong by definition.  The policy of the statute is to encourage people to acknowledge an error.  However, if an individual makes an apology and he or she can forget about defending the case, checking the facts, qualified privilege and so on because it is open season for the lawyers, inevitably, newspaper editors and owners will say it is not worth it.  They will ascertain whether the individual is serious about the case but they cannot hand him or her a blank cheque and ask him or her to fill it in.  That is the underlying philosophy.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I fully accept Senator Norris's comment that on one level to say one is sorry is to concede an element of fault, for example, where following a car accident the man or woman in the offending car got out and said "I am terribly sorry", and it was relied on in court.  The insurance companies always said——</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_400">No, they said they were the servant or agent for the purpose of driving the car because it was a vicarious liability implied by statute.  However, they were not authorised to comment on who was to blame and it was not an admission made by the defendant.  For example, in the case of an accident if a driver hops out of a bus and says he is sorry, that does not mean CIE has made an admission that it was to blame.  However, there are artificialities in all of this but the question is what we are trying to achieve.  Are we trying to achieve a position where people deal with each other realistically and decently?</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The Law Reform Commission identified this as a problem 16 years ago and this is not being done as an act of abasement by electorally nervous politicians to the media nor is it a case of turkeys voting for Christmas.  I would be much happier, if I were defamed, to receive an apology rather than making a trip to the Four Courts and putting massive legal expenses on the hazard one way or the other of obtaining a little decency from a newspaper.</p>

My amendment is weak, as it states, "does not automatically constitute".  However, will the Minister consider its inclusion?</p>
          <p eId="para_406">With regard to the Law Reform Commission, I am delighted the Minister is so enthusiastic about its report because he has not invested in law all of its recommendations.  He is a bit of an <i>á la carte</i> person where the commission’s reports are concerned.  He picks and chooses, which is fair enough.  However, when the debate resumes I will point out other areas in which equally strong recommendations were made by the commission but the Minister chose not to take them on board.  I share the Minister’s high regard for Mr. Justice Ronan Keane but because he said something in a report 16 years ago in circumstances that have been changed by earlier sections in the legislation is not an overwhelming argument, although it must be taken into consideration.</p>

This was a tragic case.  First, and most importantly, a man lost his life, which is appalling.  His killing means his children lost their father and his wife lost her husband.  Nothing can bring him back to them or compensate them for this loss.  The second consequence of the killing of Mr. Ward was that Mr. Nally was charged with manslaughter.  Mr. Nally was later acquitted of the charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Although Mr. Nally was acquitted, it is clear from the facts of the case that he had a case to answer.  However, his prosecution raised a very important political question, namely, whether the right to self-defence from criminal attack of one's family in one's home is a general right or constrained.  Is the right to self-defence generally free as long as the defending dweller does not engage in obviously reckless or criminal behaviour?  Must the dweller observe a higher and more exacting standard?  In short, do we bend over backwards and impose impossibly exact standards of behaviour on home dwellers awoken from their sleep at 3 a.m.?</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The answer to this question depends on one's interpretation of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.  It is a general principle of law that one can act in self-defence against an attack or even against an imminent attack.  The 1997 Act qualified that right and section 20(4) states: "The fact that a person had an opportunity to retreat before using force shall be taken into account, in conjunction with other relevant evidence, in determining whether the use of force was reasonable."</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The implication of this section is that the law seemed to put a question mark over a person's right to defend his or her home and property.  It seemed to imply that if a person was awoken in his or her bedroom in the middle of the night by intruders downstairs, that person might not be able to rely on a legal defence of self-defence if he or she went downstairs and confronted the intruders.  If one's house was broken into at 3 a.m. and one made one's way downstairs and, in confronting a burglar, knocked him or her down whereupon he or she hit his or her head against the fireplace and died, one could be robbed of the legal defence of self-defence.  Not only did one not avail of an opportunity to retreat, one actually went down the stairs to confront the intruder.  Remember the exact words of the 1997 Act: "The fact that a person had an opportunity to retreat before using force shall be taken into account, in conjunction with other relevant evidence, in determining whether the use of force was reasonable."</p>
          <p eId="para_434">It seems absurd that the law of the land might imply that a person who went downstairs to defend his or her house and family from late-night intruders could not rely on self-defence to justify his or her actions.  It seems absurd that the person could end up on a manslaughter charge if the intruder was unlucky enough to bang his or her head against a hard surface and die.  In this respect at least, the 1997 Act, which was brought through the Oireachtas by the then Minister with responsibility for justice, Nora Owen, was ambiguous and gravely defective.  Let us not forget that sitting around the Cabinet table when that legislation was approved were the current leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The Defence of Life and Property Bill was the result of concern about the defects in the 1997 Act.  We introduced it in the Seanad last May.  I will outline the key elements of the Bill.  In a prosecution for assault or manslaughter, it shall be a defence for a home dweller to show that the alleged acts took place at the home of the accused or in its curtilage, that the injured person was trespassing giving rise to the reasonable inference that the trespass was done for the purpose of committing a serious criminal act, and that the acts alleged against the accused constitute the justified use of force under section 18 of the 1997 Act.  Where the first two facts are established, the home dweller's right to self-defence shall not be judged by whether he or she availed of an opportunity to retreat.  This defence will also apply in any civil proceedings which might be taken by the intruder against the home dweller.  These are reasonable provisions which would have two effects.  First, they would remove ambiguity under the current law concerning the rights of people to defend their homes against criminal attack, and second, they would strengthen the rights of dwellers over criminals.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Shortly after we published the Defence of Life and Property Bill, Fine Gael published similar proposals in their Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill in the Dáil, which is similar to our Bill but different in some key respects.  In each of these respects, the Fine Gael Bill got it wrong.  That Bill would have permitted serious assault without civil remedy.  As the Bill would have freed dwellers from any civil liability for any act taken against trespassers, it went too far.  For example, if a child was trespassing in a house, the adult dweller would be exempt from civil liability, irrespective of the force they used to thrash that child.  By contrast, our Bill only relaxes the law for dwellers where the trespasser shows criminal intent.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Fine Gael Bill limited its effects to the domestic dwelling, limiting the extra rights conferred on an occupant of a domestic dwelling to that dwelling.  If a brawl erupted between an occupant and a burglar and that brawl spilled out into the front garden, the occupant would lose the additional legal protections conferred by the Fine Gael Bill.  By contrast, our Bill extends to the area around the house and deals with somebody who sees their car being vandalised or set alight and goes out to stop it, for example.  In contrast, the Fine Gael Bill would have abandoned that person, who have had to retreat and allow his or her car to be vandalised because, outside the house, a different standard applied. That was not reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The Fine Gael Bill provided no protection in the case of manslaughter.  This may sound reasonable until one considers a case where a dweller confronts a burglar who falls down the stairs, hits his head and is killed.  The Fine Gael Bill would have offered such a dweller no protection whatever, but our Bill offers some protection to such a person.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">This Bill is a commonsense proposal designed to address a clear problem in our law.  The Nally case caused major public controversy, not all of it helpful.  It brought to our attention a clear problem in our law, although that problem did not arise in the Nally case.  Now we have been alerted to this problem, it is up to us to consider it and advance solutions to it.  This Bill does just that.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I hope my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, can accept the reforms outlined in this Bill.  Perhaps he could accept the Bill or even the thrust of the Bill in future legislation.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_283" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_441">I second the motion.  I also welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House.  Together with Senator Morrissey, I support the Second Stage of the Defence of Life and Property Bill 2006 before the Seanad.  The Bill would give full defence in criminal and civil law in cases where force is reasonably used to defend life and property against trespassing with criminal intent in people's homes and surrounding areas.  The entitlement of a householder to use justified force shall not be judged by reference to any opportunity to retreat.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Concern over defence in the 1997 Act led to the introduction of this simple Bill.  Currently, the law provides in section 25 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 consideration of whether the use of force was justified in criminal law.  An opportunity for a person to retreat before using force would be taken into account, in conjunction with other relevant evidence, in determining whether the use of force was justified.  This could mean that a person defending a family in their home could be found to have used force unjustifiably because an opportunity to retreat was not availed of.  We believe this aspect of the law to be wrong and tilted in favour of wrongdoers in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">At present, if a person's home were broken into and the burglar was knocked down by the occupant in a confrontation, whereupon the intruder hit his head on furniture and died, the occupant would be robbed of the legal defence of self-defence.  Under the 1997 Act, not only would that occupant not have availed of an opportunity to retreat, that person would have pursued the burglar in defence of family and home.  Is it right that the law of the land could imply that a person who went down the stairs to defend house and family against intruders could not rely on self-defence to justify his or her actions?  It seems daft that a person could end up with a manslaughter charge if an intruder were unlucky enough to bang his or her head against a hard surface and die.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">In this respect, the 1997 Act brought before the Oireachtas by the then Minister with responsibility for justice, former Deputy Nora Owen, was a step backwards for the rights of people defending their homes.  We ask for support for our Bill before this House and hope our colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister, Deputy Michael McDowell, will accept the reforms outlined in this Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_463">It strikes me as the purest form of hypocrisy to oppose a matter one day and propose it the next.  I believe in conviction politics, but I also believe that the best time to change one's mind is when one is wrong.  Has the Progressive Democrats Party changed its mind, has the Tánaiste decided that his party should support the rights of home owners to defend themselves in their homes and has he finally seen that Fine Gael was right when it proposed the Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill 2006 in the other House?</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Fine Gael has led the body politic in providing protection in this crucial area of law.  As part of the rainbow Government, we passed the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, significant legislation that pulled together the various assault offences and provided citizens, the Garda Síochána, the Judiciary and legal practitioners with a single reference point for law in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Latterly, we sought to improve the legislation by tweaking a small part of it through the Criminal Law (Home Defence) Bill 2006 which aimed to clarify the law in respect of home owners and intruders.  On 27 June 2006, the Bill was proposed in the Dáil by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, but the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government voted the Bill down in an act of political cowardice.  Since then, the Law Reform Commission published a report that agreed in principle with the main thrust of our Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The most important difference between the Fine Gael Bill and this one is that the latter allows murder.  It is a charter for murderers in that it would excuse a person murdering someone within his or her own home.  It is dangerous legislation compared with the Fine Gael Bill which was voted down by the Progressive Democrats and which specifically excluded any defence for murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">At the time, the Tánaiste tried to ridicule our Bill by suggesting that a gate-crasher at a party would have been subject to assault with lawful excuse.  He could not have been more disingenuous in his comments, as the Bill referred specifically to "reasonable" force being used to remove someone.  No court in the land would regard his suggestion as being reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Article 40.5 of the Constitution of Ireland states: "The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law."  This article provides the constitutional basis for the Fine Gael Bill.  Fine Gael wants to promote its strongly held opinion that the rights of the victim and not the criminal should be most protected by law.  While we in Fine Gael do not promote the excessive use of violence, we believe that an innocent person who is intruded upon in his or her home, often in the dead of night, should not have the law weighted against him or her in the quest to prove that he or she acted reasonably.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Our change in the law would have vindicated the rights of ordinary people, such as the Tánaiste and I, who attempt to protect their homes and families in the face of knife or gun-wielding intruders intent on theft or injury to the occupants.  Had the Bill been accepted by the Government, intruders might have thought twice before embarking on stealing sprees that can maim and destroy lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Further to what our party leader, Deputy Kenny, stated in his speech at our Ard-Fheis last year, Fine Gael wants to provide protection from civil liability to people who could potentially be sued by a burglar.  A householder would have had no liability for an intruder who trips or injures himself or herself in that person's house, even if the intruder was injured by the defensive actions of the householder.  This Bill has nothing to say on that subject.  The Bill, which the Leader insists is a Private Members' Bill in the name of Senator Morrissey and not a Government Bill, gives no indication of where the Government stands on that issue.  All we know is that it rejected Fine Gael's attempts to clarify the law and we can only assume it does not consider home defence a worthwhile issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Our Bill would have provided a full defence in criminal and civil law in cases where force is reasonably used by occupiers of dwellings to defend life or property against persons trespassing with criminal intent.  While this Bill has the same thrust, it fails to deal with the broad spectrum of issues at hand.  At this stage, a clear statement by the Tánaiste, who is present, would be helpful.  Does he not accept that the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill is sensible and reasonable and had the potential to deal effectively with this issue of concern to householders?</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The greatest problem with the Bill is that it allows for murder.  Fine Gael is not in favour of murder or of allowing people to make use of an unsubstantiated excuse for it.  We believe in home owners' rights to defend their homes.  Therefore, we will support this Bill but will seek to amend it on Committee Stage to correct what are patent lacunae in its provisions.  Proposing a Bill that is similar to, but not as carefully thought-out as, the Fine Gael Bill is a hypocritical exercise on the part of the Progressive Democrats.  Members of the Progressive Democrats do not like what we proposed because we got in before them.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">I welcome the opportunity to address the House on Senator Morrissey's Bill, the subject matter of which is one of great interest not only in the Oireachtas but in the country at large.  It is a subject I consider to be of the utmost importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Senators are aware of cases in which persons have entered a house or a property without adequate excuse and with criminal intent with the result that injuries or death have been caused.  Such cases have fuelled the debate whether the law as it stands strikes the right balance between the rights of the occupier and those of the trespasser.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">There is a genuinely and widely held belief that while the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 legislates adequately for circumstances where self-defence may be applied in most circumstances, it does not give sufficient protection to a person who finds intruders with criminal intent in his or her home.  It is my contention — no doubt, a similar view informed Senator Morrissey's proposal — that an attack in the home has unique characteristics, given the potential emotive nature of an encounter between an occupant in the home and an unwelcome intruder.  I share the understandable public concern regarding this matter and I have no doubt Senator Morrissey's motivation in introducing the Bill arises from a similar appreciation of that public concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Article 40.3.2° of the Constitution imposes a duty on the State to protect by its laws as best it may its citizens from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, to vindicate the person of every citizen.  It is important to note that this provision applies to all citizens, including those engaged in criminal activity.  The 1997 Act is the legislative method employed in this jurisdiction regarding assault and self-defence in respect of someone who fears he or she may be the victim of an assault.  This Act has served us well and continues to do so.  It was drafted following recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  The issue of self defence under the terms of the 1997 Act, which is only one element of the legislation, boils down to the question of reasonableness, that is, whether the force used by the defender was reasonable.  The difficulty is that there is no single answer to this question, with each set of circumstances differing from another.  The 1997 Act ensures that juries are given the option of rejecting a plea of legitimate self defence where they are satisfied it was unreasonable not to retreat.  It therefore preserves the principle of conflict avoidance in circumstances where that is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">It is not, however, always possible or even desirable to retreat in the context of an intruder entering the home.  There may be other family members present who need protection.  There may be valuable property one does not wish to abandon.  It simply may be that the understandable tension and stress of the incident renders the defender incapable of flight or of any movement.   In fact, there is the right to stand one's right in one's home.  If the home is inviolable under the Constitution, one has no right to cede the ground and render it violable to some other person.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Section 2(2) of Senator Morrissey's Bill addresses this issue.  It provides that the retreat provisions contained in section 20(4) of the 1997 Act, shall not apply where there is an intruder in the home or on the curtilage of the home and where the trespass is done for the purposes of committing a serious criminal offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">There are significant differences between the Bill under consideration here in the Seanad this evening and the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  The key differences are as follows.  The provisions of Senator Morrissey's Bill apply only to a person's dwelling and the curtilage of the dwelling while the 1997 Act applies to self defence in general, regardless of location.  The Bill, as I have said, removes the requirement to retreat as set out in section 20(4) of the 1997 Act.   Senator Morrissey's Bill provides a defence in criminal proceedings to specific circumstances relating to trespass and intent to commit an offence in a person's house or on the cartilage.  The Bill also provides a similar defence in relation to civil proceedings.   Finally, the provisions of Senator Morrissey's Bill apply to murder and manslaughter which is not the case with the 1997 Act, which is concerned merely with non fatal offences against the person.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Last June, in a debate in the Dáil on the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill, I expressed agreement with the sentiments behind the publication of Senator Morrissey's Bill at the time.  It was my view, however, that the Fine Gael Bill contained some deficiencies which are not to be found in Senator Morrissey's Bill.  The key differences between the Fine Gael Bill and Senator Morrissey's Bill are that the provisions in the former did not extend to the curtilage of the dwelling and the provisions cannot be used as a defence to the application of lethal force by a defender.  When the Government opposed that Bill in June it was pointed out that it contained no distinction between certain kinds of trespass.  It made no reference to criminal intent and there was no protection for accidental death.  To use Senator Morrissey's point, if somebody was pushed backwards and his or her head hit off the mantelpiece or a corner in the house, that was not covered by the Fine Gael Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Fine Gael Bill provided for a rebuttable presumption that any force used is reasonable while Senator Morrissey's Bill sets out the conditions for a defence in criminal proceedings.  It is my view and that of the Government that tonight's Bill is the more effective of the two proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">I was glad to see that Senator Morrissey's Bill includes the curtilage of the house as part of the home dwelling and provides a definition of the curtilage.  I remarked on the absence of such a provision in the debate last June on the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill because I believe it to be an essential element of any such legislation.  We cannot have one law ending at the hall door and another at the garage door or at the front gate, so to speak.  The Bill being considered here also contains a very important provision which provides protection from civil liability to the resident in cases of unlawful intrusion.  Our primary legislation in this area is the Occupiers Liability Act of 1995.  That Act reduces the extent of the occupiers' obligations to trespassers.  It provides that an occupier owes a duty not to injure a trespasser intentionally and not to act with reckless disregard.  The Act also provides that where a person enters onto a premises for the purpose of committing an offence, or while there commits an offence, the occupier is not liable for a breach of duty imposed generally on trespassers unless a court decides otherwise in the interests of justice.  Senator Morrissey's Bill puts the matter very succinctly.  In section 3 it states that in any civil proceedings for damages it shall be a defence for a defendant to establish that the Act took place in the dwelling or in the curtilage, that the injured party was trespassing in such a way as to give rise to a reasonable inference that such trespass or attempted trespass was for the purpose of committing a serious criminal offence and that the act alleged against the accused entailed the use of justifiable force within the meaning of section 18 of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  Fundamentally what is to be considered in the context of the Private Members' Bill which Senator Morrissey has brought before the Seanad this evening is the efficacy of the 1997 Act in dealing with the types of situations which arise from the incidents involving occupiers and intruders.  This House is only too well aware of such incidents, some of which have received a great deal of attention both in this jurisdiction and elsewhere in recent years.  Obviously, no situation involving assault could be described as normal but in the context of an assault in the home I believe regard must be had to the unique circumstances which prevail in a situation when an intruder is being dealt with in the place which we all have a right consider to be a place of safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">It is not only Senator Morrissey and I who regard an attack on the home as having characteristics which do not apply in other situations.  Since Senator Morrissey published his Bill in May of last year, at a date which preceded publication of the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill in the Dáil——</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_505">——the Law Reform Commission has since published a consultation paper on the subject of legitimate defence.  This publication was part of a series which is being undertaken by the Law Reform Commission into the law on homicide in this jurisdiction.  I ask Senator Cummins to note that the consultation paper on legitimate defence makes a clear distinction between the deployment of defence in connection with an attack on the home dwelling and the use of such defence in the context of an attack in other circumstances.  In one of its provisional recommendations the Law Reform Commission states that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_506">...a defender should not be required to retreat from an attack in their dwelling home even if they could do so with complete safety...dwelling house should be defined as including the curtilage or the area immediately surrounding the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Another point that Senator Cummins might take into account is that among the conclusions contained in the Law Reform Commission consultation paper was the view that it found the arguments in favour of the use of lethal force to defend the dwelling house persuasive.  This approach, it said, safeguards the individual's autonomy and has regard to the individual's inability to make split second decisions when confronted with an attacker in the home.  In other words the Law Reform Commission does not believe lethal force should be removed from the protection and sub-lethal force inserted.  It says there may be circumstances, in effect, where one uses lethal force and should be protected.  In relation to the argument that this approach is not justified on the lesser of two evils standard, the Law Reform Commission states specifically that this is open to dispute given that most individuals in such circumstances fear death or serious injury, whether this belief is reasonable or not.  The Law Reform Commission goes on to say that even if the defence cannot be justified on the traditional ground of protecting physical safety, it may be justifiable on the grounds of recognition of the home's importance to the defender's dignity, privacy and honour.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Senator Morrissey's Bill is concerned with the provisions of the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.  However fatal offences, murder and manslaughter, which can as we know arise in incidents of trespass, are considered in the context of other statutes.  In modern jurisprudence a guilty mind or <i>mens rea </i>is an element of most crimes.  The prosecution has to prove that an accused engaged in unlawful conduct.  It may also have to prove that he or she engaged in such conduct with a guilty mind.  For example in a charge of assault causing harm under the provisions of section 3 of the Non Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997, the prosecution would have to prove a guilty mind not only in respect of the assault but also in respect of the harm.  It would appear on the face of it that such a guilty mind and an intention to cause harm would not apply in the case of an intruder entering the family home with some kind of criminal intent.  In a recent judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to a case where a fatality occurred in the course of a burglary, the court said that a burglary was always an act of aggression.  Therefore it might be argued that any assault on such an intruder undoubtedly would be one without culpability on the part of the occupier and one in which no accusation of criminal intent could be possibly levelled at the occupier in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">This is where I believe we must be very careful and why I am of the opinion that the matters covered by this Bill require a considerable amount of analysis and consideration.  The provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1964 which deals with murder and manslaughter quite properly remain on the Statute Book.  We have to be sure we balance the protections that we give to homeowners in situations such as those I have outlined already with proper respect for the rule of law.   A legislative change such as the one proposed in this Bill cannot ever be a licence to kill.  My concern is that the emotive nature of an encounter with a trespasser or an intruder, with what might be perceived by the occupier to be a criminal intent, could, as I have said, have the effect of rendering a person incapable of properly assessing his or her response and a tragedy of serious proportions might then ensue.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">I also have concerns about situations which may not be as clear as the types of scenarios I have been discussing.  I am thinking of circumstance where the status of a person visiting a premises is unclear.  Perhaps someone who is considered to be an uninvited guest at a house for a social occasion or a situation where a caller to a house appears to be a trespasser but may in fact have a legitimate reason for being there.  It would be a serious miscarriage of justice were such a person to be injured and have no recourse to the civil law for damages.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">With regard to the Fine Gael Bill introduced in the other House, it excused anybody from any sub-lethal damage they did to anybody who was trespassing on their premises.</p>

It will also deal with the meaning of the use of force and will describe what is and is not a use of force and when a threat of force can be reasonable even though the actual use of force might not be.  It will also deal with justifiable use of force for protections of personal property and for prevention of crime.  It will set out grounds for defence and the scope of the legislation.  It will set out, similar to Senator Morrissey's Bill, where the provisions of this Bill apply, although not in every circumstances as provided in the Fine Gael Bill.  No civil liability shall apply to a person in respect of injury arising from his or her actions in relation to a trespasser whose has entered the dwelling or curtilage with criminal intent.

If one speaks to any practising lawyer in this town, he or she will tell one that the great advantage of the 1997 legislation, particularly in respect of assault and battery, was that it brought about a clear understanding of what the penalties were.  Up to that point we were simply winging it on case law.  In fairness to the then Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, she codified the law; she made it clear what the penalties were in respect of assault and battery, something which has not been done previously.</p>

We welcome that.   The Law Reform Commission's report states beyond doubt that this is an area in respect of which the law must be changed and that it needs to be changed by the introduction of legislation, which we attempted to introduce last year.

          <p eId="para_559">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am glad to be in the back row because I am missing all the bullets here.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I compliment Senator Morrissey on bringing this Bill forward and for the thought, effort and energy he has put into it.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend civil and criminal law to allow for the use of justifiable force in the face of an intruder who enters a person's home with criminal intent, without having to show whether he or she took the opportunity to retreat in the face of that intruder.  It is a very sensitive and emotional issue, but most of us are of the view that the balance must be struck in favour of the house owner.  Equally, we must be careful to ensure the laws we enact are proportionate.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Burglaries are a feature of all states and we are no different to that.  Burglaries in Ireland have increased dramatically over the years.  We are told that there is now an average of 3.5 burglaries per hour in Ireland and a property is robbed every 15 minutes.  Each year, 30,000 burglaries occur, of which 21,000 occur in ordinary households.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_564">People have been murdered while asleep in their homes and children have been terrified, with traumatic psychological consequences.  That emphasises the seriousness of the situation and is the reason we need to develop our legislation to protect those people.  I compliment Senator Morrissey for doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Almost 60 home owners will be burgled every day.  Most of us know people who have experienced the trauma of having to deal with the burglary of their homes.  Between 2004 and 2005, approximately €59 million was stolen from people's homes, which is something we need to deal with.  When the influential Law Reform Commission deliberated on the issue, it also shifted the balance in favour of the citizen.  It stated that someone defending his or her home should no longer be expected to retreat in the face of attack.  The law-abiding members of the public, who find themselves in these terrifying situations through no fault of their own deserve whatever we legislators can provide to protect them in their time of need.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">I know this is an emotional statement, but I find it difficult to consider giving any rights to an individual who breaks into a person's home, terrifies the person's family and expects the law of the land to allow him the same rights as the people he is terrifying.  I know that the Minister must protect all citizens equally in law, but it is hard to take when we must legislate for individuals such as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Before I came to the House, a colleague of mine was talking to me about a relation of his whose business was robbed.  He caught up with the guy who robbed it, who told him to do his best.  He said that he may go to jail, but that he would be out in six months and he would deal with my colleague's relation.  We do not want a battlefield scenario in which tit for tat actions occur.  We must always be mindful of how we legislate in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I am concerned about old and vulnerable people in isolated areas.  The stress and fear of hearing someone enter the home must be something to behold.  The sense of isolation and fear must be unbelievable.  These vulnerable individuals could easily die of a heart attack without the intruder ever laying a hand on them.  If someone rushes to confront an intruder who then fell, hit his head and died, that person could be convicted of murder under the current legislation.  That is outrageous.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">There was a time when if I heard someone in my house, I would go downstairs to confront the individual with or without a weapon, but not anymore.  Nowadays, we are dealing with a different type of intruder, one who is filled with drugs and who has long since forgotten the idea of fear.  He could carry a knife or some other weapon and he might think nothing of hitting or killing the occupier.  I would do what the Garda Síochána suggests we should do, which is take the family into one room and make as much noise and turn on as many lights as possible so that the intruder or intruders might be frightened.  However, I am not sure if intruders on drugs would be frightened and take flight.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The underlying element to all this is the drugs problem.  Without doubt, they are a major contributor to the number of robberies that take place.  It is a debate for another forum, but it impacts on much of the legislation that comes through the House.  I read in a newspaper last week that two out of five youngsters between the ages of 12 and 15 had experienced or dabbled in drugs of one kind or another.  We see what we are up against.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The Garda Síochána has a major role to play in this.  It is an important feature of good policing to have a garda in the community.  The reserve force will play a major part in stepping into the breach.  From my 16 years' experience on Dublin City Council, the community garda was a person with whom members of the community could always deal.  He was the person people could go to with their problems.  Community gardaí were very important for those areas in which they worked.  The unfortunate thing is that they were never left long enough in the role.  They either did not like their job or they got promoted and moved along as there was no real promotion within the community garda structure.  The Minister mentioned that he was looking at the idea of giving status within the force to community garda.  If community gardaí can be retained in a place where they can develop real relationships with communities and the organisations within them, we can kill off the potential for the existence of individuals that find their way into people's homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">I compliment Senator Morrissey on bringing this Bill before the House.  I support anything that endeavours to protect vulnerable people in society.  If this is the way forward, I welcome that.</p>

        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_366" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_573">I support the tenor of the Bill and compliment Senators Morrissey and Brennan on presenting it to the House.  We are fortunate that a number of Private Members' Bills have come before the House in recent times.  This is a tribute to Members and the work they put into preparing Bills on matters of import.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I was watching the debate on the monitor and noticed how Opposition Members were getting exercised about what goes on in the other House.  The work that goes on in the Dáil should stay there and should not be debated here.  There is no need for that.  What we do stands on its merits.  In general, courtesy is shown to us and I have not heard any great criticism in the lower House of what goes on here.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The Bill is important for many reasons.  Senator Morrissey outlined the high profile case which underlines many aspects of it and alluded to the sad consequences for all parties involved in that case, which was a tragedy for those involved, for the area and for the family that lost a father.  It is important that the law recognises the right of people to take reasonable and proportionate defensive measures for themselves and their families.  However, if people overreact, they must be held to account.  Among a small section of the community there is total disregard for the rights of other people, their property, their lives and safety.  When I was growing up it was traditionally held that a man's home was his castle and that if anybody trespassed with malicious intent or hit somebody on his own property, it was far more serious than if it happened in public areas.  There is much common sense to that approach.  As a consequence, I welcome much that is in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The Minister said the Government intends bringing forward more comprehensive legislation that will embrace these issues and he should be complimented on that.  It is easy for the Opposition to be critical when it does not have to deliver anything other than criticism.  Opposition Members are like hurlers on the ditch and their comments are generally retrospective.  The benefit of hindsight is great.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Senator Kett alluded to and complimented Senator Morrissey on a particular aspect of the Bill, namely, that its provisions would also be taken into account in civil cases.  This is relevant considering how litigious society has become.  For example, in a case in the United States, an intruder getting through a skylight injured himself and subsequently brought a multi-million dollar claim against the owners of the property for compensation.  This is a ludicrous situation.  If a person perpetrates a crime on others, he or she must accept the consequences may be severe.  The law should not be on the side of the perpetrator in civil cases no more than it should be in a criminal case.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">I am sure that all sides of the House subscribe to the sentiments expressed in the Bill.  The message must be made clear that people have rights.  Prudence will dictate that people do not overreact.  People realise that where a criminal element is involved an overreaction could have severe consequences.  Reaction must be proportionate.  The legislation must include provision that where a crime has been committed and the criminal subsequently finds himself before the courts, the victim's rights will be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I compliment Senators Morrissey and Brennan on the Bill.  It is a milestone for the Seanad to have a Bill that will not be opposed in the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_367">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_580">I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to say a few words on the legislation.  I am glad this discussion is taking place some months after a case that was a major media event.  I compliment Senators Morrissey and Brennan on bringing forward the Bill.  It is useful to have debate on the issue.  Having looked at the proposed Government Bill, I prefer the definitions in it on first reading.  However, the issue now is the need to debate the subject and come to a conclusion on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Speaking as somebody who has been burgled on many occasions, I always felt clear about what the law was.  I believed that in defence of myself or my family, I would be entitled to use appropriate or enough force.  Without going into the details of the recent highlighted case, I think the court saw it as, perhaps, two assaults and that this is what led to some confusion about the issue.  In terms of rights, people have a right to defend themselves and their property.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I was at a meeting and did not hear the presentation on this Bill, but I think the definition in the Bill providing "that the act or acts alleged took place in or in the curtilage of a dwelling" is very loose.  I agree we must have the definition, but it is not the defence I would want.  The defence outlined in the meaning of the use of force in the proposed heads of Bill is closer to what I would like in terms of getting the balance between rights, the right to life and the right to protection of property.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">People have an absolute right to protect themselves and their families.  They also have a right to protect their property using appropriate and reasonable force.  We need to get away from the extremes of both points of view.  Some people say if somebody comes towards them, they will shoot, while other people feel no force at all should be used.  In terms of the debate on the issue, people should be reassured that under the current legislation they are not proscribed from defending themselves.  Rather, it may be that the burden of proof needs to be lessened.  This is what I believe the Minister is trying to do in the proposed heads of Bill he has circulated.  I would welcome that and believe it will assure people.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Having been burgled, even while in my house, and having discussed the issue with legal people afterwards, I am aware of the view that a person can use appropriate force to repel somebody from entering his house, on the basis of defence of home and homestead.  Similarly, in rural Ireland where every house once had a shotgun, the rural hob lawyer held that if a person shot someone facing him, there was a possibility of mounting a defence, but if one shot someone in the back or when he or she was running away, a defence would not be so possible.  These are the kind of guidelines we grew up with and people understood they could appropriately repel somebody making a forcible entry into their property and that they could use the defence that they were being attacked and felt their life was at risk.  The phrase in the Minister's proposed heads of Bill, that the person "threatens violence", which while probably hard to prove, gives an example of what is involved here.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The defence is being in fear of one's life.  In the high profile case mentioned, my view is that it was the fact the person was completely terrorised by what might happen to him that drove him to take a life.  I will not go into the rights and wrongs of that situation.  No doubt the psychological state of that person at that time must be understood, and anybody who has ever experienced a sense of violation — in my own case, even just minor burglaries — would understand that it is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Sometimes people living on their own who go through such ordeals do not recover.  Recently I was in a nursing home where somebody told me the reason she was there was that she had been burgled and could not sleep easy in her home.  I listened on the radio during the week to another person in her late 70s on a related topic and she had moved from the house in which she had lived all her life into a nearby town out of fear of being on her own because she had been burgled.  The Minister can see what we are getting at here.  We must give people reassurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The Bill is timely and useful.  The defence of life or property is what the Bill sets out to do, and I support that.  People should be entitled to take whatever measures are necessary.  The way that is being done in the Minister's proposal is a cleaner and more acceptable one, and to that extent, the people would want to know that we are dealing with this issue in a way that balances all the rights of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I have raised this question with civil liberties groups.  I have asked them to articulate clearly what they believe is the law and what it should be, and what are the rights.  Although people can huff and puff, when it comes down to it there are not that many differences when they speak of what they want to do and it is a matter of finding the means.  The Bill is the start of the process and perhaps the Minister's proposal is the finish of it.  I welcome the discussion and welcome the opportunity to speak to it.  I wish the Government well in bringing forward its proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_592">Fine Gael might be talking about it, but they did not produce anything.  Senator Cummins' arguments were fine, but I was concerned at the rather childish behaviour of another Senator on his party's benches, particularly where the views of people who have spent time and effort in compiling and bringing forward a Bill were derided, laughed at and compared to those of his five year old son.  We do not go on like that here and I found that quite demeaning.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">This is an issue, whether we like it or not, that is in every householder's mind throughout this country.  I live alone and reading it has frightened the wits out of me.  There is a strong case to be made for many of the points which are in the Bill, and I read the Minister's speech carefully too.  It is clear that this is part of an ongoing debate on defence of one's property and of one's body and rights.  In that debate, this Bill is playing a useful role.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I note the Minister stated that when he debated the Fine Gael Bill in the other House, he found parts of it proper and right and would seek to implement them at some future date in a Bill of his own.  That was interesting and accommodating of him.  I note that he pointed up, in particular, the areas where he found that Bill wanting, as I am sure some of the areas of this one may well be wanting, or perhaps scant, in consideration.  This Bill is part of that body of work which has been built up on this important topic.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">I found myself very torn on the case of the man in the west which got significant coverage some months ago.  Of course one felt sorry for the man who was absolutely petrified at what was happening to him, but one does not follow a person down a lane and shoot in the back.  I would take grave exception to that, which is a consequence of what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">This is a good Bill.  This is a good Seanad in which there have been many Private Members' Bills brought forward and accepted.  We are meant to be a scrutinising, reviewing and an innovative Chamber, and this is innovation on the part of Members who decided to do something about a relevant issue which is dominant in most people's minds.  It is completely unnecessary to deride anyone in this Chamber for having the intelligence to bring forward a Bill.  I am happy my colleagues have brought forward the Bill and that the Government has seen fit to give it due consideration.  No doubt many of the points in it will make their way into a more comprehensive Bill which the Minister will bring forward in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Burglaries, break-ins and ravages are not new crimes.  I would imagine they are as old as time, but the wish to defend one's property and be in command of where one lives, what one owns and where one spends one's time is also as old as time, and is a primitive urge.  That people feel like that should be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">While we are in favour of and welcome the Bill, I do not know what will be the next move with it.  I am glad to be part of a Government team in this House which has brought the Bill forward.  I hope the Minister will follow up on his faith in it and that his faith will find evidence in the provisions of the Bill he brings forwards.</p>

          <p eId="para_601">——that greeted this initiative which I found difficult to reconcile with the dignity of this House.  There is no such thing as political patents on good ideas.  Good ideas, even when put forward first by a particular politician or party, do not belong exclusively then to that person or party.  If they are good ideas they will gather support from many different sources and of course if they are bad ones, they will be abandoned even by the people who put them forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">It is a good principle that Members of this House, both on the Government and Opposition side, are free to put forward legislative proposals.  It is important to protect that principle and people should not be derided for so doing even if, as in this case, the person putting the Bill forward is a member of the same party as the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The background to this matter was the tragic Nally affair.  People living alone, especially in the countryside, are or may feel particularly vulnerable.  The affair had all the ingredients — a farmer, living in isolation, land, a member of the Traveller community.  That there may have been unreasonable provocation and intimidation does not justify overreaction, but this legislation and the Minister's draft heads of a Bill illustrate how extraordinarily difficult it is to cover all the possible circumstances in an area of this kind where there are unlikely to be outside witnesses or third parties.  They also demonstrate how difficult it is, even when the law is settled, for judges to arrive at the right, balanced conclusion on the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I am glad the Minister said in his response that juries are given the option of rejecting a plea of legitimate defence where they are satisfied it was unreasonable not to retreat.  This might not apply in all circumstances but, as the Minister said, it preserves the principle of conflict avoidance in circumstances where that is possible.  Much though we may admire those who take defence into their own hands, be it in the home or during a bank raid, it is better to avoid conflict in most cases, if possible.  We should not give any impression otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I accept the point that it is justified for people to engage in self-defence.  How many people do we know who secretly keep a poker behind their bedroom or kitchen doors or, in certain circumstances, a shotgun?  If one brings down a poker on the head of an intruder, one does not intend to kill him, but there is a slight risk that it will be the effect.  Intruders should be perfectly clear that they are not entering a harm-free zone and they may get injured, or worse.  Perhaps they should contemplate this before they intrude in the first place.  The law should not be over-protective of intruders although it must reprove any excessive or gratuitous use of force.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">This issue requires more detailed legislation, such as the legislation the Minister is proposing.  I appreciate that we are not discussing primarily the heads of the Minister's Bill but I will refer to one point.  Under head four, there is no defence if the person in question knows the force is used against a member of An Garda Síochána acting in the course of his or her duty, or a person assisting such a member.  This should apply to all public officials.  In this regard, one should bear in mind the slightly comic example of the advertisements showing a television licence inspector appearing in a person's yard.  Is the inspector not entitled to protection also?</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Circumstances involving certain public officials, such as agricultural inspectors, entering one's land can be emotionally fraught and therefore legislation should be very clear as to when public officials may enter property legitimately.  While welcoming Senator Morrissey's initiative, I take the Minister's central point that very detailed and carefully drafted legislation is required.  Even then, much discretion will have to be exercised by judges, who will have to make fine judgments on the circumstances of particular cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">I very much welcome this discussion because it is important to everyone.</p>

          <p eId="para_619">It provides no protection in the case of manslaughter.  In the course of this debate we have seen that there are cases where the curtilage of a person's house should be taken into account.  The Law Reform Commission's report made a strong case for this and highlighted a pointed difference between self-defence in general and self-defence by a person on his own property.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Consider the split-second decisions people make during an intrusion.  If an intruder entered one's house and there were an altercation resulting in his death, although one did not intend to kill him, the fact that the intruder was on one's property with criminal intent should entitle one to invoke some law in one's defence.  This is what we are trying to do.  If one sees somebody outside one's front door breaking into one's car, for example, one should be entitled to use some form of self-defence.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. B. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_638">Molaim an Bille um an Ghníomhaireacht Chúltaca Ola Náisiúnta don Teach.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill to the House.  This Bill, which was initiated in the Dáil in June 2006, is an important part of the Government's energy agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The Government's Green Paper on energy policy, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, has set out the framework for national energy policy for the medium to long term.  The policy proposals to be set out in the forthcoming White Paper will be informed by projections in respect of growth in energy demand and related economic and demographic trends, as well as the requirements to ensure sustainability and security of energy supplies and fuel diversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">In addition to work under way on the development of the Green Paper on energy policy as a White Paper, the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 was enacted at the end of December.  The Act has expanded the functions of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, the independent statutory body responsible for regulating and overseeing the liberalisation of Ireland's electricity and natural gas sectors.  Earlier this afternoon, this House considered the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Single Electricity Market) Bill 2006 and is due to consider Report and Final Stages of this Bill tomorrow.  This Bill will be an important step in the delivery of the single electricity market that will contribute to a more secure and cost efficient service for all customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">A detailed explanatory memorandum has been published that provides a synopsis of the provisions of this Bill as initiated.  While the Bill has undergone some changes in the course of its passage through the Dáil, these changes have not been fundamental.  Amendments to the Bill by Dáil Éireann have resulted in the insertion of three new sections — sections 49, 57 and 62 — which were introduced with the objective of strengthening the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Bill has a number of strands which I will outline.  It will establish the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, as a stand alone non-commercial State body under the aegis of the Department with responsibility for the maintenance of strategic supplies of oil in line with the State's oil stockholding obligations to the European Union and the International Energy Agency, IEA.  It will transfer the Irish National Petroleum Corporation's shareholding in the National Oil Reserves Agency to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and will provide for the continued operation of the agency as a private limited company under the Companies Acts.  It will provide for the continued operation of a variable levy on disposals of petroleum products to be imposed on oil companies and oil consumers.  Such a levy has operated since 1995 under the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oils) Regulations 1995.  It will make provision for the furnishing to the Minister of regular returns in respect of oil purchases, sales, consumption, imports and exports by oil companies, oil consumers and the National Oil Reserves Agency and will provide for monitoring of compliance with its provisions and the application of penalties in the event of non-compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Before discussing the detailed provisions of the Bill, I wish to outline the background to the National Oil Reserves Agency, which was set up in 1995 as a subsidiary of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.  Arising from its membership of the European Union and the International Energy Agency, Ireland has obligations to maintain levels of national oil stocks.  At present, it must maintain 90 days of previous year consumption under the EU system and 90 days of previous year net imports under the IEA system.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Prior to 1995, the oil companies in Ireland were obliged to meet a substantial portion of these oil stockholding obligations.  This system proved unsatisfactory and, under the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oil) Regulations 1995, responsibility for the maintenance of strategic stockholding was vested in the National Oil Reserves Agency.  For pragmatic reasons, the agency was established as a subsidiary of the INPC.  Since 1995 NORA has acted as the agent of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with the function of arranging for the holding of strategic oil stocks at a level determined, at least annually, by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The period since 1995 has coincided with the emergence of the Celtic tiger and the phenomenal increase in the country's oil consumption.  This increase has impacted on the volumes of strategic stocks required to meet the 90 days obligation of the IEA and the EU.  On 1 December 2006 Ireland's oil stock reserves were estimated at 129 days, well in excess of the 90 days obligation.  With the disposal of the Bantry oil terminal and the Whitegate refinery in July 2001, NORA is the sole remaining subsidiary of the INPC.  The INPC has no operational capacity and its current activities are limited to its rights and obligations arising from the sale and purchase agreement attaching to the 2001 transaction and meeting requirements under company law arising from its role as parent company to NORA.  It is against this background that the Government agreed the agency should be established as an independent body under the aegis of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, continuing to have responsibility for the maintenance of emergency oil reserves.  The Bill provides that the INPC shareholding in NORA will be transferred to the Minister and the agency will continue to operate as a private limited company under the Companies Acts.  On enactment of the Bill, therefore, NORA will no longer be a subsidiary of the INPC.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I will refer to the main provisions of the legislation in more detail.  Part 2 provides for the transfer to the Minister of the share owned by the INPC in NORA.  By means of a ministerial order, a share transfer day will be appointed as the day on which the INPC transfers the share owned by it in NORA to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Part 3, which includes sections 7 to 31, inclusive, provides for the continuation of the agency as a limited company subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts.  Provision is also made for wide-ranging corporate governance provisions.  The principal functions and powers of NORA are set out in section 8.  These include the maintenance of oil stocks, the provision of advice to the Minister on matters relating to the holding of oil stocks, the collection of a levy on petroleum products and the provision of advisory and technical assistance.  The agency will have powers to acquire, hold, store, import, export, transport and exchange oil and it will also have powers to construct, acquire, maintain, operate and develop works, plant, storage tanks and pipelines for holding and transporting oil stocks.  These provisions are necessary for the ongoing successful implementation by NORA of its oil stockholding responsibilities.  Part 3 also makes provision for a company memorandum and articles of association, for alterations thereto and for the appointment of a board of directors of six persons.  Provisions have been included in regard to the submission of strategy statements by the agency to the Minister, the drawing up of a code of conduct by the agency, the appointment of a chief executive by the directors, the setting out of CEO functions and the appointment of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Since its establishment in 1995 the agency has been funded by a combination of a levy on oil companies and oil consumers on disposals of petroleum products and by commercial borrowings from financial institutions. It is proposed that this situation will continue.  The legislative proposals regarding borrowing by NORA, set out in sections 26 and 27, propose an aggregate borrowing threshold of €1 billion, a figure which takes account of sustained high oil prices of recent years.  NORA avails of commercial borrowings to fund the purchase of oil.  Obligations regarding the submission of annual reports and accounts by the agency are provided for in sections 28 and 29.  Section 31 provides that the NORA CEO may be examined by committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas on expenditure by the agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Part 4 sets out provisions relating to the maintenance of oil stocks by the agency.  As a member of the IEA, Ireland is required to maintain emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports in the previous year.  The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption.  Section 32 provides that the agency shall maintain a level of oil stocks to comply with Ireland's stockholding obligations, or such higher level as the Minister may specify.  Ireland meets its EU and IEA obligations through a combination of wholly owned stocks held in Ireland by NORA and industry-major oil consumers; wholly owned stocks held by NORA in other EU member states under cover of bilateral agreements; and oil stock "tickets" where NORA has entered into short-term commercial contracts — either in Ireland or in EU member states where a bilateral oil stockholding agreement has been concluded — with an option to purchase, in emergency circumstances, during the period of the contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Sections 32 and 33 provide that NORA may enter into contracts with third parties to hold stocks on its behalf either within the State or outside the State in accordance with a bilateral agreement.  The facility to hold stocks under cover of bilateral agreements stems from EU stockholding legislation.  A member state may hold stocks in the territory of another member state, subject to a bilateral oil stockholding agreement being in place between the respective states.  Under such agreements, the host country guarantees that it will not oppose the transfer of the oil in question to Ireland in the event of an emergency.  Section 34 obliges the Minister to decide what volumes of oil stocks are to be maintained to meet international obligations and requires that the Minister must keep the agency informed as to the volume of oil stocks it must maintain.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Section 35 provides for the issue of ministerial directions authorising the agency to release oil stocks in, for example, a case of major interruption in oil supplies.  There would be no question of Ireland or any other oil consuming country attempting to deal on its own with such an interruption.  If such a crisis were to occur, the response, including the release of emergency stocks and the identification of alternative sources of supplies, would take place primarily within the framework of the formal emergency regime developed and maintained by the IEA.  This framework acknowledges that the management of major oil supply disruptions requires an international response.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Part 5 outlines provisions relating to the NORA levy on disposals of petroleum products.  One of the key strands of the legislation is to provide for the continued operation of a variable levy on disposals of petroleum products by oil companies and oil consumers.  The levy, which funds the holding and storage of oil and other operating expenses of the agency, is charged at the rate of 0.476 cent per litre on sales of petroleum products.  It is applied to oil companies that use petrol, kerosene, gasoil and fuel oil for their own consumption and-or sales of these products within the State.  The levy has remained unchanged since 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Section 37 provides that expenses of the National Oil Reserves Agency, which are defined under section 36, will continue to be funded by the monthly levy on oil disposals.  The National Oil Reserves Agency will continue to administer and collect the levy.  The agency will also continue to be funded by borrowings from financial institutions towards the purchase of National Oil Reserves Agency owned oil stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Section 38 provides for exemptions from the levy.  At present oil consumer companies that hold in excess of 55 days reserves based on their previous year's consumption may claim an exemption from payment of levy.  It is a commercial decision for each oil consumer as to whether it avails of the exemption or pays the levy.  In order to avail of the exemption, an oil consumer will require dedicated tankage for oil storage over and above its normal operational requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Section 38(2), as passed by Dáil Éireann, provides that an oil consumer may claim exemption from levy on the basis of a contract between an oil consumer and a third party to hold oil owned by the oil consumer for the purpose of the consumer claiming an exemption from levy.  The Minister may consider a claim for exemption from levy provided that, before the contract was entered into, the contract proposals were submitted to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">While it is accepted that oil consumers will generally have adequate storage facilities to allow them claim an exemption from levy, nevertheless it is acknowledged that storage problems may arise from time to time where, for example, a company must temporarily decommission storage tanks in order to carry out necessary or unanticipated refurbishment works.  Therefore, section 38 facilitates oil consumers who find themselves in this situation and also strengthens the Minister's powers in regard to the assessment of applications by oil consumers for exemption from levy payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Section 39 provides for the issue of monthly notifications to the agency by the Minister in regard to the volumes of petroleum products disposed of by each oil company and oil consumer in the preceding month.  Volume assessments will be based on information provided by the companies or, in the absence of information being provided by a company, the Department will provide an estimate.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Section 40 provides for calculation by the Minister of the amount of levy payable by each oil company and oil consumer and for notifications of each company's liability to the agency.  The levy charged will be based on disposals during each month and the rate of levy as prescribed by ministerial regulations.  The Department notifies the agency of the relevant levy amounts payable by each company and the agency invoices the companies accordingly under section 41.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Section 41 provides that monthly notices be provided by the National Oil Reserves Agency to oil companies and oil consumers advising them as to the volumes of petroleum products disposed of, the rate of the levy, the amount of the levy due, the date by which the levy should be paid and any exemptions from levy payment.  Section 42 provides for the charging of interest on levy not received by due date, while section 43 provides for the recovery by the agency, through the courts, of unpaid levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">Section 44 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister relating to the levy.  Regulations may be made in regard to a range of matters, including the rate of levy to be charged, the volume of products to be held by an oil consumer in order to claim an exemption from levy, the keeping of records by oil companies and oil consumers, the times at which levy payment becomes due and the rate of interest on unpaid levy.  The section provides that if the prescribed rate of levy is varied, the new rate of levy will take effect three months after the making of a ministerial order.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Part 6, which encompasses sections 45 to 51, relates to enforcement provisions.  Provisions are proposed to provide for inspection and monitoring of the premises of oil companies and major oil consumers.  These provisions include the appointment of authorised officers, the powers of authorised officers and the issue of search warrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Section 49, as passed by Dáil Éireann, obliges authorised officers to report certain matters.  The section provides that an authorised officer who, while in the course of an audit of an oil company or an oil consumer or while operating under a search warrant, forms the opinion that an activity is being carried out at a premises which is either not in compliance with a regulatory provision or the officer considers that there is a risk to the health and safety of the employees is obliged to report the matter to the appropriate authority.  Examples of "appropriate authority" include the Garda Síochána, the Health and Safety Authority, the local authority and the Revenue Commissioners.  A regulatory provision includes any provision made under legislation concerning the protection of employees, the protection of the environment or the regulation of planning and development.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The offences provision under section 50 provides, <i> inter alia</i>, that a person is guilty of an offence if he or she obstructs an authorised officer in the exercise of a power conferred under section 47; fails to comply with a direction of an authorised officer under section 47(1)(<i>c</i>) or (<i>e</i>); fails to comply with section 62 (4)(<i>b</i>); alters records that the person has been required to produce; gives false information to an authorised officer; or impersonates an authorised officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Part 7 provides for amendments to relevant legislation and for revocation of the 1995 regulations.  Sections 52 to 54, inclusive, provide for amendments to sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Act 2001 to allow the transfer of the assets of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation to the National Oil Reserves Agency; and release of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation from its obligation to repay to the Minister any moneys that might be paid out by the INPC under the provisions of the ministerial guarantee pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement relating to the 2001 sale of Whitegate refinery and the Bantry terminal; and the alteration of the memorandum and articles of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation to reflect the provisions of the National Oil Reserves Agency legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Section 55 provides for an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act to provide that NORA will come within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act.  Section 56 revokes the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oils) Regulations 1995 as the provisions of these regulations will become redundant after the Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Part 8 provides for miscellaneous provisions relating to the making of ministerial regulations and orders, the prosecution of offences, penalties and the giving of notices.  Section 57, which was agreed on Report Stage in Dáil Éireann, will allow regulations to be made under the National Oil Reserves Agency Act to give effect to amending legislation of the European Communities in so far as such legislation relates to oil stockholding.  The absence of this type of provision in the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill would require an amendment to the National Oil Reserves Agency Act in order to give effect to any future European Union legislation relating to oil stockholding.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Ireland's obligations to the European Union and the International Energy Agency require the provision of monthly returns relating to oil imports, exports and consumption, together with details of oil stocks held by the National Oil Reserves Agency.  These returns allow the EU and the International Energy Agency to monitor both oil usage and member countries' compliance with oil stockholding obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Section 59 provides that the Minister may make regulations requiring oil companies and oil consumers to make written returns within specific timeframes.  The proposals in regard to data provision do not include obligations on companies over and above obligations currently imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">I draw the attention of Senators to section 62, as agreed on Report Stage in the Dáil.  This section relates to bilateral oil stocks held in the State on behalf of another member state and to oil stocks also held in the State on the National Oil Reserves Agency's behalf.  The provision sets out criteria to be applied in regard to applications to the Minister to hold oil stocks in the State on behalf of another member state.  Oil companies and oil consumers will be obliged to submit contract proposals to the Minister in advance of entering into any contract arrangement.  The definition of "contract proposals" provides clarity in regard to the information to be submitted by companies to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">In order to ensure that the approval of bilateral contracts should not weaken Ireland's stockholding position, subsection (2) provides that the Minister, before deciding on a bilateral stockholding proposal, will have regard to the level of Ireland's national oil reserves and the availability of adequate stockholding facilities in the State for the purposes of meeting the State's stockholding obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">With regard to contracts between NORA and oil companies to store oil in the State on the agency's behalf, the section provides that such oil may not be drawn upon or replenished without the prior consent of the agency.  The House will note that an offence provision has been created under section 50 of the Bill whereby it will be an offence if a person draws upon or replenishes stocks of the National Oil Reserves Agency without its prior consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The objective of strengthening the Minister's position in regard to the approval of bilateral stockholding contracts and of NORA's position in regard to the holding of stocks in the State on its behalf, has been met through the amendment of the Bill to include this provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">On a general note, I hope the foregoing gives Senators a reasonable summary of the policies underpinning the Bill.  The Minister is confident that the provisions of the Bill will have benefits for Ireland in terms of affording maximum protection in the event of a significant oil supply disruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy John Browne, will be glad to provide any further information required by Senators to facilitate the early enactment of the Bill.  I hope the Bill will be progressed into law at the earliest opportunity.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_401">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_675">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House.  I will deputise for Senator Finucane who cannot be here.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Fine Gael welcomes this Bill.  However, we note it was originally mooted for October 2004.  It ironic to have an energy Bill which is already three years behind schedule.  The Bill seeks to establish the National Oil Reserves Agency as a stand alone non-commercial State body under the aegis of the Minister with responsibility for the maintenance of strategic supplies of oil in line with the State's oil stockholding obligations to the EU and the International Energy Agency.  It also seeks to transfer the Irish National Petroleum Corporation shareholding in NORA to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; to provide for a variable levy on disposals of petroleum products to be imposed on oil companies and oil consumers; to make provision for the furnishing to the Minister of regular returns regarding oil purchases, sales, consumption, imports and exports by oil companies, oil consumers and NORA; to provide for monitoring of compliance with provisions for the application of penalties in the event of failure by oil companies and oil consumers to comply with provisions; and to revoke the European Communities (Minimum Stocks of Petroleum Oils) Regulations 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">This is a structural Bill designed to put the National Oil Reserves Agency on a sound footing.  Fine Gael has no problem with the Bill itself.  However, as with the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 it is astounding in the midst of a serious energy crisis that we are faced with such a dearth of meaningful proposals from the Government in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">At present, Ireland fulfils its EU commitments to the holding by NORA of up to 108 days of oil reserves.  The Minister of State mentioned 129 days in his speech.  While this is as it should be, it should be noted only 38 days supply is wholly owned by NORA.  It might be worth considering increasing the share owned by NORA in the event of a major international emergency.  We are a rich nation but we are very vulnerable when it comes to oil and fuel.  It is important that we can afford to improve the mix in order that we are less reliant on industry-held stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Bio-fuels have the potential to provide major benefits to our farmers, environment and economy.  I am extremely annoyed and angry with the Government, not because of the closure of the sugar beet industry, which I feel was inevitable but which could have been kept operational for at least one more year, but because the Government let down everyone badly by failing to develop the sugar beet industry into a bio-fuel industry.  It is clear this could have been done and that we are vulnerable as an island nation with no natural oil reserves.  We failed to develop this area, even though special funding was available from the EU towards such activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Many European states began the process of kick-starting the bio-fuel industry by using set-aside land for the growing of bio-fuel crops.  It is interesting to note that in the US, President Bush and the Republicans now take seriously climate change.  This presents a unique opportunity for us.  If I am correct, approximately 20 million tonnes of maize are exported from the US at present and it is felt this will stop if the US further develops its bio-fuel industry.  This will present an opportunity for us.  We must take stock of what is happening not only here and in Europe but also consider the impact of the US example and the opportunities it will present to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Irish agricultural land offers a huge potential to develop alternative energy crops.  At present, the greatest potential for Irish crops in this industry lies in the development of bio-diesel and bioethanol not least because production is already under way, albeit on a small scale.  We must focus on developing this area as a priority.  The immediate focus must be on developing the process of fuel blending.  Essentially, this involves blending standard motoring diesel with rapeseed oil to produce bio-diesel and petrol with bioethanol.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">To be fair to the Government, the smoking ban was a major success as was the plastic bag tax because they were implemented throughout the country.  We can discuss bio-fuel until we are blue in the face, but until every petrol station has bio-fuel readily available, consumers will not be able to switch.  This is where we can take a leading role.  We can follow on from the example of the smoking ban and the plastic bag tax where the Government was successful.  I urge the Minister of State to seriously consider this.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Included in the Fine Gael proposals in this area are the removal of all excise duties on bio-fuels produced from renewable energy crops and the establishment of grants for producer groups which would consist of up to 50% of the cost of establishing the group, to a maximum of €300,000 per group.  We must have a public competition for the establishment and operation of a number of bio-fuel processing plants strategically located in a selected number of locations.  We would require capital start-up grants for these processing plants which would enable them to become established and begin viable processing operations.  We would also require greater links with international bio-fuel processors and fuel suppliers and the relevant Departments, particularly the Departments of Transport and Agriculture and Food.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Fine Gael recently launched a policy document, Energy for the Future.  This includes proposals for the reform of the VRT system, the necessity for blended fuel and the requirement for all public transport vehicles and public service vehicles to convert where practical and feasible to forms of bio-fuels.  The Taoiseach's recent announcement was welcome but much more remains to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Fine Gael believes if the correct steps are taken now we can deliver real change in the short term through lower carbon dioxide emissions and in the long term by reaching a generation capacity of 33% of our electricity needs within 20 years.  We cannot and must not concentrate on long-term 20 or 50 year targets to the detriment of immediate action to reduce CO2 levels now.  It has become increasingly evident that apart from higher oil and energy costs, this country is particularly vulnerable when it comes to storage facilities for oil or gas.  Hence, the recent need to introduce the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill without detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Regardless of continued political instability in energy producing countries such as those in the Middle East, the Government should take on board the Fine Gael energy policy and incorporate it in the national plan.  This would put in place energy conservation such as vehicle labelling, development of bio-fuels, home heat conservation through insulation, the use of alternatives, a major plan to develop the alternative energy industry and the necessary back-up to guarantee security of supply.  Such a move would not only conserve and replace energy and develop the energy sector but would also draw public attention to the necessity of taking such steps involving both industrial and domestic customers who rely heavily on reliable energy sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">I hope to obtain planning permission shortly to build my own house.  I am keenly aware of the various energy sources available.  What comes across loud and clear is the need to insulate the house properly in the first place.  We can speak about energy this evening, but unless we have in place systems and standards to ensure houses are properly insulated, we will draw on more and more energy.  The Government has failed miserably in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">When I was canvassing on Sunday, I had grave difficulty in hearing doorbells ringing in older houses because of insulation and double glazed windows.  I knocked on doors in a brand new estate in Carlow and I may as well have been knocking on paper walls.  I could hear the doorbell with crystal clarity when I rang, as well as a dog barking inside.  I thought to myself afterwards that the houses could not be built to the standard they should be in terms of heat and noise insulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">This Government has failed to look after citizens buying property.  I do not envy people buying property in Dublin and I wonder how many terraced or semi-detached properties have proper walls between neighbours.  This has significant implications for heat loss, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">It is time the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources worked together to enhance further the grants available to people for building new houses and insulating existing houses.  The building standards in the 1970s and 1980s were certainly not what they should have been and we must learn from that.  We all have a role to play and when we build a house.  It should require very little energy.  The key word in this is "insulation".</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I wish to ask the Minister about VAT on fuel bills.  Every day we are being crippled despite talk of a low-tax economy.  I discovered today that more than €600 million was taken in last year in VAT on gas, ESB and telecommunications.  We should consider the area and reduce the amount of VAT payable to help consumers who are being crippled.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">I was amazed to learn from the Minister of State's speech that we have 129 days of oil reserves, which is welcome.  It is amazing that whenever oil prices increase, they go up immediately at the petrol pumps but when they go down, there can be a few extra days or weeks before the consumer gets the benefit.  The Government should monitor and pursue this issue.  This begs the question why, if we have so much in reserve, and I presume petrol companies in this country buy in bulk, there is an immediate increase when the price of oil goes up and a slow decrease when its cost goes down.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_402">
          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_693">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House.  I also welcome the Bill before the House which focuses on the security of our supply of oil, the life blood of economic life in any country today.  I can think of no other substance whose loss would have such a profound effect on the workings of this planet and we, in common with just about every other country in the world, are entirely dependent on a steady, guaranteed supply of oil.  If I were to be flippant about it I would suggest that it is oil which really makes the world go round, and Ireland with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">A guaranteed supply of oil is vital for the development of the economy and, in so far as it is possible, we should maintain our oil reserves to a prudent level.  Most Members of this House will remember the oil shortages of 1973 and 1979, caused not by a visible diminution of the oil reserves of the Middle East but by a refusal of the oil states there to pump enough oil from the ground to meet world needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The 1973 shortage was caused by an embargo as a direct result of the Yom Kippur war between Israel and Egypt and we got squashed between the two factions.  The result was alarming across the world, with people no longer able to drive their cars with the same freedom as heretofore and economic activity threatened across the board.  It was the first time there had been a fuel shortage since the Second World War and people did not like it.  There were long lines of motorists at the petrol pumps queuing for the precious petrol, with negative consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">First, many were away from their work because filling stations were open for only a few hours a day and there was consequent loss of productivity.  Second, as a result of the long queues, engines were left running for long periods with consequent loss of fuel.  There was a feeling of doom and gloom over the country and an air of general insecurity.  It was pointless even for Governments to try to promise action, much less an increase in the availability of petrol.  We just had to sit there and take the punishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The point is that our economy, while dependent on oil even then, was not a fraction of what it is now.  A serious oil shortage, for whatever reason, be it a political act, a sense that world supplies are running out, or the result of conflict, would be disastrous, not only for Ireland but for the entire world trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">This was not an energy shortage <i>per se</i>.  There was no shortage of any type of energy except that derived from petroleum and there was no real shortage of petroleum, just that those who provided it had decided they were not being paid enough for it.  It is tempting to blame the oil suppliers of the Middle East for their greed, but they were only doing what any businessmen would have done and what most unprincipled businessmen would have done a lot sooner.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The result was that the price of a gallon of petrol jumped by 150%, which bit deep into the economy.  The only benefit may have been that it made us aware of the limitations of the supply of petroleum and brought us a new consciousness of the realities of energy limitations.  However, we have not done much different in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Like every other developing country, we have become very dependent on oil and gas and we must ask ourselves if those sources of energy will always exist in sufficient quantity to serve our needs.  We must begin to pursue and develop other sources of energy and there is no point in waiting until supplies of oil and gas begin to run out in earnest or become unavailable through political instability, natural disaster or other crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">We have seen such things happen in the past and paid the price through greatly inflated energy bills.  We must start now on the practical development and further research of solar energy, wind and wave power and hydro sources.  We should pursue an active programme of developing alternative forms of fuel in our transport fleet, especially biomass and ethanol.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Between 1990 and 2004, there was a large increase in oil imports to this country and, in that same period, the cost of oil rose from $15 a barrel to approximately $65 currently.  It has even been higher in recent months and the Iran crisis and the possibility of US military action against that country will not help to stabilise prices, except at an exorbitant level.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">There is no reason to believe the price of oil on the international markets or at the pumps will drop significantly in the near future.  In the past, the OPEC countries increased output to stabilise the price of oil on the world market, but this in turn has its own dangers in the faster reduction of reserves, which will also help to hasten a scarcity.  There was great uncertainty at that stage, something which we cannot afford to see happen again.  We live in a most uncertain age.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I know the National Oil Reserves Agency is responsible for maintaining emergency oil stocks in Ireland and Irish stocks held in other EU states under bilateral agreement.  Under these agreements, the host country agrees that it will not oppose the transfer of the oil in question to Ireland in the event of an emergency.  This is fine in theory and in the easy-going peaceful times of today, but we should face the possibility that if there were to be a worldwide shortage, and economies and national survival depend on oil supplies, it may well be a case of every country for itself and the principle of "What I have, I hold" may well come to the fore.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">There is nothing like being totally independent, as any farmer will say, for regardless of how friendly and helpful neighbours are, there is always some obligation when a machine, fodder or other item is loaned.  In times of crisis, it is better to be independent and have it oneself, and this is what I want to see in this country.  Quite simply, how can we guarantee the holding state will release whatever is being held in that country for us?  If the country has a problem, the natural instinct will be to keep it.  When the time comes, will our agreements hold up?  In times of crisis, principles can go out the window and practicalities take over.  We might well ask where this oil will be stored.  Will it be in the UK, elsewhere in Europe or even in western Europe?</p>
          <p eId="para_706">We have seen in recent years and months how Russia more or less held its neighbours to ransom by not releasing gas supplies until they were virtually on their knees.  We do not want to be that dependent or that vulnerable to pressure or blackmail.  Storage will have to be near this country and within the control of governments which will guarantee release of our stocks when required.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">Do we not have sufficient oil capacity ourselves, and should we provide further capacity within our jurisdiction, perhaps on an uninhabited island?  It strikes me that even if we were to store crude oil, the chances of getting it back in a crisis situation after it has been refined abroad may be rather slim.  Do we have the refining capability to produce petrol from crude oil and should we provide or extend it?  I have no doubt that the Minister of State will clarify these matters through the course of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Under section 23, a member of a local authority who becomes a director of the National Oil Reserves Agency would need to stand down from office.  I am somewhat puzzled by this because that member would have been democratically elected to administer public affairs.  I could understand more readily if the director were a Member of the Oireachtas or a Member of the European Parliament because NORA will report to both bodies and there could be a conflict of interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The right of a local authority member to sit on certain agencies has been curtailed by several recent Acts.  It is a provision with which I am uncomfortable.  It would appear that public representatives are being penalised for being elected and I am asking the Minister of State to re-examine this provision.  Such people are appointed to bodies such as NORA because they have expertise in a particular area and it would be unwise to lose that expertise if a member needed to resign or forgo membership of the board.  I am not in agreement with the principle that members of local authorities should not be included in any of these agencies or boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">It is important to fund research into the practicalities and provision of other forms of energy in Ireland, such as hydroelectric, wind, biomass, solar energy, etc.  These have worked well elsewhere and we have an abundance of wind and wave power that no other European country has.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">Waterford City Council is providing an affordable housing scheme in Ballygunner where the houses have not yet been allocated.  Solar panels have been installed in a number of houses for heating purposes and I commend the council on leading the way in this respect.  After some time, further information on the usefulness and economic viability of such energy generation will become available and local authorities and, perhaps, those in the private sector might follow suit.  I look forward to the day when solar energy panels or some other simple, but as yet unheard of, technology will be incorporated in every house to reduce the overall demand on public energy supplies.  Not that long ago, double glazing was non-existent or installed in only the more expensive and upmarket houses.  Now, it is standard practice in virtually every house being constructed or refurbished.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">This and other initiatives would go towards a reduction of our dependence on oil and I commend the Government on providing grants towards the provision of wood chip and other alternative energy boilers in houses.  There may be some difficulty in providing the burning material for these systems in sufficient quantities, which is a sure sign of growth in the market, but the market will react to ensure an adequate supply in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I welcome the Taoiseach's statement last weekend to the effect that he would like to ease planning regulations for the provision of solar panels and turbines in houses to generate electricity.  Currently, a small wind turbine on the side of a house needs planning permission, but encouraging this kind of innovation among new house providers would add to a growing independence from the use of oil and other fossil fuels with consequent benefits for our environment and balance of payments.  However, the planning process must be simplified and made more user-friendly.  It seems odd that the provision of a satellite dish on the side of a house does not need planning permission while a smaller wind turbine, which would be far more productive, does.  I welcome that the Taoiseach made this practical suggestion and I hope it will be implemented in the not too distant future.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">I regret that we are not making full use of our railways and that, through our history, they have been under-utilised.  This may have been justified in the economically slow decades after the foundation of the State, but we are well into our second decade of unprecedented growth and production.  There have been 15 years of expansion in the demand for consumer goods and it has been necessary to transport them around the country primarily by road.  We must take more transport vehicles off the road.  The port tunnel initiative was an excellent venture and, when fully facilitated, will further ease traffic congestion with greater fuel efficiency.  Trains would be even more fuel efficient and CIE must be encouraged to be more proactive in looking to expand its freight business because even our limited rail network has the potential to take a significant number of vehicles off the roads.  The development of any element of our rail transport system, whether freight or passenger, to attract more users has the same potential and we must work more diligently in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The Bill is a bold and far-sighted measure and deals with a subject which is vital to our national interest.  I commend it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_403">
          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_716">I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this important legislation which gives statutory effect to the establishment of the National Oil Reserves Agency.  No one has difficulty with the Bill in principle and it has been passed by the Dáil.  The Labour Party welcomes the statutory underpinning of NORA, which is long overdue.  It started life in the Dáil before the 2006 summer recess and was discussed considerably.  I am sure it will not take long to pass through this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">As speakers have stated, providing NORA with statutory underpinning is important because everyone knows how dependent our country is on oil.  That consumption <i>per capita</i> increased by more than 50% between 1990 and 2002 is notable and is in line with economic expansion and a great level of economic activity.  Oil is the most significant element of our dependency, accounting for more than 55% of our total primary energy requirement in 2004.  As Senator Kenneally pointed out, we must examine alternatives.  We do not need to be told that the world’s oil production will peak.  When that will be is a matter of some discussion and dispute.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">As an economy with a significant energy requirement, we must examine our responsibility under the Kyoto Agreement, especially the manner in which we are overdependent on unsustainable energy sources, including oil, which has a considerable impact in terms of global warming.  We have a responsibility, but the Government is not living up to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">How quickly the context and conversation have changed is notable.  Everyone knows that we must move away from our oil dependency.  As there is a public will to do so, I appeal to the Government to build on that will in a better way than it has done.  We must reduce our emissions, make our contribution to a safer world, recognise the dangers posed by an accelerated rate of global warming and allow people to use alternatives.  I do not disagree with Senator Kenneally's suggestions.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">I am a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, at which a presentation was made by a Dutch expert two years ago or more.  He claimed that our capacity for wind energy is so great that we could, if we managed it properly, be in a position to export it from this country.  Think about how that would even further transform the level of national wealth.  Ireland could be selling energy to our neighbours and into the European grid.  It must be asked why we are not doing this.  We would become as rich, in those terms, as oil producing countries have been for years.  Furthermore, wind as a resource will never run out.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I should like to know why we are not developing wind energy at a greater level than we are currently.  I come from a constituency where one has not to drive too far to see turbines and I have no difficulty with them.  We should also be developing the capacity for offshore wind energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">I am sure research has been done on the potential downsides to wind energy, in other words storage, in the context of Ireland being connected to the European grid.  We know that oil will ultimately run out.  Before that point is reached, however, supply could be problematic, given that in many cases it must be sourced from some of the world's more unstable regions.  The level of production available on world markets is not something we can control.  Given the upward price variations in oil in recent years and our dependency on it, it would be irresponsible not to look for alternatives and ways in which to reduce this dependency.  In terms of the heating of homes and buildings there are many options available such as solar energy, wood chip and ways of tapping into the earth's natural energy through piping.  Energy may be tapped low underneath a house simply by piping.  All of these initiatives involve sustainable sources of energy.  Bio-ethanol has been mentioned as well.  None of these solutions will solve our energy problems on their own, but taken together in an overall strategy, their potential as alternatives must be accelerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I have mentioned emissions, carbon tax, the footprint question, all new terms that we have become familiar with only recently.  People ask me all the time why new houses are not required to have solar panels.  They ask why developers are not required to ensure that houses are meeting the standards necessary for fuel consumption to be at the most efficient and effective levels.  We are simply not doing enough in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">We also face a major issue with regard to our carbon tax responsibilities.  Much of that, strictly speaking, is not the concern of this legislation, nonetheless I welcome the opportunity to raise these matters.  We need a comprehensive strategy for developing alternatives.  We need an effective and speedy strategy to reduce our dependence on oil.  We not only know that oil will run out, but it is a non-sustainable resource and as such, contributes to global warming.  We have responsibilities to the future, not only in environmental but economic terms, to manage a rapidly changing situation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_404">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_725">I welcome this legislation.  I have some knowledge of its pre-history.  In the late 1970s I was working on the energy section in the Department of Foreign Affairs with the then Department of Industry and Commerce and I have a clear recollection of all the discussions that were going on, with the EEC and more particularly, the International Energy Agency, IEA, about the holding of reserves.  Ireland was hit, as were other countries, by the second international oil crisis.  Other speakers have evoked spectacles of the long queues, shortages and enormous price rises which seriously disrupted the economy.  People are apt to give political explanations of our difficulties in the 1970s and 1980s and these are valid enough, up to a point.  However, it was the background of the enormous increase in the price of oil that created difficulties for all the western economies.  The international recession that hit after the second oil crisis, in 1980, was very deep.  It lasted a good deal longer in Ireland than in most other countries.  None of us is in any doubt about the importance of measures that will help to cushion us, to a degree, against the repetition of those circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Taking a 25 year perspective, undoubtedly all countries have reduced somewhat what was then an acute dependence on imported oil.  There has been a recognition of the need to diversify sources of energy, a matter that is preoccupying us as well.  For a period the Government in the late 1970s established the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, INPC.  It required one of the most inspired pieces of State body acquisition, the Whitegate oil refinery.  This was started by the outgoing Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition and completed by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government in the spring of 1982.  Even though a levy had to be imposed we were buying some degree of security of supply.  There was also the Whiddy Island oil terminal, where some of the reserves were stored.  As time passed we found we could have pragmatic arrangements whereby reserves for which particular countries were responsible could be held abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">We are not without occasional distant rumbles of thunder when it comes to energy supply, with politically motivated interruptions to gas supplies from Russia and other countries in eastern Europe, where the control of pipelines is mostly from Moscow.  In the event, the temptation for the Kremlin to use some of its potential political clout is virtually irresistible, at least in the local areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">There is also the political stand-off in terms of the Iraq war which severely disrupted supplies from what had been one of the most important oil producers in the Middle East, apart from Saudi Arabia.  There is also the political situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Iran.  We certainly hope President Bush’s assurances that war will not break out there prove correct.  Were conflict to break out, especially between the West and Iran, oil supplies could be highly disrupted.  We certainly are not out of the woods.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I would be much happier if we were able to do more and that it was within our power to increase our security of supply.  I am not referring to oil.  The prolonged and continued stand-off over the Corrib gas field is not in the national interest.  I hope that situation will be resolved.  Perhaps on the other side of a general election, regardless of how it goes, it may be easier to resolve it.  In the run-up to a general election, agitation on matters by various groups tends to increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The country needs those gas supplies, not because they would be available at a cheaper price than the world gas price, because that would not make economic sense, as we discovered with the Kinsale gas field and other forms of subsidised gas which were used for a period when employment was much less readily available and much more needed than today, but primarily from a security of supply point of view.  While the initial stages of the project in terms of public relations and consultation with the local community left a great deal to be desired, many extraneous matters were brought into the issue.  While safety considerations are legitimate matters for local groups to be concerned about and protest about, national energy policy is not a matter for groups to exercise obstruction.  National energy policy is a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">I do not have much sympathy with what seems to be 1970s style national resource socialist thinking, the type of thinking that inspired decisions taken when Justin Keating was the Minister in charge of energy in the mid-1970s.  We have moved on from that and more than 30 years have passed since then.  Nobody expects that oil and gas supplies in this country, even if we have more of them than we suspect, will make us a wealthy nation.  I remember writing papers in 1979 or 1980 on the political and economic consequences of oil-gas finds, which was an interesting exercise.  Ireland has not turned out to be, and clearly will not be, a second Norway in terms of abundance of supply.  We have managed to make significant progress in terms of prosperity through entirely different routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">Energy is still important and the high cost of it is one of the threats in terms of the challenges to our competitiveness and continued prosperity.  Oil will not be black or Spanish gold that somehow transforms the country.  Any thinking based on that is fallacious.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">We still need to pay attention and attribute importance to having in place a proper energy conservation policy.  I accept there is such a policy and initiatives to encourage it but we need to keep working on that.  The Taoiseach, at the recent Ógra Fianna Fáil conference in Galway, made a number of energy related environmental proposals, which I hope the next Government will implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">I very much support this necessary Bill.  It is important but it will only take us so far.  Our security of energy supply relies on much more than energy policy, important though that is.  It also relies on how international politics and diplomacy are conducted.  It is important that we reduce the energy intensity of our economy.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_735">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  Since the Second Stage debate on it in the other House last June, much has changed on the energy, environmental and agricultural fronts in regard to alternative energy.  My party has made considerable strides to fill the gap left by Government's inaction on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">This Bill allows us the chance to discuss the issue with which it is supposed to deal, namely, the availability of vital fuel supplies in a rapidly changing world.  Our perspective today is dramatically different from even six months ago when this Bill was first debated, and it was recognised that alternative sources of energy to oil must be utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">If our economy continues to grow at its current rate, and it is to be hoped it will, demand for oil and various forms of energy will see a similar growth.  It is up to us to ensure we opt for renewable energy alternatives in every case possible, which would dramatically reduce the impact in terms of the importation of fuels into this economy with the related economic and environmental cost.  As an island, we are in a catch-22 situation.  We import oil but need it to fuel the transportation necessary to bring in this essential fuel.  Imports cannot be brought in underground and require transport by air or sea, increasing carbon emissions in the pursuit of more emission causing fuels.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Alarm bells are ringing loudly concerning climate change here and elsewhere in the world.  Friends of the Earth and other groups spoke on this issue, which was hotly debated, at a meeting of a joint committee today.  The Government has been persuaded to give up its passive stance on this issue and is responding, if somewhat belatedly, to the fact that we have one of the highest levels of greenhouse emissions per head of population in the world, exceeded only by the US and Luxembourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The European Commission's plan to force car makers to cut the amount of carbon dioxide produced by their cars to an average figure of 130 g per km by 2012 is welcome, but this 19% cut, however, is only a step and must be augmented in Ireland by Fine Gael's plan to charge heavy polluting vehicles a higher rate of VRT, a proposal Fianna Fáil completely side-stepped.  The European Commission has taken a vital step in standing up to producers of big heavy polluting cars and this cut should do much to tackle greenhouse gas emissions across Europe.  However, this figure relates to average output and while there are many makes of car that already emit less than 130 g of CO2 per kilometre, there are other makes of large luxury cars producing twice the target amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">A carrot and stick approach is needed to confront these polluters.  In power, Fine Gael will reduce emissions from vehicles by establishing a system of energy-efficiency labelling for vehicles and rewarding those that are awarded a higher rating with a reduced rate of VRT.  Similarly, vehicles with a lower rate of efficiency will be penalised with a higher rate of VRT.  Fine Gael published this policy as long ago as November 2005, inviting the Government to adopt the proposal as it is vital carbon dioxide emissions are cut.  Fianna Fáil completely ignored this issue, blocking Fine Gael's VRT plan and providing a 12-month window in the last budget for a massive increase in sales of vehicles that emit huge amounts of greenhouse gas.</p>

          <p eId="para_743">The release by the ESB of two sites for the development of new independent power stations at Lanesboro, County Longford and Shannonbridge, County Offaly, have the potential to provide a much needed injection to the development of the renewable crop sector in Ireland, especially in the midlands.  These two new sites have the ability to support local jobs and the farming community and to put renewable crops firmly on the agenda.  Under an agreement between the ESB and the Commission for Energy Regulation, the site of the former Lanesboro and Shannonbridge power stations will be offered for sale with immediate effect to independent electricity generators.  This is a very positive development and has huge potential to kick start the development of wood chip fuelled power stations in the midlands, which would support local employment in the harvesting and chipping of crops such as willow.</p>

          <p eId="para_745">It would also provide local farmers with an alternative cash crop that would sustain rural communities.  Wood chip provides a more sustainable long-term income to farmers compared with biofuels, which are prone to competition from imports. Therefore, such a policy would also address Ireland's vulnerability to imported oil, gas, coal and biofuels, which in the longer term could have an impact on the location of foreign direct investment in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The failure by the Government to implement a co-ordinated strategy on renewable energy will reduce the positive potential impact of the two new sites.  This is because of the contradictory approach taken by different Departments.  For example, farmers who grow such crops will lose their REPS and disadvantaged area payments.  This is regrettable because farmers who wish to grow alternative crops will be denied those payments.  Under the Department of Agriculture and Food's scheme for promoting the growing of renewable energy crops, a local farmer in REPS would lose €12,000 of existing income by growing 100 acres of such crops.  Land in the counties of Longford, Westmeath, Roscommon and Offaly would be ideally suited to growing renewable energy crops such as willow, but it is less beneficial to grow the crops in these areas due to the clawback structure being put in place by the Department.   Under the Minister's scheme, farmers will receive grants to grow elephant grass and willow. However, if they receive this grant, they will not be able to draw down their REPS or disadvantaged area payments on lands used to produce energy crops.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">It is also imperative that the Government sets clear targets for the wood energy sector in Ireland.  There are currently no targets in place to allow for the replacement of imported fossil fuels with domestic wood energy.  Such a strategy is now urgently required and in tandem with this the Government must introduce a public service obligation. The public currently pays a small levy per unit of electricity which is then used to subsidise Bord na Móna for its peat production, as peat cannot compete with oil and coal.  This levy is in place as peat is our only indigenous energy source. Therefore, it is vital to extend this levy to other indigenous energy sources, such as renewable energy.  However, as it stands, unlike peat, renewables are at a commercial disadvantage as they do not receive support.</p>

            <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
            <p eId="para_767">I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this important issue.  I am concerned about the level of traffic control in new and existing housing estates around the country.   My greatest concern is, obviously, for the housing estates throughout County Clare, but I suppose the problem exists in every county.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">Local authorities are making no effort to restrict the speed of traffic through estates.  Some older estates have wider roads where cars can travel at considerable speed.  The nature of modern day living is that houses in many estates are rented out.  The result is that many young people in their first job live in these houses and have cars.  These people are more carefree and may have a more careless approach than traditional householders.  Unfortunately, this makes life extremely difficult for young families living in these estates.  The one positive aspect of older estates is that back gardens are bigger and people can let their children play there.  However, in many new developments, following the guidelines issued by the Department on greater densities, smaller sites and communal play or green areas, children must spend more time on the public roadways of their estates.  This has created a major problem for parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">We are about to enter the summer period and children will have no place to play except in these open public areas, in close proximity to young men and women who are driving for the first time and who may have a careless approach.  Unfortunately, they create a serious hazard.  As a result many parents will not let their children out and confine them to small back yards or gardens.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">In addition, some councils have not progressed their play programmes or the provision of playgrounds.  However, I will not get into that now.  My purpose in raising this motion is to seek assistance from the Department for the provision of funding to local authorities that will allow them install speed restricting devices in estates.  They should limit the width of roadways, put in some kind of chicane that would cause people to slow down or install speed ramps or bumps.  This requires funding and local authorities need help in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">For new estates a revision of planning guidelines could ensure planning conditions are changed to ensure all new developments above a certain size or with roads of a certain length are required to put speed restrictions in place, whether by way of traffic islands or other mechanisms.  I have sought the assistance of both town and county local authorities in County Clare in this regard.  However, they have refused to put in speed restricting measures for a variety of reasons, mainly funding and the fact that if they put them in one estate they will have to put them in all estates.</p>
            <p eId="para_772">We must accept there is a problem.  We must deal with the legacy of the existing estates and for future developments we must change guidelines to put a condition on builders to install restrictions.  Developers would, in many cases, be happy to do this as the cost would be relatively small at construction stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">I appeal to the Minister, for the sake of young children, to ensure the Government continues to strive for safer roads and give consideration to these proposals.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_774">I thank Senator Dooley for raising this matter.  I accept traffic control is an important issue which could contribute so much to the quality of life in residential developments.  Providing homes to people in sustainable communities is at the heart of the Government's policy as set out in the new detailed housing policy statement launched recently.  The Government's policy includes a strong focus on building active and successful communities through quality housing and is committed to continuing improvements in the quality of houses and neighbourhoods.  Guidance on best practice on planning new housing developments in urban areas is set out in the residential density guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">Recent guidance on the important issue of traffic calming is contained in the traffic management guidelines manual which was issued in 2003 by the Department of Transport and my Department.  The essential points of these guidelines will be restated in the Department's new sustainable residential development guidelines which will be available in draft form later this year.  The purpose of the Traffic Management Guidelines manual was to provide guidance on a variety of issues including traffic planning, traffic calming and management, incorporation of speed restraint measures in new residential designs, and the provision of suitably designed facilities for public transport users and for vulnerable road users.  It was prepared in line with national and regional transport strategy guidelines that promote sustainability and accessibility through improvement to, and better management of, the transport system.  It was designed to provide assistance to a wide range of people including local authority officials, developers, voluntary organisations and the general public, and also Departments and their agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">Section C of the manual deals with speed management and traffic calming.  It gives advice on traffic calming measures, both for existing roads and new roads.  A number of traffic calming measures are suggested for existing roads, for example, traffic islands, mini-roundabouts, chicanes, ramps, speed cushions.  Guidance is provided in respect of the suitability of the various traffic calming measures for different categories of roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">On new areas, however, the guidelines state that it is possible to constrain speeds without the need to resort to remedial treatments such as ramps.  Here the opportunity exists to use horizontal alignment constraints backed up by good urban design to keep speeds low.  The careful positioning of buildings, landscaping and the use of different materials can help to reinforce the need to reduce speed and reduce the dominance of motor vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">A number of further measures are also recommended for new areas.  These include entry treatment, shared surfaces, carriageway narrowings and chicanes, speed reduction bends, speed control islands, priority junctions and traffic islands.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">Traffic calming measures may be funded under the low cost safety improvement works scheme of grants, once the roads have been taken in charge by the local authority.  This year the Department has allocated almost €8 million to local authorities in respect of low cost safety improvement works on non-national roads.  Local authorities may also use discretionary improvement and block grants, which are allocated to county councils and urban authorities, respectively, to fund such works.  This year discretionary improvement and block grant allocations to local authorities total almost €41 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">Senators will be aware that development contributions, which are attached as conditions of planning permissions, may be spent on a range of public infrastructure benefiting the development.  The relevant categories of infrastructure include traffic calming measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">I am satisfied, therefore, that planning authorities have available detailed guidance on the provision of traffic control measures in all new housing developments, and also that they have adequate funding for such measures in both new and established areas.  The Department keeps the need for further planning guidelines under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">I fully understand the matter raised by Senator Dooley.  Better design can help to reduce many of the problems before they arise.  Considerable money is coming into many local authorities through development contributions and council members should press the officials that there is no point in hoarding the money and they have the authority to spend it on items such as those to which Senator Dooley referred.   I thank Senator Dooley for raising the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_783">I thank the Minister of State.  In particular, the reassuring element here is that the Traffic Management Guidelines of which he spoke issued from the Department of Transport and in many cases may have been taken by local authorities to refer to village environments or roads in built up areas rather than to within the confines of housing estates.  The fact that the Minister of State intends to restate these through his new sustainable residential development guidelines will act as a further method of enhancing in the minds of planners the necessity to ensure that speed restrictions and the management of traffic through estates is adequately addressed at the planning stage.  I would welcome any further measures he might consider such as his Department putting conditions on developers to ensure a traffic safety audit of developments with more than ten houses as part of the planning process.  We ensure safety audits in environmental impact statements and in other cases, and it would be helpful to carry out such audits in advance of applications being granted permission.</p>

            <p eId="para_784">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me raise this important matter of the situation faced by a number of former miners in the Ballingarry, Thurles area.  Ballingarry was the location for coal-mining for a good number of years.  Coal-mining was a strong industry in this area until it ceased a number of years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">During the period when this group of miners were working in these mines the level of safety measures which are nowadays taken for granted did not apply.  When one speaks to these men one sees evidence of the kind of conditions under which they worked.  In some cases, explosions took place in the unvented underground mines in which they worked and carbon monoxide was not able to escape.  In some cases, they worked in tunnels only 18 inches high.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">Not surprisingly, as a result they have been left with significant and serious health problems some of which could be described as miner's lung, which usually incorporates conditions such as bronchitis, asthma and emphysema which result in breathing difficulties.  These are progressive diseases.  Other conditions arising from these miners' experiences would include tinnitus, for instance, which is a degree of deafness, and numbness in the extremities including fingers.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">I refer to a group of approximately ten men.  They feel strongly that their pensions are entirely inadequate and, more importantly, do not recognise the level of disease and suffering from which they are suffering.  Having met a number of the men involved, it seems extraordinary that it cannot be recognised that this is a group who deserve to be compensated for the progressive nature of their illnesses in some way for what remains, in some cases possibly a short period, of their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">A number of miners have died, some at a young age, as a result of the diseases which they contracted as a result of their work, and this is not being recognised.  They have had a long, as yet unsuccessful, battle to be properly compensated for the illnesses from which they suffer.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">One of the difficulties they face is that some of them were assessed a good number of years ago for the illness and injury suffered, but there is no possibility of them being reassessed despite the fact that theirs is a progressive illness account of which should be taken in what they receive.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">These men feel strongly that they have been abandoned and also that they have been the subject of broken promises.  They have been given the impression that there is compensation available to them and one of the matters on which I seek clarity is what is the Government's attitude to this group.  The Taoiseach met the group only a short number of weeks ago in Killenaule when he was in this part of Tipperary.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">I ask the Minister to clarify exactly the Government position on this matter.  I particularly urge the Government to address the case of these miners and ensure they get what they need.  Is the Government planning a compensation scheme?  If not, why not?  What is the Government's response to the claims of the miners?  We are talking about a one-off set of circumstances faced by a small number of people and it should not be impossible, therefore, to acknowledge the problem and to deal with it.   The men themselves feel very strongly that they made a great contribution to the economy, not only that of their area but also that of the country, at a time when conditions were very difficult.   They rightly feel they are now living in a prosperous state and that it, therefore, would not be too much to ask that their suffering be recognised and that they receive compensation as a result.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_792">I thank the Senator for raising this issue and will respond to it on behalf of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan.  The social welfare code already provides for payments to former mine workers who suffered a loss of faculty arising from their employment as miners.  Disablement benefit, payable under the occupational injuries benefit, OIB, scheme, is a compensation payment for loss of faculty arising out of or in the course of insurable employment.  The legislation governing the scheme provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases listed in the legislation and where persons have contracted such diseases in the course of their employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">Miners may be entitled to disablement benefit if they suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation they contracted at work.  Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparing the state of health of the applicant with that of a person of the same age and gender.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">Miners who contracted the prescribed disease pneumoconiosis are entitled to disablement benefit.  There are currently 19 miners in receipt of disablement benefit in respect of pneumoconiosis, seven of whom were former Ballingarry miners.  These miners and their representatives have also sought to have other conditions, specifically chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, included as a recognised disease for the purpose of the OIB scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">The question of whether COPD should be added to the list of prescribed diseases was considered in the Department in 2003 and it was advised that COPD is a common clinical condition that accounts for 10% of total medical admissions to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin.  COPD is not a condition that is specifically linked to a particular occupation and it is not possible to establish a causal link between coal mining, or any other occupation, and the experience of COPD.  Smoking is by far the most common cause of COPD.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">The Department was also advised that no EU state, other than the United Kingdom, includes COPD in a scheme equivalent to our OIB scheme.  The position in the United Kingdom is that its equivalent of our OIB may be paid to coal miners who have worked underground for at least 20 years and who are diagnosed as having pneumoconiosis with considerable lung function loss.  The effect of prescribing COPD or chronic bronchitis and emphysema was not to confer entitlement to people who did not already qualify for the UK equivalent of OIB but rather to enable a higher rate of payment to be made to some pneumoconiosis sufferers in certain circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">In this country, OIB may be awarded where miners develop pneumoconiosis as a result of their occupation.  Persons claiming OIB in cases of pneumoconiosis are referred to a consultant respiratory physician in the first instance for an examination and report.  This examination consists of a clinical assessment and pulmonary function testing.  The latter is a standardised test that establishes the extent of lung malfunction irrespective of the specific medical condition giving rise thereto.  Disablement benefit is awarded on the basis of the consultant's objective report, including the pulmonary function test results.  If COPD is present in some of these cases, the disablement award will reflect this.  Given this background, it was concluded that it would not be appropriate to specify COPD for the purposes of the OIB scheme.</p>

          <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_436">
            <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_802">I welcome the Minister to the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">This matter concerns the urgent need for the Department of Education and Science to provide an update on the provision of a temporary teacher for St. Mary's national school, Drumlish, County Longford — roll No. 16665S.  The position is urgently required to take account of the increased enrolment at this four-teacher school due to the proliferation of new housing in Drumlish.  I am at a loss to understand the lack of action taken on this matter by the Department and its untoward delay in providing the school with a temporary teacher until the end of this school year, with a view to upgrading the post to a permanent one next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">The principal and board of management made an application to the Department some time ago and parents at the school have signed a petition highlighting the overcrowding affecting their children's education.  I have received numerous representations from parents, who are concerned for their children, and from the principal, Elizabeth Brady, the board of management and the teachers, who are providing top-quality education in extremely difficult circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">There has been a great increase in the number of houses in Drumlish.  Four new developments are already completed and almost 200 houses are now occupied.  This has lead to increased demand for places at the school.  There were 82 pupils enrolled at the school in 2003 and enrolment now stands at 118.  This number is increasing and 120 are to be enrolled by Easter.  However, despite the best efforts of the staff, the school is bursting at the seams, such that there is one class with 38 children and another with 31.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">Implementing the new child-centred curriculum under such circumstances is extremely difficult.  Class size represents the key challenge in the implementation of the curriculum.  Smaller class sizes lead to more space for the individual pupils, increased one-to-one contact with teachers, better opportunities for children to engage in discussions and fewer distractions.  The teacher becomes more familiar with pupils, can use innovative teaching techniques and has a greater opportunity to identify individual difficulties.  Grouping of pupils is more difficult to achieve in large classes.  Groups containing large numbers are less effective, whereas too many small groups make it is impossible for the teacher to allow sufficient time for every student.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">Why is the Department of Education and Science continuing to turn a blind eye to the situation in St. Mary's, given the proven problems associated with large class sizes and the acknowledged benefits of a realistic pupil-teacher ratio?  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, contributed to yesterday's statements in this House on the Learning to Teach report, when she stated:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_808">All the expenditure and activity in the education system is ultimately designed to benefit the pupils.  Central to this is ensuring that the quality of the education they receive is second to none.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">The Minister will have to admit that, given the appalling situation in St. Mary's national school, where two classes have 38 and 31 pupils, respectively, her statements will be taken with a grain of salt.  Education is the key to our children's futures but closing the purse strings when it comes to the staff needed for dynamic and thriving schools such as St. Mary's is counter-productive.  In County Longford, we are extremely proud of schools such as St. Mary's, which have opened their doors to all newcomers to the area, but I am deeply concerned that the Minister will permit them to become victims of their own success.  I would welcome a positive response to my request.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_437">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_810">I thank Senator Bannon for raising this matter today because it gives me the opportunity to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science.  The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners.  The staffing schedule is set out in a circular which issues from the Department to all primary school boards of management.  Accordingly, all boards are aware of the staffing allowance for their schools in any school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">Major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years.  There are currently 4,000 more primary teachers than in 2002, the average class size in our primary schools is 24 and one teacher is employed for every 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers.  Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them make the most of their time at school.  Given the thousands of extra primary teachers who have been hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Furthermore, this Government is committed to providing even more primary teachers next year to reduce class sizes.  All primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios, some having as few as two teachers for 12 pupils, but the general rule is one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  Next September, this ratio will decrease to 27 children per classroom teacher.  School authorities are requested to ensure the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking into account all relevant contextual factors, such as classroom accommodation and fluctuating enrolment.  In particular, school authorities should ensure an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and keep to a minimum the differential between the largest and smallest classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">A further initiative which has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year, the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools which are experiencing large annual increases in enrolments.  More than 280 such posts were sanctioned in the 2006-07 school year, compared to 170 in 2005-06.  The school to which the Senator referred had an enrolment on 30 September 2005 of 90 pupils, which warranted staffing for the 2006-07 school year of a principal and three mainstream teachers.  The school also has the services of one temporary language support teacher and one permanent learning support and resource teacher.  The board of management has submitted a report indicating that there were 112 pupils enrolled in the school on 30 September 2006.  The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2007-08 school year will be determined based on that figure and by reference to the staffing schedule for the 2007-08 school year.  It is expected that this staffing schedule will issue to all primary schools before the end of March 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">To ensure openness in the teacher allocation system at primary level, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing.  This primary staffing appeals board has been in place since August 2002.  I am sure the Senator will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">The improvements that have been made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled but this Government is determined to go even further, and the 2007 Estimates make provision for an additional 800 primary teachers.  About 500 of these will be classroom teachers, which is evidence of our commitment to reduce class sizes.  I assure the Senator this Government will continue to prioritise further improvements in school staffing and continue to focus on measures to improve the quality of education in primary schools to ensure increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.</p>

          <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_438">
            <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_815">All I am requesting is the appointment of a temporary teacher until September.  Children receive only one chance at primary education but parents and staff are concerned that the pupils of the school are not getting a fair chance because the pupil-teacher ratio is too high.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">The Minister of State might cut through the bureaucracy and red tape to appoint a temporary teacher until September, when the school will automatically qualify for an extra teacher.  It is important that politicians deliver for their communities.  In health, education and law and order, the system is top-heavy with bureaucracy but, as politicians, we have to be seen to cut through the red tape to deliver services.  Mine is a simple request but it is a very important one for the children of the catchment area of Drumlish.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State used his good offices to act on their behalf.</p>

            <p eId="para_817">Some level of bureaucracy is necessary to ensure consistency, openness and accountability.  The school has the services of one temporary language support teacher and one permanent learning support and resource teacher.  The staffing schedule for the next academic year will issue to the school in March 2007.  I will bring Senator Bannon's plea to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin.</p>
