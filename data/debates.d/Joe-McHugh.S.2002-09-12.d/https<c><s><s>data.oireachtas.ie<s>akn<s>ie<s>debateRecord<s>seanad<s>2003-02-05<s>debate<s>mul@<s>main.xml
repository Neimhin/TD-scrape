          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to act immediately to restore the physically disabled person's grant in north Tipperary, in view of the operation of the scheme having been suspended, due to financial difficulties being faced by North Tipperary County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Wilson of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Transport to review the level of public transport services on the Cavan-Dublin bus route with particular reference to the need to improve the availability of early morning services.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

          <p eId="para_6">Today's Order of Business is No. 2, referral motion regarding the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Bill 2002 to the Standing Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills, to be taken without debate; No. 3, Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 – Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time; No. 4, Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill 2002 – Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to conclude not later than 6 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time; and No. 12, motion No. 24, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Debate on No. 3 will commence after the Order of Business and will conclude at 2.30 p.m. but should there be remaining speakers at this time, Second Stage will be resumed on another day.

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_8">I welcome the fact that there is to be no guillotine on the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 because there will be many contributions from all sides of the House on this proposal from the Government which we and other parties will be opposing. Will the Leader consider allowing general contributions of perhaps 15 minutes. There are significant issues in the Bill which colleagues might wish to raise with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government? I ask her to consider a 15 minute time slot and colleagues can share time if they wish. I do not think it is right that Senators should be limited to ten minutes for general contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I want to raise the issue of the latest attempted gangland killing which took place in Dublin last night. The Leader and others will be aware that another shooting occurred in Drimnagh, which brings to a very sorry state the number of attempted murders that have taken place in this country since 1 January this year. It is the worst January on record in regard to the number of murders and attempted murders. Will the Leader find out from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if the Government will bring additional legislative measures to both Houses of the Oireachtas concerning this latest spate of gangland killings? Will the Government put additional resources at the disposal of the Garda Síochána? It is quite clear the situation is getting out of control. The attempted murders, the situation in Limerick last week and the general level of attacks taking place in this and other cities must be quickly nipped in the bud.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">In the 1990s, the Government responded swiftly by way of the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Proceeds of Crime Bill to get rid of the drug gangs that were creating fear throughout this city. These people left the country but it seems they are now back in business. I ask the Government, through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to take strong action in this matter and bring to the House additional legislative measures to ensure these people are taken out of business. January 2003 has been the worst period on record in terms of the number of murders that have occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Given that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is meeting later tonight – I am not attempting to comment on or pre-empt any decision taken by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges – will the Leader provide time over the next week or so for a short debate on Seanad reform? She and others have led on this issue in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. We need to bring the matter to a conclusion so that a sub-committee can be established to deal with the issue. All parties should make a public statement in this House about the composition of the sub-committee, including its work and timeframe, so that the public will see we are serious about the matter and will do something about it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_12">The latter point made by Senator Brian Hayes could be dealt with if the report on the first couple of meetings of the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges brings to the attention of the House proposals in relation to moving this matter forward. While I have no objection to a debate in the House, it would be a repeat of the previous debate on the subject. I would prefer if the recommendations were placed before the House for consideration. I hope such a move would satisfy Senator Hayes.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The tax revenue figures for January, published yesterday, should be a matter of concern to Senators. I believe the inflation figures for January will be released next week. The Department of Finance, for the first time ever, has compiled and published its monthly revenue and expenditure projections. It would be helpful if the Minister for Finance was to participate in a debate in this House to indicate his Department's thinking on the issues involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I am sick and tired of being told how to live our lives by certain people who describe themselves as economists, although they may be third level teachers. They are paid by various financial interests in this country. Although their figures are sometimes incorrect by as much as €1 billion, they bounce back as if such an error never happened. It seems as if they are running the country as they are always in the headlines. A discussion in this House, where public representatives can give their opinions, would be preferable. It would be worthwhile if it gave public representatives as much confidence as economists when speaking about economic matters, which is a simple thing to do. Most economists seem to work on the basis of placing their fingers in the air, which is not impressive, and have a vested interest in selling a product for a financial firm. The economy is not as complex as such people would have one believe. I would like, as part of a discussion in the House, to see ordinary public representatives taking part in a debate on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">Similarly, I would like the Leader to consider a debate on the operation of cartels and the phenomenon of price fixing. There seems to be lack of competition in various areas, mainly as a result of the Competition Authority's lack of resources. While the legislation passed last year is quite adequate, I propose that some of the funds raised through the operations of the Criminal Assets Bureau should be channelled into the Competition Authority which now deals with criminal matters and is badly in need of resources. I would welcome a debate on the matter.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_16">I ask the Leader of the House to endeavour to find out from the Government its plans, if any, to amend the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Those of us on this side of the House, particularly in my party, are aware that when negotiations were taking place between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party following the 1992 general election, the biggest sticking point with Fianna Fáil related to freedom of information.

I ask the question in the light of the fact that criminal gangs are rampant and terrifying communities. We are told that the latter problem is under control. Senator Maurice Hayes raised this issue on the Order of Business yesterday. The idea that the Army should be called in to deal with what is wrong and obviously embarrassing, at a time when we do not have the resources to protect people in our cities on Saturday nights or protect the public from criminal drug gangs, suggests that the Government's policy on fighting crime is essentially a public relations exercise and not linked to reality. It is high time that we had a debate on this country's real crime problems which are not found at Shannon Airport.</p>

The image of Shannon as a secure airport at which airlines can land is of importance. We should be concerned, not just about the 17 flights that have been lost to Frankfurt but also about the ultimate result of this. Decisions due to be made by other airlines about whether to use Shannon Airport in the future may have a detrimental effect on the livelihoods of those living in the mid-west region, from Senator Finucane's area to my own in County Clare, where people are very concerned. We should have a debate specifically on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I support Senator Brian Hayes in his comments about the Criminal Assets Bureau and the need to discuss this issue. Like the IRA, the drugs criminals never went away. They were in the north inner city all the time. We should note that the establishment of the CAB was largely the result of pressure from people such as Independent Deputy Tony Gregory in the other House, who insistently pushed for a relationship between the different areas of the State and was resisted by various Governments. Certain areas of our cities have been devastated by drugs. We should make sure that the money taken by the CAB is directed back into those areas, from which it was leached by these vampires, especially into programmes such as Breaking the Cycle, which helps children up to a certain point – it should be continued right through to third level to give the people concerned a chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">I ask the Leader whether she can give us any information about the proposals of the Minister for Finance, mentioned in the newspapers recently, to introduce legislation to tighten up tax loopholes. It is unconscionable that last year 29 of the 400 highest earners in the State paid no income tax whatever by using loopholes in property investment. While ordinary people have to pay tax the people concerned should not be allowed to get away with this. It is completely wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">With regard to economists, I do not share the blanket view of my colleague, Senator O'Toole.

          <p eId="para_91">I join in the calls for a debate on the full fiscal projections for the year ahead. It is timely. Given the closures last year and some of the outrageous predictions made, it would be no harm to bring a sense of balance to this debate and spread it out evenly over a 12 month period. As public representatives, we have a contribution to make in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">A debate on crime would be welcome. If public representatives are advocating the placing of armed soldiers on our streets, a debate is required to ensure a degree of transparency and clarity. We should remember that the deployment of troops at Shannon Airport as an aid to the civil power releases police to guard the streets. Providing a cordon within a seven mile radius around Shannon Airport is a role for the Defence Forces – a welcome one – but if people think we should be putting armed soldiers on the street, this country is in a sorrier state than I realised.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">Will the Leader ask the Government to clarify the position of asylum seekers in relation to the social partnership talks, which appear to be in some difficulty? Are asylum seekers to be excluded from the ambit of social partnership? If so, we should be very concerned. We in this House should have a chance to give our views on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Last week I asked the Leader about the strategic rail review and its publication and she was very helpful in her response. In the last few days many reports have appeared relating to the Booz Allen Hamilton report, which was presented to a sub-committee of the Cabinet last week. The only information that appears to be available to us is from media reports, an approach of which I do not approve. It is time for the Minister for Transport to come to the House and set out clearly not only the elements of the report but also his response to it. Many communities, including those in my area, are anxiously awaiting clarification of what the Government intends to do about the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Concerns have been raised about the Freedom of Information Act 1997, specifically the provision ensuring Cabinet documents are available to the public after five years. This is a matter for discussion at Government level. Given that this provision should come into operation on 21 April, it is important that the Taoiseach states clearly whether he intends to roll back this important and central provision of the Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">Usually this House, and countries generally, welcome the creation of new countries: the most recent new member of the family of the United Nations was East Timor, with which we have very strong relations. However, today marks the ending of a country. Seventy-five years ago, in the aftermath of the First World War, the state of Yugoslavia was created out of the remains of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. &gt;From today, the two remaining members of the former Yugoslavia will be known as the Serbian-Montenegrin Federation. There is an Irish dimension to this: Carlow County Council, through the initiative of Councillor Enda Nolan, a member of the Committee of the Regions, is providing administrative and other expertise in the restructuring of local government in the now Serbian city of Nis. As I understand Westmeath and Meath County Councils intend to pursue this, will the Leader convey to the Minister for the Foreign Affairs the good wishes of this House and the country towards the newly created state? Might we have an opportunity at some time of debating the role of this country in the restructuring in south-east Europe and the question of the stability pact?</p>

We might need more legislation or more gardaí or a combination of the two but the Government needs to address this problem. That is my question to the Leader.</p>

In the event of a European constitution being framed, it is entirely reasonable that it should refer to a higher authority, namely, God. Fears are raised about objections from people who hold no religious beliefs, even though many of them have no objections to such a reference. Pure secularism can be arid and sterile. It would be in the best interests of the new Europe to have a mention of God in a new constitution.</p>

The fear is greatest among elderly parents because they now have to take their sons and daughters home from residential institutions despite having had their expectations built up in the last couple of years.

          <p eId="para_105">When is it intended to bring the Finance Bill before the House? As I suspect it will not be for some months, we need to have an urgent debate on various aspects of the economy. For instance, the Government is responsible for some of the price rises which have led to inflation. ESB bills are up 12%, the television licence fee is up €150 and VHI premia are to rise by a further 18%. Inflation will be a challenge to the economy this year. We learned yesterday of a slump in tax income in the last month, benchmarking has become an issue – which I am sure Senator O'Toole would be happy to debate – and the social partnership deal is pending. Are we to wait until this is a <i>fait accompli</i> before we debate it or will we have a regular debate on the economy in the House? Will the Leader ensure this can happen in some form or other? It may be that other debates pending will enable us to do so but let us not wait until the Finance Bill is before us and it is all over.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The opening of Cabinet papers after five or ten years must have a serious impact on the ability of any Cabinet to do its work correctly. I believe totally in freedom of information but a Cabinet which knows its papers will be open to the public in five or ten years time will be affected. We must take steps to ensure the Cabinet works more efficiently without this provision hanging over its head.</p>

He recalled the period from 1995-96 when the Criminal Assets Bureau was established and other measures led to a diminution of crime at the time. Clearly, these matters move in cycles. I have asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if he will attend a question and answer session in the House. He was in the House with a Bill that was concluded yesterday. It is necessary that we express our opinions on this matter and the Minister has professed himself willing but it is a matter of finding a time that suits him.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">Senator Finucane raised the matter to which he referred in the House yesterday and on which there are divergent views. Senator Ryan answered across the benches, making a point about one not being supposed to shoot at people. There is no policy of shooting at people. In answer to both points of view and to Senator Dooley, it will clearly put people off coming to Shannon, leaving aside the matter of Iraq, the planes, and the troops in flight. The public here and abroad, particularly in the US, might ask if they will be landing where these things are happening when they come on their holidays. It is a huge deterrent to their coming to the mid-west region and Ireland eventually. Clearly, the right to protest in a peaceful way does not give the right to protest in a subversive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Senator Dooley asked for a debate on Shannon. I suggest that he raises the issue in the course of the debate on Iraq. That is what happened in the Dáil when that debate took place. I know the Senator feels strongly about that region.</p>

It is a matter that certainly needs to be debated. I reiterate what I said the Senator Ryan, which was borne out by other speakers, namely that when freedom of information was adopted we were way ahead of any other European country.

          <p eId="para_164">I am pleased to bring the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 before the Seanad. An Agreed Programme for Government commits the Government to implementing an ambitious action programme across the environmental agenda. In a democratic society, legislation is the foundation for action in the interests of the common good, including for the protection and improvement of the environment. Legislation alone is not enough, but without a strong framework of rules and regulations we will not achieve the environmental quality to which we aspire and to which the Government is committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">The Bill strengthens the law dealing with those industrial and other activities which have the potential to do the most damage to the environment. Its provisions impact for the good on all the key environmental media. It gives an enhanced focus for action by the EPA to secure energy efficiency and to regulate greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. It contains important new provisions to improve the implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation and it contains a number of key decisions which the Government feels are essential to strengthen further Ireland's approach to waste management.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The Bill is an important and substantial addition to Ireland's environmental legislation and it signals my determination to ensure that the environment receives the protection it deserves. It completes the transposition into law of the EU Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control 1996. Integrated pollution control (IPC) licensing under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, and waste licensing under the Waste Management Act 1996, have been administered by the EPA since 1994 and 1997 respectively. The licensing provisions of both Acts anticipated the provisions of the IPPC licensing directive and have delivered substantial compliance with it. IPC licensing has been implemented on a phased basis since 1994 and some 550 licences have been granted to date. These licences are in force across 13 economic sectors which have the potential, unless properly regulated, to cause significant pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">The licensing system is acknowledged to have secured substantial improvement in the environmental performance of the industrial and other activities concerned. There have been reduced air and water emissions, energy savings, moves to more environmentally friendly processes and lower noise emissions. Ireland was one of the first EU member states to implement integrated as opposed to single medium licensing. This was done in advance of the issue of the IPPC Directive and to this day we are recognised as among the leaders in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Building on our success to date, the Bill brings national legislation fully into line with the directive by amending the licensing provisions of both Acts. In the context of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, I draw the attention of Senators to a number of key new provisions arising from the directive. Transposing the directive requires a move from integrated pollution control to integrated pollution prevention and control. This change of words reflects the increasing emphasis we place on the prevention and minimisation of environmental problems at source rather than on controlling them after they have arisen.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The key changes to the operation of the licensing system are contained in chapter 2 of Part 2 of the Bill, section 12 of which replaces in full Part IV of the 1992 Act. The former sections 82 to 99 of the 1992 Act are being repealed and re-enacted with amendments in revised sections 82 to 99H. These 26 sections will constitute the core of the new IPPC code.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The new section 83(5) changes the technical basis of the licensing system from best available technology not entailing excessive costs – BATNEEC – to best available techniques – BAT. In practice, this is not likely to give rise to significant change as the definition of BAT in section 7 of the Bill includes reference to techniques available under economically and technically viable conditions, taking costs and advantages into account. Section 83(5) explicitly requires that energy be used efficiently in the carrying on of licensable activities. This makes sense both for industry in terms of working for the most cost efficient production practices and for the environment as we seek to reduce the adverse impacts of energy use.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Section 86 relates to conditions to be attached by the EPA to licences. Subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) makes it mandatory to include in licences conditions concerning key issues such as emission limit values, the minimisation of pollution, protection of soil and groundwater and provisions regarding the cessation of the activity in question. While many of these issues are already being by addressed by the EPA in IPC licences, the Bill now requires the inclusion of such conditions in licences. Senators will wish to note that the inclusion of greenhouse gases in the definition of “emission” in section 5 will, in conjunction with subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) of section 86, enable the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in licence conditions. This is an important additional measure to assist in meeting Ireland's obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Section 15 and Schedule 1 of the Bill extend the scope of licensing in light of the directive. While the 1992 Act sought to anticipate the details of the activities to be covered by the licensing regime, the directive as adopted contained some differences. The general approach I have taken in the Bill is to include the activities and thresholds specified in the directive or those already included in the 1992 Act, whichever yields the higher standard. I am determined that we retain what is best from the controls the Oireachtas put in place ten years ago as these have secured major benefits for the environment. I will build on to them to further the improvements arising from the directive. The directive brings more activities into the licensing regime, including poultry rearing, the treatment and processing of milk, the slaughtering of cattle, the production of food from animal or vegetable raw materials and the production of paper or board.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The Bill includes a number of transitional provisions. The new section 82 of the 1992 Act, to be inserted by section 12 of the Bill, proposes the following in relation to activities newly licensable by virtue of the directive. New activities will be licensable from the date that the section is commenced. Activities which started in the period from 30 October 1999 to the commencement of the section will be required to be licensed within six months of commencement or have a licence application submitted within that period. The 1999 date is the operative one for the purposes of the directive. Activities which were already in operation on 29 October 1999 will be licensable in the period up to 2007 as provided for in the directive. These are termed "established activities" in the Bill. Finally, licences in force under the 1992 Act will be examined by the EPA for compliance with the directive and the agency will take appropriate action to ensure full compliance by 2007. Such action can include the carrying out of a review of the licence, amendment of its conditions or a declaration in writing that no further action is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The second main focus of the Bill is to modernise the integrated licensing regime in light of a decade's experience. Amendments are proposed which facilitate better implementation and enforcement. Section 10 updates the level of penalties available to the courts and the maximum fine on summary conviction is increased to €3,000 from just under €1,300. The new section 83(5) introduces a requirement that an applicant for an IPPC licence be a "fit and proper person". This involves being free of convictions in relation to non-compliance with IPPC and waste codes and having the necessary skills and financial resources to carry on the activity in relation to which a licence is sought. I also draw the attention of the House to the new sections 94 and 95 which introduce detailed controls in relation to the transfer and surrender of licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">In a further provision, the new section 97 allows the EPA to revoke or suspend IPPC licences where the "fit and proper person" requirements are no longer met and this occurs in such serious circumstances as to warrant the action. Section 99H enables any person to take High Court proceedings where an activity is being carried on in contravention of the Act. In such cases, the High Court can make such order as it considers appropriate. Taken together, these measures represent a considerable strengthening and modernising of the powers available to the EPA in relation to implementation and enforcement of integrated licensing.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">In Part 3 of the Bill, we are making a number of important amendments to the Waste Management Acts. Despite the obligation under the 1996 Act to make waste management plans, it was not until the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001 was enacted that proposed regional waste management plans were finally adopted. The Act provided that the making of such plans would be an executive function and that the variation and replacement of plans would remain a reserved function subject to the consent of the relevant city or county manager over an interim period of four years. The focus of local authority efforts since 2001 should have been to ensure the rapid and efficient delivery of the improved services and infrastructure provided for in the plans. To be fair to most authorities, good progress is being made. However, some councils are already seeking to review and amend plans, essentially to unpick their provisions for an integrated waste management infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">I see no merit in revisiting issues that have already been fully debated and decided or in undermining existing plans. Accordingly, I propose to take matters to their logical conclusion and provide that the review, variation and replacement of a waste management plan shall also be an executive function for local authority management. Section 19 makes provision for this. There will continue to be full public consultation with regard to any such variation or replacement of plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Recently, the issue of local authority waste charges again became contentious. Seeking short-term political advantage, some Opposition parties purported to oppose household waste charges, citing various, but spurious, justifications. The position is simple. The polluter pays principle underpins European Union environmental policy and legislation and must be applied by member states. Specifically, EU waste legislation requires that households, as well as other waste producers, pay for the costs of disposing of their waste. Therefore, household waste charges are mandatory and are here to stay under Irish and EU law. It is wrong for some politicians to be disingenuous by pretending otherwise to the public. It only confuses the argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Our purpose is to create a proper waste management infrastructure, which will be to the benefit of all, including visitors and the tourism industry. To put this beyond doubt, I propose, in section 35, to insert a new section 75 into the 1996 Act, giving local authorities explicit powers to charge for waste services they provide. This section provides that the making and waiver of such charges shall be an executive function and is intended to facilitate the levying of charges on a per use basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">In section 22, local authorities are being given explicit power to discontinue the collection of domestic waste in the event of non-payment of charges. This addresses the consequences of a 2001 Supreme Court judgment, which found that local authorities currently do not have this right. As a result, they could only seek recovery of unpaid household charges as a normal contract debt through the appropriate courts, a system that is costly and unwieldy. I now propose to allow local authorities to respond in the most direct manner to those who will not pay for services provided and who expect their neighbours to subsidise them for the collection of their waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Further amendments are proposed to strengthen the 1996 Act in light of experience and, in particular, to facilitate more effective enforcement and legal action to combat unauthorised waste activity. The main proposals include the following: in section 21 to introduce a presumption, for the purposes of prosecutions, that the carrying on of an unauthorised waste activity shall be deemed likely to cause environmental pollution, unless the contrary can be shown, thereby shifting the emphasis of proof in a correct manner; in section 29 to provide a new power to the EPA to revoke or suspend a waste licence, particularly where a licensee can no longer be regarded as a fit and proper person to hold that licence; in sections 31 and 32 to extend to the EPA current local authority powers, enabling steps to be taken for the purpose of preventing or remediating environmental pollution; and in section 33 to provide explicitly for court orders where a waste activity is carried on other than under and in accordance with any requisite authorisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">A number of amendments are proposed which are of a technical nature. In particular, there is a provision in section 25 to empower the EPA to determine that where a waste activity is carried on in a facility associated with an IPPC licensable activity, a licence under either the 1992 or 1996 Acts, but not both, shall be required. A further provision in section 26 introduces amended requirements regarding the extent to which the EPA shall have regard to environmental impact statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The strengthened provisions in waste and IPPC law contained in the Bill underpin my determination to get tough, and stay tough, on polluting activity. Alongside the legislation, we will be putting in place an intensified enforcement drive, through the planned Office of Environmental Enforcement. The Bill will support a number of our objectives in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The final substantive part of the Bill, Part 4, gives effect to commitments in the Government's litter action plan to strengthen the law against litter. Section 38 requires that articles or advertisements exhibited in public places include the name and address of the person on whose behalf they are being exhibited. It also abolishes advertising by means of placing items on vehicles. These changes are being introduced more effectively to tackle illegal posters and flyers as sources of litter.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Section 39 allows local authorities to make general anti-litter by-laws for their areas. Under existing litter legislation, local authorities can only make by-laws to prohibit or regulate the distribution of advertising material to the public. This is an important new power and I hope that all local authorities will consider it when implementing their by-laws. I also hope they will see it as an opportunity to drive forward their ambitious plans to ensure the environment in their areas is presented in the best possible light.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Section 40 increases the fines, and introduces conviction on indictment, for litter offences. With regard to summary conviction, the current fine will be increased from €1,900 to a maximum of €3,000. The section also provides for the introduction of conviction on indictment for litter offences, with a maximum fine of €130,000 and a corresponding maximum fine of €10,000 per day for continuing offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The Bill brings our national legislation fully into line with one of the more important EU instruments for environmental policy – the IPPC directive. However, it does more than that. The opportunity is taken to make significant progress in a range of critical areas across the environmental agenda. The Bill modernises the law governing EPA licensing generally, provides an enhanced focus for the EPA to secure energy efficiency from licensable activities and empowers it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. The Bill also gives public authorities important new powers in relation to the implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation and makes important changes to the legislative codes relating to litter, particularly waste management.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_118">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_192">While welcoming the Minister to the House, I wish to protest in the strongest terms that this Bill is being dealt with less than a week after its publication. Given the complexity of the content and the fact that we lack the resources available to the Minister, it is unrealistic to expect the necessary research to be completed within such a short period. Such undue haste is not in anybody's best interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">One of the most disturbing aspects of the Bill is the proposal to give city and county managers the power to impose charges for waste collection, making it a purely executive function and removing control from elected public representatives. Local councillors, who are sensitive to the needs of the public, will no longer have any function in deciding household waste charges or regional waste management plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Local self-government is the basis of democracy and the arena in which people can participate, but this fact is being ignored by the Minister. The Local Government Act 2001, in which it was promised that elected representatives' commitment of service to the community would be strengthened, is also being ignored. By doing so, the Government will remove power from the democratically elected local representatives and transfer it to managers who are not answerable to the public. The proposal will effectively emasculate local authority members and the voice of the people they represent will be silenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">If passed, this legislation will give city and county managers power to impose increased waste charges unilaterally. Whether a decision is taken to charge householders by weight or other measures are put in place, local elected representatives will be powerless to intervene. Already this year we have seen some local authorities forced to increase their charges by over 30% because they have been left with serious shortfalls due to Government cutbacks. Once again, the public is being asked to make up for the serious mismanagement of public funds by the Government. How much further can the public purse be expected to stretch to prop up the financial ineptitude of the Minister for Finance who has grossly misled the public and seriously squandered public resources?</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The Bill will give explicit powers to local authorities to cease collecting domestic waste from households which have not paid the imposed charges, overturning a Supreme Court judgment of 2001 which ruled that they did not have the power to do so. The Supreme Court judgment did not challenge the right of local authorities to levy charges but its effect was that they could only recover unpaid charges as normal contract debt except where charges were waived in cases of financial hardship. The only function left to elected local representatives in this matter is to vote against the annual budgets. This would mean risking abolition, as threatened by the Minister during votes on the budgets of many local authorities before Christmas.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_198">The Bill also proposes that the power to adopt waste management plans will be permanently given to city and county managers. This proposal was controversially introduced as a temporary measure in April 2001 to attempt to overcome opposition by some local councils. If the Bill is passed, consumers will be at the mercy of their local county manager who can impose charges at will without consultation or any democratic input. Where do these proposals leave the Government's talk of strengthening local democracy in the lead-up to the 2004 local elections? I presume these are more empty words.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">With every man, woman and child in the State now producing approximately 600 kg of waste per year – an increase of 60% since the Celtic tiger boom commenced in 1995 – we undoubtedly have a waste disposal crisis. Action is urgently needed but hitting the public yet again with backdoor taxation is both unrealistic and grossly unfair. What is needed is real reform of the funding structures for local authorities, not piecemeal add-ons, and value for money for the customer. Re-education and the policy of zero waste would remove the need for measures such as incinceration, which is a highly controversial issue. To cope with the waste disposal crisis, promotion of the acceptance of re-using and recycling of residual waste is urgently needed. Councillors are committed to safe handling, effective recycling and environmentally sound disposal of waste products—</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_203">The Minister should check any of our county development plans put together and adopted by public representatives. Elected members are dedicated to providing superior customer service, seeking out innovative solutions to waste management issues and implementing technological procedures with a strong commitment to environmental stewardship. Yesterday the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, called on the Minister to make provision for an ongoing subsidy fund of €150 million per annum for ten years for recycling of domestic waste. Deputy Bruton said:</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Just as some form of ongoing public subsidy for public transport is allowed in the general interest, I believe that an ongoing public subsidy for recycling should also be allowed. Capital grants alone are not enough because recycling is loss making on a year-on-year basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The Bill's defining of the Environmental Protection Agency's integrated pollution control licensing system to bring it into line with the EU directive on integrated pollution prevention and control is to be broadly welcomed. We must, as a matter of urgency, place greater emphasis on pollution prevention and minimise environmental problems at source. We are reaching a crisis in waste management and it is obvious that the present measures are ineffective. The European Commission has been a major driver of environmental reform and Ireland a somewhat reluctant conformer, often having to be faced with court action before adopting EU directives. Almost every piece of progressive environmental legislation passed during the term of the Government has resulted from direct intervention by the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Our recent economic boom has not only affected the increase in household waste it has also affected the environment in almost every area, including rivers, lakes, groundwater, ambient air and drinking water. Economic growth has accelerated pressures on the environment. It has effected pollution of inland waters, growing waste mountains, increased traffic in urban areas, soaring greenhouse gas emissions and the exploitation of natural resources. Ireland urgently needs a modern waste management infrastructure to address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">While recognising that urgent action is needed in the area of waste disposal and other environmental issues covered by the proposed Bill, the resulting attack on the democratic process, which the Government considers it can bypass, is not acceptable. The Minister must look at what ails the system and how to rescue it from decline. Democracy is not for sale and certainly not to be used as a tool in the Government's frantic attempts to cover up its gross mismanagement of public funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">When the Minister was in the House before Christmas to debate the Social Housing Bill, he talked in great detail about reforming that legislation, which was only in place for two years. He said he took the views of local authorities which had made representation to him into consideration. I would like to know who has requested this legislation. Did the request come from the County and City Managers Association? It certainly did not come from the local authority representatives associations. Is the measure sought by officials of the Minister's Department in order to dismantle local government in the future? I hope the Minister will respond to these questions. I totally reject the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_209">I welcome the Minister. I strongly support the Bill and what the Minister has said about it on radio and television. He has mentioned the need for strong action, with which I agree totally. He has also commented that legislation alone will not improve the environment, which is true.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">In my time on the Council of Europe I was a member of the science and technology committee and we spent much time looking at the question of pollution. It is interesting to consider the efforts made by each country to prevent pollution. There are good examples of positive steps being taken. There are also examples of some governments in Europe saying they would have it stated in their constitutions that everyone is entitled to fresh air and a good environment. That is not enough. Some of the places to which I refer were affected by smog problems similar to those experienced in Dublin in the late 1980s before the then Minister of State and current Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, took action. This is a salutary lesson which shows that legislation must be introduced and the necessary decisions taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Last week I visited Iraq with Deputy Michael Higgins. There will be an opportunity to debate that issue tomorrow. In relation to the environment and pollution in that country, a friend took us to a restaurant and said the food was very good but not to eat fish caught in the local river because of the pollution. This shows that pollution can affect even our eating habits.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">There are a number of areas I want to mention in regard to the environment and pollution. The first concerns water supplies. In some areas water supplies have become so polluted that it is only now we are now dealing with issues that should have been dealt with many years ago. All credit must go to the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and other Ministers who have taken decisions on water supplies.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The last report on water supplies in County Galway, where there is a huge number of group water schemes, referred to some pollution from septic tanks and agricultural activity. It is important to move to a situation where all water supplies come from local authority sources. For too long we have had supplies from rivers, springs and lakes and they have not been successful. All the studies carried out show that those supplies have been polluted. While I accept that this issue is being addressed by the Minister, I hope further action will be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">While quarrying is an activity I do not particularly like, it has to be carried out under proper planning and strict guidelines. There should be more monitoring of the actual quarrying that takes place, because a great deal of damage has been done. I have taken up many complaints with the local authority and the Department regarding the way in which areas are left completely destroyed, roads damaged and water supplies affected. That area could also be looked under the heading of environmental control.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">During my term on the Council of Europe, I was impressed by the concept of separating waste. In Ireland we are beginning to tackle this issue. I listened to the Minister on radio this morning speaking about further grants to be announced for recycling. In County Galway, Rehab has done wonderful work in providing facilities in towns and small villages for the disposal of drinking cans and bottles. We have not made sufficient progress regarding the disposal of paper and much remains to be done in this area. Some of the larger towns have centres to which old clothes can be brought. If we obtain the grants to which the Minister referred, a major change can be made in the way we deal with waste disposal. Some European airports have different compartments for paper, drinking cans, bottles and so on. However, such progress has not been made in Ireland because facilities of this type are not provided at our airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Some marvellous schemes have been initiated in our schools. The green flag is a coveted award which schools seek to have bestowed upon them. Great credit is due to An Taisce for its work with schools. That organisation has come in for much criticism from this House, the lower House and people throughout the country in relation to planning objections. However, it has done great work with primary and second level schools, the students and teachers of which have worked hard to win green flag status.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Wonderful work has been done by schools not only in terms of tackling the litter problem but also in respect of recycling. There are wormeries in schools and many beautiful products are being made from the recycled materials. Children have done this work at school but perhaps they do not see the same principle applying at home or when walking along the streets of their towns. This good work will have to be built on and hopefully, with the Minister's commitment to further recycling, we can obtain the necessary funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I was interested in what the Minister stated about the polluter pays principle. He was absolutely correct in what he has said. For too long people have been subsidising their neighbours. It makes sense that people should pay for a service that is provided. In some cases two neighbours are using the same service or, perhaps, another neighbour's service and that should not happen. It is important that the legislation clearly provides that people are levied for the use of the service. The Supreme Court judgment, which found that local authorities did not have the right to charge, was wrong and the matter will now be put right in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">On the issue of refuse collection, many counties have privatised the system and it is working well. I am aware that in Dublin there was a debate on charges for larger and smaller bins and I understand a waiver system applies in some local authority areas. We have now reached a situation where there have been problems with the privatised system in relation to charges. I have spoken to some of those who operate these systems. When I refer to the fact that charges have increased substantially in some counties, they say that local authorities are charging extra for the use of tipheads. This has caused many problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Some private sector companies are applying for landfill sites at the same time that local authorities are drawing up county development plans and designating proposed landfill sites. In County Galway, Celtic Waste has applied for planning permission for a particular site while the local authority has three sites and will select one with a view to establishing a landfill site for southern Connacht. I understand there are to be two landfill sites in Connacht. Perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach can tell the House where the site for Mayo will be located.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">I understood counties Mayo and Galway would deal with it when the planning process was complete. If private developers can quickly obtain planning permission and are in a position to operate, will they be able to provide a site for both the county and the region? It will be interesting to see what happens when the planning process is developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I hope that more of the type of recycling centres used at shopping centres in Spain and Portugal will be put in place at shopping centres here, which are responsible for generating large amounts of litter. The Minister spoke about shopping trolleys as well. In the past one saw fliers left on cars outside shops, cinemas or supermarkets. I think there was legislation to deal with that but this legislation is stronger.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">There have been problems with litter but, on the plus side, we have a very successful tidy towns competition. Every town and village gets a mark each year when they enter the competition and they like to see whether they have improved on that mark. There is a prize for every county and region and communities like to improve their situation. The presentation of prizes is one of the loveliest occasions I have attended. It usually takes place in Roscommon or Mayo – in our region. It is a source of pride to communities when they are able to say their mark has gone up and they can move on to other projects. Some very good projects have come out of the tidy towns competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Many recycling centres set up in towns and villages do not deal with paper. There are perhaps security and safety reasons for that. Could the newspaper industry do a bit more? There was a question of bringing papers to the Rehab centres in Galway. Pat Kenny put the question this morning as to whether the newspaper industry would take newspapers back when people are finished with them. I do not know whether it would. There should be a better system of disposing of paper. Students in schools have looked at ways to deal with the disposal of plastic containers. That is another area where more funding and direction is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I welcome this legislation and I am glad the Minister has dealt with the 2001 Supreme Court judgment. That is the most immediate issue which has got the most attention in the media. I hope this Bill passes quickly through the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_229">I welcome the Bill, which is appropriate. It is, by and large, a good Bill and I agree with most of its sections. My only problem is that it does not seem to go quite far enough. I recognise that it implements an EU directive of 1996, so it is something we are required to do and the Minister is being a good European by doing so. I am in favour of virtually all the provisions of the Bill but my only problem is that I am not sure of the extent to which enforceability is ensured in it. All this means absolutely nothing unless and until it is enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I do not entirely agree with Senator Bannon because I believe councils all over the country have been in dereliction of their duty. I am glad we have a Minister who is prepared to take them on, particularly with regard to waste disposal. There is a very clear principle involved and it is not BATNEEC – it is NIMBY, not in my back yard. Each council wants to shift the responsibility from one area to another. That is because councillors are responding to the pressures of local politics – they want to get re-elected and to secure their political careers – but that is not good enough in terms of what amounts to a national waste crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">I know I will make myself very unpopular and lose votes when I say there is a case for incineration. I would like to see this country move to the highest possible level of recycling, which I think can be as high as 80% or 90%, but there will still be that intractable fraction. Other countries use incineration. Denmark is frequently cited and it has a considerable number of incinerators. Canada also has incinerators. Why not use the best available technology in this circumstance to get rid of waste?</p>
          <p eId="para_232">At the moment we are being as hypocritical about this as we were in the past about abortion – we are exporting the problem. I understand – perhaps the Minister will confirm this – we export certain amounts of hazardous waste to other European countries. We are simply off loading the problem on to them. It is time we grew up as adults and dealt with our own problems. I am glad the Minister is taking this on board and I congratulate him on doing so.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_236">That is shameful. We have to grow up and deal with it. If the local councils will not deal with waste for their own small political reasons, then it is right and appropriate that these powers should be transferred to the manager or to the Minister because, as a country, we have to be good neighbours and be responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I greatly regret the collapse of the Irish Glass Bottle Company, partly because I knew that area of Dublin very well when I was younger. I used to walk the dogs along the strand. The IGBC was a real part of old Dublin and it is a great pity that with its collapse we have lost a certain element of recycling, even though I heard the Minister say on radio this morning that it is part of an all-Ireland solution and that we can still export to the North of Ireland, but we are dependent on it for a facility over which we have no control. I wish there had been another possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I am all in favour of recycling but we should keep an eye on these facilities – the bottle banks and the recycling bins. They are obviously not cleared frequently enough and there are occasions in which they create their own little pool of pollution around the facility. That is a very bad advertisement, particularly for young people. They see something which is supposed to be green, environmentally friendly and so forth but it is simply creating further waste, mess and rubbish. I have seen this not only in Dublin but also in a number of provincial towns and it is a great pity.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">There has been a proliferation of dumps with hazardous waste around the country. In the last session I drew the attention of the House to a serious situation, particularly in Wicklow where there seemed to be an explosion of these dumps with enormous deposits of waste. Some of these dumps contained hazardous hospital material. That is simply not tolerable and the people responsible should be pursued vigorously.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">I deplore the attack yesterday on a decent RTÉ reporter, Ciarán Mullooly, who was in Roscommon going about his legitimate business investigating this. He had film in his camera showing an illegal dump but he was attacked and the camera was taken from him and thrown into some kind of slurry pit. I hope those people will be prosecuted. That is not something a decent community can support.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I was glad to hear Senator Kitt, and I congratulate him on his return from Baghdad. I know, because I had the experience there two years ago, how sad the pollution situation is that city. I was very glad to hear him give some praise to An Taisce on its green policy in schools and on the educational projects in which it is involved. He mentioned that it has come under considerable criticism for the number of objections it is supposed to have lodged. It was accused of objecting to almost every planning application in the county of Leitrim, for example. That is simply not true – it is a big lie. There were about 9,000 planning applications last year and the number of objections from An Taisce was in single figures. It is about time we nailed this kind of lie and I glad Senator Kitt gave some degree of praise to An Taisce.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">There is a very serious problem with regard to packaging. We are an over-packaged consumer society and something should be done about that. There should be legislation to ensure it is either recyclable or biodegradable. Senator Kitt raised the question of bottles. Why do we not make a start on plastic bottles in the same way as we did with plastic bags? Everybody has said how successful that measure was. It was marvellous, although there was a lot of groaning about it when it was introduced. People now accept it and it has had a huge and immediate impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">There is a significant omission from the Bill, but perhaps the Minister will be able to reassure the House that he will bring forward legislation to deal with it. As far as I am aware, the legislation contains nothing about carbon fuel taxes. Such taxes will be required to deal with greenhouse gas emissions. I know this would have an effect on the economy, but it is something to which we will have to face up. Ireland's greenhouse gas emission levels are way over the limits set by the Kyoto protocols. If we are going to live up to those protocols, we had better start preparing now before the introduction of fines for exceeding the limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">In my opinion, some kind of collection facilities should be provided for the disposal of batteries, including those used to power portable radio sets.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The Minister stated: "The new section 83(5) changes the technical basis of the licensing system from best available technology not entailing excessive costs – BATNEEC – to best available techniques – BAT." This involves a kind of massaging where the Minister is seeking to reassure industry that the change will not be too difficult. I hope it will still bite and that we are moving towards the use of best available technology. I am sure the Minister intended to reassure industry, but I am somewhat concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Problems arise with the creation of tail ponds from mineral exploration, as well as from the dumping of animal waste and milk products. We know that such material has often been dumped into rivers and lakes and resulted in enormous fish kills.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">The display of advertisements on private houses should be examined, particularly when they are protected list 1 houses. For example – I am being parochial here – there are two huge advertisement hoardings in North Great George's Street, despite the fact that every house in the street is a list 1 building. That is not appropriate and it should be examined by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">As regards advertising on cars, I rather like the advertising on New York taxis and I see that some Irish taxis are beginning to carry them also. In my view such advertisements brighten up the vehicles.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">Before handing over to Senator Quinn, I wish to refer to two matters. First, the idea of transferring the burden of proof to the polluter is excellent; the polluter should pay. Second, I understand what the Minister is doing with regard to refuse collection in terms of trying to overturn the Supreme Court judgment. However, what about the neighbours? If my neighbour does not pay his or her bill, why should I suffer the pollution? That is the real problem which will have to be addressed because it is not fair. If I have a lousy neighbour, why should I have to put up with the terribly offensive smell from his or her uncollected rubbish? The authorities should pursue such people and fine them. By and large, the bin service is quite good but there are occasions when that is not the case. The Minister should look at what happens in Parnell Street when things are just dumped in the middle of the road. I refer here to the fact that refuse bags can burst which leads to rubbish being blown across the road.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">The user pays concept is essential, but I not sure the Bill emphasises that in the case of household rubbish. I realise that in section 35 the Minister has made provision for taking into account the type and volume of waste, which is essential. If a local authority does not judge the amount of rubbish from individual households, that is the same as making it free because everybody, whether they have a lot of rubbish or only a little, will be obliged to pay the same amount. It is essential that a provision to deal with this problem is included in the legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_261">I know it is in section 35, but I did not see the emphasis being placed on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I was on the board of Repak for some time and one of the problems with which we were faced was newspaper, which is not packaging. Newspapers around Europe have gathered together to ensure they do not make a contribution to any recycling efforts. They claim that if they ever did so, it would set a standard which says "We are responsible for having to recycle the product produced". A newspaper in Flanders in Belgium did so once, but the other newspapers asked it to stop. There is plenty of legislation for the recycling of packaging, but not for products. As a result, newspapers are anxious to protect what they produce being regarded as packaging.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Since the Bill is not just about rubbish and incineration, I have a question about the longer term. The success of the plastic bag levy was such that the public changed its attitude and behaviour. That was because the previous Minister, Deputy Dempsey, listened carefully to the concerns of those of us in the affected businesses. On each occasion we had a problem, the Department found a way to overcome it and so the levy has been a success. I urge the Minister to make sure there is a wide debate in this area. I know he will listen to the concerns that are expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">If we return to using glass bottles, they will have to be delivered, collected and cleaned and deposits will have to be paid on them. The damage to the environment of all that waste of energy has to be taken into account and I am sure it will be. I know such a system will not necessarily be imposed without taking these considerations into account, but in other countries I have seen the huge difficulties that can arise over taking deposits. Such bottles have to be cleaned and transported, which uses energy, and a health issue also arises. We will have to tackle such problems through discussions with the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The Minister referred to supermarket trolleys, for which I was reluctant to force customers to pay. However, we were eventually embarrassed into doing so when two of our trolleys were found on the road and we were accused, quite rightly, of littering. We were guilty because we had allowed customers to take trolleys off the supermarket premises and they had been left by the roadside. Eventually, we grasped the nettle – as the Minister is now doing – and put a refundable deposit charge on the trolleys. We came up with the idea of providing a token for customers to use, although we could not be too generous with it because the system would be abused. The charging system for supermarket trolleys has been accepted, although it required a campaign to convince the public to take such steps. Members of the public may not like it, as happened initially with the plastic bag levy, but when they see the benefits they appreciate them.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The Bill will give power to local authority executives regarding payment for the amount of domestic waste produced. We must grasp that fact, just as the European Union has recognised that water must be paid for by the amount that is used. We are being forced into that practice and while we may not like it, we will eventually recognise that the user must pay. If one uses very little water, one will not pay much, whereas if one uses a lot of money, the cost will be higher. While the Minister does not intend it to happen, local councils will charge everybody the same amount for the collection of domestic waste unless we find a way of enforcing a different system. A neighbour of mine produces very little domestic rubbish because she lives on her own. However, her container is quite big and she has to pay the same amount as everyone else, even though we may produce more waste. We should insist on the user pays principle being applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The Minster has met the challenge through this Bill, which is well worthy of support, although in certain areas it may be more a question of emphasis. I know this enabling Bill will help the Minister achieve a great deal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I welcome the Minister. The fact that this Bill is being introduced in the Seanad is in keeping with the tradition of Bills of this nature. The Environmental Protection Agency Bill 1992 was introduced here by the then Minister, Deputy Harney. I commend the Minister on the remarks he made this morning on radio when dealing with the Bill. A statement was made in the subsequent discussion that this was the first step but it is not. There has been successive legislation over the past 12 years, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, Waste Management Acts, litter Bills and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">This generation has been responsible for a great deal of environmental degradation, deliberate and significant damage to the environment. We have many tribunals and inquiries into what happened ten or 15 years ago with regard to planning. One wonders what we will look back on in 20 years' time and say was wrong. I believe the next generation will blame us for the way we have mis-treated and damaged the environment, degraded our lakes, rivers and sensitive areas. It is time to call a halt.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">There is a suggestion that we are dilatory in adopting European directives. There is substance to that, but it is notable that in this case we are dealing with a 1996 directive. By the standards of previous Administrations it is a reasonably rapid response for which we cannot be criticised.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Apart from the moral imperative with regard to protection of the environment, another aspect which is frequently lost sight of is the great economic imperative. We depend heavily on tourism and the promotion of clean air, water and the environment not just for tourism but for our agriculture and food industries. Even if we were not convinced on moral grounds, as we should be, there is a great economic imperative to get these matters right and ensure they are done properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">In his remarks on 30 January the Minister spoke about the tough decisions that are necessary. He is correct in that. There are tough decisions to be made and it is unquestionably the case that the members of local authorities have not been prepared to make them. I say that as a member of a local authority, albeit one that the Minister will soon remove from that position. However, that is a debate for another day. Kildare County Council, of which I am a member, was faced with serious increases this year in bin charges. If we come back to the principle of the polluter pays, which I believe is an absolute, there is no choice in these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I live close to the Kildare County Council landfill site and I know that it is flaring off gases into the atmosphere 24 hours a day. Hopefully, some of that will be recovered by way of waste to energy, which is something on which we could make progress. Ground water pollution emanates from a time when liners were not put into the bottom of landfill sites. The gases are flared off. They infiltrated the strata underneath to the point where people had to be evacuated from their houses at Christmas and put into rented accommodation. If the wind is in the right direction you can smell the gases three or four miles away.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">There is a cost. In this case it is borne by the local community. It is not visible but it is a cost nonetheless and we must ensure that local communities do not have to bear it. If we can do that, while we may not remove the difficulties we have with the "not in my back yard" principle, much of them would be ameliorated. Local authority members must accept their responsibilities and acknowledge there are costs involved that must be met and not, as we had in Kildare County Council, have a debate that goes on for a day with lots of rhetoric about the need to protect the environment. At the end of the day you must put your money where your mouth is. Unfortunately, for populist reasons, many people are not prepared to do that and it is time they were shown up for what they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">With regard to the executive function on waste management, I agree with the Minister. If it can be shown that local authority members will not make those decisions the Minister is right. We talk about subsidiarity and devolved powers. It is my experience that when powers are devolved members will not use them. We have been fudging the issue of taxis in my county for two years because people will not make hard decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">I am less with the Minister on the question of charges. Perhaps members should be responsible for that but I accept the principle that if we are not prepared to make hard decisions they must be made by the executive. The Minister is correct in saying that someone somewhere pays. If I pay a bin charge why should I pick up the cost for the person beside me who does not do so?</p>
          <p eId="para_277">In my county there is not much incentive to recycle. I recycle as much as I can – newspapers, bottles, plastic and batteries. I live in a rural area and I put it in my car and bring it to the dump. There is a cost to me but I am prepared to meet it. There is no encouragement to help me meet that cost. If the charge were on the amount of waste I produce rather than a one off charge irrespective of whether I fill my bin every week, there would be more of an incentive.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I commend Kildare County Council on the great strides it has made in improving the dump, making sure it is better managed and that there are proper facilities there. I can bring small volumes of agricultural chemicals, which are a major problem in terms of their disposal, and they can be disposed of there. Some 30% of the weight of the waste going into the Kildare County Council landfill site in the recent past was paper. That is not by volume but by weight and is a vast amount. There is a large commercial facility for shredding documents which works very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Several Members mentioned packaging. I recently bought a computer. It was in a large box inside which was styrofoam to stop it from moving about, plastic bags containing all the pieces to be added on to it and a solid plastic piece inside the machine to stop it shaking. If you want to recycle the packaging you must separate out five different elements. The annual report of Kildare County Council, which promotes recycling, has a glossy hard cover on the front and back with glossy dividers at intervals and spiral binding. If you want to recycle that you must separate three elements. We do not think these issues through in the way we should.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The Minister is correct when he mentions matters being done on a regional basis. When one drives around the country it is extraordinary to see that the signs are never opposed to a dump, it is always a super dump. Perhaps the Minister will say if there is such a thing as an ordinary dump or if it is proposed to have super dumps everywhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">With regard to incineration, and I say this with some scientific training, there is much less potential for pollution and less threat to human health from incineration than from landfill. It is difficult to get that message across. We had a major campaign in north Kildare when there was a proposal to build an incinerator in Kilcock. Like the super dump, there is no such thing as an incinerator, it is always a toxic incinerator. One would think that everything being incinerated is toxic material, which it is not. We can separate toxic material from other materials.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The other point relates to the whole question of BATNEEC, an opt-out for local authorities, in particular. A limit must be set because one cannot allow an open cheque book in this regard. The term BATNEEC has been used not to do things that should have been done. It must be acknowledged that local authorities have been serious polluters. In much legislation during the years there has been an opt-out for local authorities. Everyone else is required to obey the law bar the local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">With regard to the River Liffey, a very sensitive and important national resource, there is a view among the technical staff of local authorities that it is a source of water and a place to dispose of waste. It is not sustainable to keep taking more and more water out of Ballymore Eustace in order that it can be wasted in Dublin where, if there is a cold night, people leave taps on and let the water run without being penalised. Someone somewhere pays. Those responsible for wasting water should have to pay. Perhaps that is a matter for wider debate for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">In regard to the problem of litter, reference was made to the effect of charging for plastic bags, which has been hugely beneficial to an extent which might not have been thought possible at first. I would like to proclaim Dardis's first law of take-away. Dardis's first law of take-away states, "The average family in the average motor car, travelling at average speed, consumes one take-away in a mile and a half". I have tested this hypothesis at some length and been in a position to verify it on the basis that my house is a mile and a half from three take-aways, and I know styrofoam from them is disposed of outside my gate. It seems incredible that styrofoam is still being used as containers for some foods. At least paper will rot but styrofoam does not and blows all over the place. There are responsibilities in that regard also.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I agree with the Minister in regard to the fit person, which is very important. There was a case not too far from where I live, near the Pollardstown Fen on which there was huge public concern about the effect of the motorway, rightly so. This has been rectified. However, there was a dump within yards of the fen and, despite the determination of the local authority and the EPA to end it, it took an enormous length of time to get the matter through the courts and the various orders complied with. There must be an effective system whereby when matters are brought to public attention, or are discovered by vigilant county council officials or EPA personnel, something can be done immediately to stop people who persist in this type of activity from continuing in business, in the same way directors of public companies who commit an offence can be disqualified from their directorship.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">As Senator Norris said, some matters must be dealt with on an international basis. Where toxic materials are concerned, it may be that the only way the costs of a facility can be met is on an international basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I am pleased that promoters of events are being dealt with. While the ploughing match this year was a great event, a particular national newspaper distributed free copies every morning to those going into the event and in the evening the hedges were covered with newspapers. I do not particularly hold the National Ploughing Association culpable because it runs a good operation and cleans up after the event. However, the fact that a national newspaper had plastic bags available for those going into the ploughing match should be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I agree with the Minister in regard to dealing with the potential effects of the processing industry. Milk is a highly toxic material and, as watercourses can do enormous damage, this issue needs to be attended to. At the end of the day, we must realise it is our community, our country and our responsibility to hand on to the next generation something we want to have for ourselves.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_289">I welcome the Minister and commend him on first bringing this legislation to the Seanad. As Senator Dardis pointed out, quite a record has been established of allowing Senators to have the first say on environmental legislation, which I welcome. There is much to be welcomed in this legislation and I look forward to an in-depth examination of it in the coming weeks. Unfortunately, it provides for a very regrettable diminution and undermining of local democracy. In that context, we cannot support the provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">I suppose one will ask how can anyone oppose, in principle, a Bill called the Protection of the Environment Bill. If it was purely about that, I would have no difficulty with it. However, it has been one of the singular failures of Government, and public administration in general, that we should have landed ourselves in this situation in 2003. We have a serious waste crisis. There is a major pollution problem in our rivers, streams and lakes, which are effectively dead as a result of pollution. There is the very difficult issue of illegal dumping, which has clearly been ongoing for a number of years. We have never managed to raise the levels of recycling material above very small figures. We have an increasing and very difficult litter problem, which is having a very bad effect on our towns and tourism industry. We have not tackled our responsibilities in regard to reducing waste and the amount of material being placed in landfill, and not advanced alternative safe technologies which have the confidence of the public. Instead, there are irreconcilable differences, which emerge at local authority and local community level, in particular, where populism is blamed for causing our waste problems. I would like to set the record straight on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">It is not populism which has caused a waste crisis but a failure to tackle the waste problem. It is time to say the regional waste management structures which we have attempted to put in place have not worked. The facts are there to prove this. Landfills, on which there is still almost complete reliance, are rapidly filling. There is a problem with pollution and low levels of recycling. It seems impossible to reduce the amount of waste being produced while there is huge resistance on the part of the public to pay waste charges. This is all blamed on politicians and called populism. I will return to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">I will now deal with the elements of the Bill which I welcome, including the role of the EPA. While listing all the failures, perhaps one of the few successes is the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and the work it has carried out. While the Bill is a response to an EU directive, the manner in which it is framed and the proposals contained therein in regard to the EPA and the licensing system are to be welcomed. There are some good elements in the Bill, which are not included in the directive but are the Minister's proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">In regard to the EPA and the role of local authorities, I would like to touch on one example in the north Tipperary area. The Environmental Protection Agency took an initiative at an early stage of a huge environmental problem. It was a proper response to the huge environmental difficulties faced by the community of Silvermines, when a mining company left a tailings management facility in a state that caused an environmental hazard in the area. Some members of the community and I contacted the EPA in 1999 following a number of animal deaths in the area. There were concerns that the tailings facility was being used for purposes other than those for which it was intended. The EPA responded to our concerns rapidly and a report was published on the matter. Following consideration of the report by the local authority and the EPA, action was taken against those concerned and an inter-agency group was established. The group has conducted extraordinarily good work in relation to environmental pollution arising from the mining experiences in the Silvermines area.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">A consultant's report on the matter was published by the former Department of Marine and Natural Resources in March 2002. It revealed a worrying level of toxicity and environmental pollution on five sites in the Silvermines area. The report appears to be bogged down, however, by the question of whether the Department has the power to act and difficulties in acquiring the funding required. The EPA should be driving forward the rehabilitation and remediation of former mining sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to reflect on the importance of this issue. The Department informed me this morning that there is deadlock in relation to the rehabilitation of the tailings site, in particular, as well as the other sites. I know that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is not directly responsible for this matter, but I put it to him that the question of what will happen next at Silvermines is a major environmental issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">We need an agency, with powers similar to those of the EPA, that will take a proactive approach to this type of problem. Such an agency should be able to lead legal action, where necessary, and should have the resources to ensure that former mining sites, some of which date back to the 1840s, are rehabilitated and made environmentally safe, which is not the case at present. Having seen at first hand that the EPA acts effectively where it can, I would welcome a strengthening of its powers. Its role should be enhanced so that it can deal with all major environmental problems and I suggest that this could be done under the terms of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I welcome the "fit and proper person" provision in relation to licences contained in this legislation, as it is long overdue. Many communities will welcome this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I realise that Senator Dardis is not in the House – perhaps he is listening to me in his office – but I would like to discuss the topic of superdumps to which he referred. Having been involved in a campaign against a proposed dump in County Tipperary, I appreciate that one should not immediately jump to conclusions when one sees posters proclaiming that a community is against proposals to provide a site for such a commercial waste management facility in the locality. A proposal to locate such a facility in the Silvermines area was not accepted as the suggested site was entirely unsuitable. It was prone to subsidence and it would have been an unsafe location for a superdump. While media attention will focus on the resistance of communities to large waste management facilities, the EPA or local authorities will reject applications for such facilities for legitimate reasons, such as environmental or planning issues. The fact that the decision may have little to do with the feelings of the local community bears witness to the nature of our planning laws and the licensing system. The community in north Tipperary will stand over the role of the planning authorities and the EPA in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The well-run landfill in north Tipperary is managed by the local authority. The community near the site deserves to be applauded for the manner in which it has co-operated with the county council. Not only has the landfill been extended, but until recently it was used as the dump for County Clare when that county found itself without landfill capacity. North Tipperary County Council was willing to help in that instance, but such assistance is not the answer to landfill problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">One of the difficulties resulting from our failure to reduce the amount of waste being dumped in landfill sites is that such sites have become major commercial operations. They are run by local authorities at present, but one can imagine that they will be run by private operators in future. There is an incentive for landfill operators to generate more income by encouraging the generation of more waste. There is little incentive, on the other hand, for recycling. My home town is in the fortunate position of having a recycling box outside every house, but this country is failing to create incentives for consumers and companies to recycle. We will not reach our recycling targets if we do not offer real incentives, such as tax breaks, to recycling facilities. People want to recycle – they are happy to take bottles and cans to recycling centres – but the recycling industry will not reach the necessary level without a major push and the attachment of major incentives.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I agree with Senator Dardis and others in relation to the amount of paper we, as public representatives, see used. I am aware of individuals in other organisations who encounter similar problems. It should be entirely unacceptable for glossy magazines to be wrapped in plastic, just as it is no longer acceptable for fast food restaurants to use styrofoam. We need to be vigilant in relation to how we proceed so we can reduce the amount of waste that is produced.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Packaging is a huge problem, as everything one buys seems to be surrounded by a large amount of plastic or other non-recyclable material. This runs contrary to this country's stated ambition of reducing the amount of waste that is generated. I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on the fact that as we have become more prosperous as a nation, we have produced more waste. Does it follow automatically that a prosperous country should produce so much waste?</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I agree. We need to tackle our waste management problems in a more reasonable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The fact that litter is having detrimental effects on tourism has been mentioned, but pollution is also damaging that industry. One only need look at Lough Derg, which has been unsuitable for fishing for an unacceptably long number of years. While attempts are being made to restock the lake, serious problems are still being encountered as a result of the high level of phosphorus running into it from various streams. This poisonous run-off can be attributed, in part, to the agriculture industry. North Tipperary County Council has not been afraid to deal with this issue. It introduced by-laws based entirely on scientific evidence that demonstrates the need to reduce the amount of fertiliser used on the land. The timeframe in place is so long that one wonders whether we will ever meet our targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I am looking forward to an in-depth discussion of this legislation. Much contained within it is to be welcomed but unfortunately it also provides for such a serious diminution of the role of the public representative and local authorities that it must be opposed at that level.</p>

        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_308">I wish to share five minutes of my time with Senator Ormonde.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">I welcome the Minister and the publication of the Bill. I congratulate the Minister and his Department on grasping the nettle and taking on this sometimes emotive but extremely important issue – pollution prevention and control. The thrust of the Bill is to bring the 1992 and 1996 Acts into line with legislation in the rest of the European Union using the best available techniques. It is a balanced Bill – it balances enforcement with protection. That is the key to how prevention and control can be implemented. While it increases the fines and strengthens the requirements for an applicant to be a fit and proper person, it still maintains a number of safeguards such as the new provision for an objector to request an oral hearing. This is most important to many communities. My own experience in the city, where quite a number of issues have arisen regarding waste disposal and the control of pollution, was that much of the hysteria was generated purely for political reasons. The controls included in the Bill ensure this is tackled head on.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">The changes at local authority level are very welcome. Dublin has had a problem for the last two or three years at city council level, as the Minister knows, in that it could not strike a rate. This was because members of the smaller parties did not want to go out and tell people that they would have to pay if they wanted a playground in their flat complex or new windows in their senior citizens' home. Good money could not be thrown after bad in trying to maintain a whole system of pollution control. The culture is changing. Huge advances are being made, particularly at school level. There is an amazing programme called Green Schools which has been a huge success.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_151">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_311">It is an excellent programme.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_312">My own children come home and give out to me if I throw out a newspaper and they separate rubbish. That is a cultural change. If one had said five years ago that we would have wheelie bins in Dublin and people would be separating their waste automatically, one would have been laughed at. This is how the Bill balances enforcement with encouragement to comply with regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I also welcome the enhancement of the role of the EPA. The agency is a body of which one only hears when there is a crisis. Nobody hears of the work it does on a day-to-day basis protecting individuals, companies, farmers and so on. The new powers, for instance, to revoke or suspend licences or require a landfill operator to levy charges are all enhancements of powers the agency already has – it may provide explicitly for court orders where waste activity is carried on other than in accordance with any requisite authorisation. The licensing of waste disposal is something that must be tackled in the immediate future.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The strengthening of the provisions of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 and the imposition of greater restrictions on advertising material in public places are to be welcomed. As politicians, we all experience at election time postering and fly-postering, which, particularly in Dublin city, are practised outside of election times by political parties and individuals. They stick up posters which may have no name or contact number and are left there for months on end. They rot and fall down but no action is taken. Even at election time, certain individuals and groups put up posters at night in order that there is no way of knowing who is responsible. Political parties are fined if they are a couple of weeks late in removing posters but no action is taken against the people concerned. This must be dealt with. I welcome this provision in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">There is a provision in the Bill dealing with transboundary environmental impact. This is a huge issue: everybody has been talking about major catastrophes for the last few weeks. We could very easily suffer the way Spain has suffered, given the amount of traffic in the Irish Sea. I welcome the Bill which I fully support. I congratulate the Minister and his Department.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_316">The Minister is very welcome. I also welcome this get-tough legislation and congratulate the Minister on his determination to improve the environment and give it a new look. It is a very challenging job.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I am delighted with many sections of the Bill which deal with the enhancement of the role of the EPA and the widening of the scope for licensing. I endorse all the comments of previous speakers in that regard. The Minister grasped the nettle with regard to waste charges when councils were unable to strike rates. While he had to do it, it is a pity because it looks as though we are diminishing the role of the councillor. I hope he will find a way of enhancing that role in future legislation. Unfortunately, because of the desire for local political advantage, some local authorities have not been able to fulfil their responsibilities. I regret this. It might not be an easy decision but responsibility should be faced. At the same time, however, I am conscious of the role of the councillor and hope the Minister will respect it. I know he will when dealing with other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">In relation to reducing waste and waste charges, we will have to go down the road of paying by weight. This must be the way forward. When people's pockets are hit – when they know they can reduce their payments by lowering the weight of their rubbish – they will make the effort to reduce it. It will put full responsibility back on the household. Householders want to throw the responsibility away and blame somebody else, calling the waste charges an extra tax. If they are made responsible, the amount of waste will be reduced. How do we educate the public about recycling? There is the potential for a huge programme. We have a great system in south Dublin – we went into the local schools and had parent meetings and evening meetings at which the separation of waste was demonstrated – and it is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The size of the bin should also be reassessed. Even one person households have a large bin which has to be struggled with through the hall door and out the back door and again in the other direction. We should consider introducing a small, adaptable bin. Many older people who live in big houses struggle to drag big bins outside. Will the Minister look at ways of varying the size of bins?</p>
          <p eId="para_320">I am delighted the legislation allows for severe penalties for people who do not pay their charges and empowers local authorities to refuse to collect their waste. It is disgraceful that people can throw rubbish out and leave it for others to clean up. This is a get-tough Bill, which the public will like, and it will reach into every household, which is what we want it to do. The plastic bag levy was a great idea and this is an extension of that concept. If we make resources available for litter wardens to implement decisions, enforce penalties and support legislation through implementation, the Minister will have done a superb job.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">In relation to section 38, the Minister stated that all flyers attached to cars are to be made illegal. Does that apply to adverts placed in a new car by a salesperson when one buys it?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_324">I welcome the Minister. It is always gratifying to see a Waterford man in a senior position. While we have sparred with one another on numerous occasions, and will no doubt do so again in the future, I wish him continued success.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">There is no doubt that there was a need to introduce legislation on waste management and environmental protection in order to bring our laws into line with EU directives. The Bill before us has many merits. I welcome the strengthening of the anti-litter laws and the increased penalties. I also welcome the clarification and strengthening of the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency, bringing the waste-licensing system fully in line with the integrated pollution prevention and control directive. The Bill also places greater emphasis on energy efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I have no objection to the obligation on local authorities to refuse to collect household waste from a person who has failed to pay the relevant charge. Failure to change the law in this area would have made a mockery of the system. One cannot have a system where one person pays while the person next door does not and is not penalised. Local authorities must be able to take action in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">I welcome the provisions on the protection of groundwater and the upgrading of water quality. Senator Kitt referred to the importance of the prevention of pollution in our rivers and I welcome the new conditions concerning emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The strengthening of the powers of the EPA will place a significant burden on it Will additional resources be put in place for the agency? There is no point increasing its powers if it does not have the resources necessary to implement them.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I welcome the ban on flyers. Is it an offence to paste posters to poles? This is a dreadful practice because posters are often left in place for a long time and, as Senator Brady stated, in many instances one does not know who is responsible. The practice should be banned completely.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">There are many provisions of merit in the Bill, but I do not support the section which makes the review and variation or replacement of waste management plans an executive rather than a reserve function. This is a negation of democracy and a further erosion of local democracy. This provision transfers responsibility for an area which affects every community to an un-elected person to whom the public will have little or no redress. This is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and it surely flies in the face of the concept of better local government, to which the Government, in its current and previous incarnations, has paid lip service.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">We are being presented with the usual catch-phrases and sound bites, which have little or no substance. One wonders whether the Better Local Government document was geared towards and benefited the providers and administrators of the services, rather than the people who are supposed to receive them. Have the services to ordinary people improved significantly as a result of the document to which I refer? I do not believe so. Transferring further powers from elected members to people who will say "Yes, Minister" in order to comply with his or her wishes will further erode the power of elected members and, more importantly, the people they represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">There is no doubt the Bill will further strengthen the Government's intention to proceed with a number of incinerators. This will be justified by referring to advanced technology and the examples of well-run facilities in other countries such as Denmark. The Minister may be correct in this regard. I have not seen such facilities at first hand, but I am sceptical that this is the solution to our waste management crisis. The Government is not fully committed to recycling minimisation and waste re-use because it has come out against the subsidisation of the recycling of domestic waste, as evidenced by the Minister's answer to Deputy John Bruton's parliamentary question in the Lower House.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I accept, in theory, that the polluter pays principle requires that householders in Waterford and elsewhere pay the full economic cost of the recycling of their waste. The practical reality is that this would probably require refuse charges to increase to almost €1,000 per house, which is politically and practically unrealistic. Perhaps this is the direction in which the Government intends to go. Some say this is the re-introduction of rates through the back door and it is hard to disagree with this theory.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The ongoing public subsidy for recycling should remain in place. Capital grants alone will not be enough. Recycling is loss-making on a year to year basis, but I note from reports from the United States that the cost of recycling is in excess of 33% cheaper than incineration. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind when he is advocating the use of incinerators, because householders will be obliged to foot the bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">Waterford City Council and Waterford County Council have been waiting for a reserve judgment from the High Court since last February in order to decide whether they can proceed with a landfill site. This is a ludicrous situation and surely a timescale should be imposed on reserve judgments, particularly on crucial environmental issues that will have repercussions for local authorities throughout the country. While acknowledging that this is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I ask that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government bring this issue to the attention of his colleague with a view to changing legislation in the area as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">An Taisce has come in for praise and I support it on many issues. However, a facility is planned in Dungarvan, County Waterford, which will rejuvenate the town and, while the local branch of An Taisce is firmly in favour of the development, we have had interference from the national parent body, which is objecting. In many instances there are pluses and minuses where An Taisce is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">There are many laudable aspects to the Bill which will give greater protection to the environment. However, I have grave reservations regarding other areas I have highlighted, which will have devastating financial and environmental effects on everyone. Will the Minister rethink these areas?</p>

          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_338">I, too, welcome the Minister. I fully agree with him that it is time for tough decisions and new regulations to be made in regard to pollution prevention, control of the licensing system and the new amendments to the 1997 Act. The Bill also includes measures to strengthen the existing licensing system in terms of implementation and enforcement, especially with regard to pollution prevention and the minimising of environmental problems at source.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The inclusion of emission levels in licences is to be welcomed. Applicants for licences will have to fit the official criteria defined in the Bill and the provision for withdrawing and suspending licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">In the light of the fact that responsibility for waste management plans is being passed to managerial level, I thank the members of local authorities who have played a leading role in implementing the plans in recent years. I refer to my own area of the mid-west where the waste management plan was adopted by all the councils. Management will be implementing only what the councillors passed in their own local authorities. It is very important to recognise that any amendments to be made to a plan will involve consultation between each county manager and the local authorities concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Let us consider circumstances in which local authority managers are operating as regulators as regards the issuing of licences. We have all seen numerous milk trucks going down the one road doing the one service. Will local authorities have power, when issuing licences, to determine what areas in which these operators can operate? Will they dictate the charges for the collection of refuse, as issued under the licences?</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The regional waste management plan will now focus on implementation of these crucial regional plans. It is important to put in place the infrastructure necessary to maximise waste prevention. Also, it is important that local authorities have the means and funding to implement the new laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">I welcome the amendments to the Litter Pollution Act 1997. The requirement for articles or advertisements exhibited in public places to include the name and address of persons on whose behalf they are exhibited is very important, as are the local authority by-laws regarding distribution of advertising material. The provision stating promoters of events have to take necessary steps regarding litter pollution is very important. Will the Minister comment on the obligations on businesses regarding public areas outside their premises?</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I thank schools for the role they have played. Schoolchildren have the future of our environment at heart and, please God, will also have a leading role to play. I also thank the tidy towns committees for the role they have played and which they will continue to play. I wish the Minister every success in the implementation of the plans. They have been on the drawing board at local authority level for the past two years and it is now time for action.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_345">I welcome the Minister and the Bill. However, it is very unfortunate that we have to bring forward a Bill amending, to a great extent, one we passed so recently. This is not the fault of the Minister but we must try to make sure the Bills we pass do not require amendment within a few years, which is what has happened in respect of the 1996 Bill. I was present when it passed through the House. From the point of view of the public it is unfortunate that we have to change legislation so rapidly. All the changes do not have to be made because of an EU directive because the EU directive was issued in 1992. It took us a long time to do anything about that directive and, in the meantime, it was very hard for the public to know where it stood. It left the private sector wondering what kinds of pollution controls applied to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">As many Senators have said, the Bill takes away substantial power from locally represented politicians in terms of having control over waste management. While I have never been a member of a county council, I have been a member of a health board. What the Minister has done is understandable because unfortunately it is frequently very difficult to make elected representatives bring forward any form of control, local legislation or policy which does not bring good news. If there is any bad news, they are most reluctant to deal with it. While the Bill may involve a diminution of local democracy, I see the reason the Minister believed he had to give the power to local managers. Where local democracy is concerned, this move is objectionable, in principle, but there have been so many problems in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Given that we are talking about a greater devolution of powers, it is extraordinary that the Bill takes back such serious powers from local representatives. As I said, they only want to deal with the good news. Unfortunately, they have only themselves to blame in this instance. It is worth pointing out that councillors in England, following the Nolan report, have to had to be educated in the areas of law with which they are dealing. It might be worthwhile if we considered doing this here to make councillors realise they have huge responsibilities as well as major powers at local level. Does the Minister believe there is a possibility of having some form of training for councillors in this area because much of the legislation with which they have to deal is very complicated, as is the Bill before us?</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Would it not be splendid if we could use plainer and more comprehensible language in legislation, particularly legislation that has to be dealt with by ordinary people at local level? Section 12 of the Bill substitutes a new Part in the place of Part IV of the Act of 1992, section 99A(3) of which new Part states, "Regulations under paragraph (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) of subsection (1) shall not be made otherwise than with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment”. I think it means that regulations made under section 99A(1) must be made with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. They mean the same sort of thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">How can an ordinary person read section 19(2)(<i>b</i>)? It reads as follows: “.in subsection (10), by substituting the following paragraph for paragraphs (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) (inserted by the Act of 2001.”. It becomes extraordinarily complicated. Officials will be delighted to hear that the Bill is being read very thoroughly by someone.</p>

          <p eId="para_351">Schedule 1 refers to activities to which Part IV applies. If two or more activities falling within the same paragraph under a particular heading of this Schedule are carried on in the same installation by the same person, for the purpose of any threshold specified in the paragraph, the capacities of these activities shall be aggregated.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I am interested in matters relating to food and drink. Paragraph 7.3 refers to commercial brewing, distilling or malting installations, where production capacity exceeds 100,000 tonnes per year, not included in paragraph 7.8. Paragraph 7.8(<i>b</i>) refers to vegetable raw materials with a finished product production capacity greater than 300 tonnes per day – averaged on a quarterly basis. Brewing is based on barley, a vegetable raw material. If the capacities of activities are to be aggregated, are we to aggregate the 100,000 tonnes per year with the 300 tonnes per day multiplied by the number of days per year on which production takes place? This is very complicated for someone who wishes to stay within the law. I presume the provision is in place because the Government does not wish the legislation to apply to those involved in home brewing but I might be wrong. I found the Bill quite difficult to follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Senator Kitt referred to the report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland which was published recently. It is a very fine report. While public water supply is pretty good, there are some very worrying issues with certain group water supplies which should be looked at. The Bill contains an excellent section on groundwater but it would be good to include the report's recommendations on the quality of drinking water. If we do not, we will have to bring forward another Bill to take account of them. Some of the issues involved are urgent, one of which is the problem of cryptosporidium in the water supply. We do not have legislation which demands a search for cryptosporidium, a very unpleasant parasite usually originating in calves with scour. It can get into groundwater through the spreading of slurry from where it can get into the drinking water supply which makes this a serious problem. The last time I raised the matter I said there had been a problem in the Westmeath County Council local authority area. The council wrote to me to ask what I meant by this, which I thought was great. It recognised that there was a problem and discovered what its source in Mullingar was. There was no onus on it to look for cryptosporidium but it did and was able to get rid of it pretty briskly.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">Cryptosporidium is a dangerous water pollutant because it can cause very serious diarrhoea. An outbreak in eastern Canada several years ago resulted in the deaths of seven people. We do not know how many outbreaks we have had in which the cause of diarrhoea in an area was cryptosporidium because we do not enforce regulations which direct the authorities to look for the parasite. We know there has been an outbreak in Northern Ireland, which means that far from thinking Westmeath County Council was not doing a good job, we should recognise that it was. I am quite sure that is because it has the only female chief executive officer in the country. She looked at the hygiene of the area's water supply very closely.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">It would be a good idea to implement the report's recommendations now rather than wait for yet another Bill. Some of the problems we face are extraordinarily serious. The Bill is a fine example of good and technical legislation but it is not very clear in many places to people like me who attempt to read it. I look forward to hearing about brewing and hope I am right to think that the legislation is phrased as it is to avoid a scenario in which we chase home brewers around the countryside under the regulations. It is not clear to me from the Bill whether the EPA now has the power to bring people to court through its notices on licences or if it must still obtain notices under various pollution Acts. There is much in the Bill which I look forward to addressing on Committee Stage. In fact, I feel a few amendments coming on.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Mr. Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_356">I welcome this legislation which addresses long-overdue issues. For too many years we have taken the environment for granted and looked at the world around us as an unlimited resource capable of absorbing whatever battering we gave it. We know now that this is not the case and that too much damage has already been done, though thankfully not so much as to be irreversible. We are much more aware of the need to care for the environment and that it is sometimes the simple things we do which will have a long lasting effect on the quality of our way of life. Measures we take can range from protecting the air we breathe through the non-production of smoke and toxins to keeping our streets clean by ensuring our dogs do not spoil them. Such simple and common-sense measures would have been laughed at a decade or two ago but we have all grown to understand much more about our environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">More controls have been introduced and, as a result of a programme of public education, much more is expected of everyone today. I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the Bill at this stage, though there are certain sections about which I am not entirely happy. Section 19 deals with waste management plans, sufficient progress on which has been delayed for far too long. The matter is fraught with difficulty but in order to progress the Minister has decided to make the plans a management function, bypassing elected council members. While I understand his reasoning and agree that experience to date points to this action being the only way to make progress, I cannot but feel that it contravenes a sacred principle and represents a significant erosion of democratic practice. I understand the Minister's intent and the frustration from he and his predecessor have suffered which is the reason, with some reluctance, I support the measure. It is quite obvious that in many areas a variety of pressures have made councillors reluctant to make the hard decisions called for by a faltering environment. Accordingly, if power to decide must be taken from them and given to someone who will make the hard choices, so be it.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I do not agree, however, with the divesting of the power to decide waste management charges. The city or county manager will decide what the charges will be and authority members will have no power of veto. That is a total erosion of democracy as such decisions have traditionally been the exclusive preserve of elected members and we do not find ourselves in circumstances which warrant the change. I urge the Minister to review this element of the measure. This is not to suggest that city or county managers are reckless or lacking in understanding. My experience of them has been otherwise. However, we cannot see the future or what the next crop of managers will be like. The principle involved is one with which I do not agree. This is the first time there has been a departure from the traditional method of setting charges and rates. It is a dangerous precedent and an unnecessary departure. Will there be any need for Estimates meetings in the future if the manager is to do it all? Is this the first of a series of such decisions? Local authority members are answerable to the public and should be the ones who decide. While I do not wish to labour the point, I ask the Minister to review the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">If councils, as landfill operators, must recover the full cost of their operations, the cost of waste management to the consumer will be horrendous. The Minister recently referred to a cost of €11 per collection but this may be a conservative estimate. With newer and higher standards for landfill sites being implemented on a continuing basis, costs will escalate and charges to the consumer will rise accordingly. Cross-subsidisation occurs in many areas of the public services. For example, the excise duty on petrol, car registration fees and motor taxation are not the only moneys spent on roads. There was a time when the road fund supplemented the Exchequer, much to the annoyance of regular road users.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">In this context we should be realistic about waste management, or bin charges, to use the better known term. We cannot ask people to pay the economic cost no more than they are expected to pay the economic cost for an overnight stay in hospital or a copy of the Flood tribunal interim report. I agree with the Minister's stance on those who do not wish to pay anything for the service. Neighbour should not subsidise neighbour, which principle should be copper-fastened in legislation. I am pleased the Minister is doing something about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The Bill provides that the EPA will have the power to revoke or suspend waste licences. Will this apply to emissions or smells? It needs to be spelled out who is responsible and in what jurisdiction. For example, in Waterford city a noxious smell can originate from a different local authority area and jurisdiction across the River Suir. The legislation may not deal with this aspect but it must be clarified.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Chapter 3 deals with the pollution of groundwater supplies in the context of the European Union directive on integrated pollution, prevention and control. The leakage of farm effluent into groundwater sources can be a major cause of pollution. Is this covered under the legislation? Will every farmer have to be licensed and monitored? If so, it will open a new vista and create immense new work. Clarification is required on this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Section 21 appears to deal with the practice of burning rubbish, which until recently was widespread. The Bill refers to an act being deemed likely to cause pollution until the contrary is shown. This appears to suggest that a person will have to prove that he or she did not do something, which would be a departure from what would be regarded as the norm, namely, the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Section 38 deals with litter pollution, something that has plagued the country for generations and a practice which is becoming less acceptable. While the situation has noticeably improved, there is still a long way go before the country is litter free. Unfortunately, those at school, our best educated generation, have little thought for litter. Whether it be fast food cartons, crisp bags, sweet wrappers or chewing gum, they scatter it freely and without thought for the consequences. Despite a concerted campaign, this activity still appears to be the norm.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Dog control and the toilet habits of pets in public are also a cause of concern. I ask the Minister to clarify the position arising from a recent case where a dog soiled a footpath but, being 20 or 30 yards from the owner, was not effectively under his control. Is this practice open to prosecution? A dog or litter warden should be able to prosecute on the basis of the owner's name on the dog's collar but other opinion takes the view that this would not be possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I am pleased the Minister has decided to prohibit the dubious and problematic practice of placing leaflets on cars. This is long overdue because it inevitably means that huge numbers of leaflets are left on the ground. I thought this matter had been previously dealt with but I am pleased it will no longer be lawful.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I am also pleased that local authorities will be able to make by-laws and exercise discretion on the question of poster advertising. Circuses have made a plea for latitude for their business and it would be regrettable if their existence was further jeopardised by removing their main source of advertising. I hope the local authorities will apply this measure in a humane, flexible and understanding way.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Auctioneers' signs can be a major blight on a streetscape, especially in cities, where a large number of properties in a street can change hands at the one time. They appear to be erected with impunity, yet they are more ugly than circus or other entertainment posters and can be <i>in situ</i> for much longer. Perhaps the Minister will clarify if this aspect is covered by the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">There are many fine aspects to the Bill and a few that require further attention. However, overall it covers much positive ground and I commend it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_370">Waste and other service charges are an unfair form of taxation. They are not income related and waivers do not address this aspect. Often, those on low incomes must pay. For example, in South Dublin County Council, of which I am a member, people are entitled to waivers if their sole income is from social welfare or if they are entitled to family income supplement. This means that those on small occupational pensions or who have a supplementary income to their social welfare income are excluded from the waiver provisions. This form of taxation is unfair to those on lower and middle incomes, particularly those in the PAYE sector. By contrast, service charges are small change for top income earners who manage to pay very little tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">These charges are a combination of new charges and increases in present charges. They have nothing to do with the environment and are being introduced because of the income tax cuts introduced by the Government, which have most benefited the better off. As a form of non-income related taxation, they are unfair, yet they are to become the means by which local government must make up the shortfall in Government investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The proposal to make charges an executive function is undemocratic. It removes any semblance of local democracy. The practice of councillors in this area has been subject to much myth making. They are making decisions and imposing charges. Differences of opinion or dissent does not mean there is a problem, rather it indicates that democracy is at work. The Government wishes to remove dissent on this issue, which is a bad move.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">These taxes have nothing to do with the polluter pays principle, about which many more myths have arisen. For example, the many people in my county who take the trouble to bring their empty bottles to collection centres and separate their cardboard and aluminium waste from other waste are not polluters. They are good citizens and we should not penalise them for what we want them to do, that is, recycle and segregate their waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Genuine green taxes would impose penalties on those who do not engage in environmentally sound practices. The plastic bag levy is an example as it means that people can use alternatives without having to pay the levy. These are the types of charges that should be considered. Fines should be imposed on those who, given the opportunity, refuse to recycle or overuse water.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The Government and management of councils are considering introducing pay by weight charges but it will be a long time before this happens. At present, flat charges apply. When I was a member of the Forum for Europe, it was addressed by a representative of the European Commissioner on the Environment. The issue of environmental charges was raised and he said flat charges were the least environmentally sound.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The provision in the Bill which allows local authorities to refuse to collect waste from households which have not paid the charge contravenes the Supreme Court judgment of 2001 and is certain to be challenged. If a citizen fails to pay income tax his child is not prevented from going to school. The same logic can be applied to the payment of water and waste charges. It is one thing to pursue the collection of a debt but quite another to deny a family a basic service which is essential to health and safety simply because the head of the household has failed to pay a local authority charge, perhaps on principled grounds. I believe the courts will rule against this measure in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The Government is strangling local government. This is happening partly because of the Government's policy of reducing the income tax base. Through this lack of funding it is forcing unfair tax policies on local authorities while people are seeing a reduced level of local services. By reducing the powers of local authority members the Government is showing that it does not care about local government. With the abolition of the dual mandate the Government is casting local government adrift to irrelevance. At the same time it is getting rid of directly elected mayors and reducing the powers of councillors. The abolition of the dual mandate will mean that things will continue in this direction because the only true social democrats left in Fianna Fáil are those Oireachtas Members who are also county councillors. They, at least, are in touch with the issues on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The threat to abolish county councils which do not adopt an Estimate within the allotted time has been referred to. The Minister says this is the law but this law is profoundly unconstitutional. One of the few positive measures taken by this Government in relation to local government was the insertion of a provision referring to local government in the Constitution. This provision says there shall be directly elected local authorities. An unelected commissioner cannot be consistent with this constitutional provision. This constitutional amendment may be the saviour of local government in the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Senator Henry mentioned education for county councillors on the law. If we educate county councillors enough in the legal background to the Government's provisions they may be the ones to challenge the Government's actions.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_380">I broadly welcome the thrust of the Bill, although I do not agree with everything in it. A clean environment is of immense importance to our quality of life and standard of living and is economically beneficial. An unclean environment is often a sign of economic and social backwardness. We saw this in central and eastern Europe when the Iron Curtain fell. To the extent that this Bill means we are becoming more serious about environmental protection I entirely support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">We remember the days 50 years ago when cattle markets were held in the streets and one could only go into the main street of a town if one was wearing boots. More recently we have seen hedgerows strewn with litter, and animals, if not humans, suffering from mysterious ill-health caused by pollution, the source of which was difficult to locate. People were afraid to complain for fear that they might endanger employment in an industry even though it was a dirty industry. Today, we can afford higher environmental standards. Indeed, we cannot afford not to have them.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">I have little sympathy with the anti-service charge campaigns which are routinely conducted, mainly by parties and independent politicians of the left. I remind Senator Tuffy that service charges legislation was introduced by the leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Dick Spring, when he was Minister for the Environment in 1983. In the 1980s when taxation was very heavy there was a case to be made about double taxation. However, in the present situation when taxation levels have been vastly reduced, as the Labour Party is the first to say, there is no case whatsoever for complaining about double taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Senator Tuffy's criticism about service charges could be made against any form of indirect taxation which is not directly income related. Our entire taxation system cannot be based on income tax and, besides, there are exemptions to service charges. Such arguments are made by people who preach social solidarity but in this case solidarity breaks down and people are encouraged not to support the community. The same politicians criticise taxation levels as being too low. I do not understand their logic and I believe theirs is a very tired campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I applaud the courage of the Lord Mayor of Dublin in overriding his party on this issue. If the Labour Party is to undergo a revival it will have to move on from these very tired tactics.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">Nor do I accept the sentiment that there is too much democracy in this country. In many respects there is not enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">As a possible compromise solution I suggest the one used in Europe. The Commission has many executive powers for which it does not necessarily need the consent of a majority of the Council of Ministers. However, the Council of Ministers can unanimously overturn a decision by the Commission. There is something to be said for a local authority having the power, if voting unanimously, to overturn any decision of the manager. I ask the Minister to look at that proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">There is enormous scope for improvement in recycling. I fully accept the view that seeping landfill sites and toxic dumps here and there are no longer an acceptable way of dealing with waste. What I am going to say is informed by involvement in the debate taking place in south Tipperary about a very specific type of incinerator. I will not refer to the specifics of the case but I will make some general points.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">What I welcome most about the Bill is that it seems that it will provide more serious enforcement and that facilities responsible for emissions and unacceptable smells and which have bad day-to-day operations will, if necessary, be closed down. I do not believe that sensitive, environmental facilities should be entrusted to people who have a bad environmental track record and who are courting ongoing problems for which there does not appear to be redress. I would certainly like the EPA to adopt a tougher approach. This may be quite wrong, but I have heard a comment attributed to a member of the EPA to the effect that it has never closed anything down. I am not sure that is a very proud boast. If facilities are causing serious pollution, they should be closed down.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I have not adopted an absolutist anti-incinerator position. There are specific matters relating to the position in Tipperary. I can understand why councils visiting places such as Denmark or Vienna – at the very heart of which an incinerator is situated – can see that there is a technically more advanced form of dealing with waste than exists here.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to interesting reports in <i>The Independent</i> and <i>The Guardian</i> because there is a debate taking place on this subject across the water. An environmental directive will come into force in 2005 which will cut dioxin emissions from incinerators. I presume any incinerator built under regional auspices here will reach those high standards and fully conform to EU directives. The British Environment Minister, Michael Meacher is quoted in <i>The Guardian</i> on 17 January 2003 as saying that “Dioxins are very nasty, but these are incredibly low levels . Even so the government is anxious that the numbers are reduced as much as possible.” A number of incinerators will simply be closed because they do not meet the standards. The Minister and the Department of the Environment and Local Government should look seriously into this matter and have discussions with their British counterparts.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">It was also stated in <i>The Guardian</i>:</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Mr. Meacher said he believed that more modern solutions, such as rubbish digesters, which produced gas to make electricity and left the residue as compost, would replace incinerators as a way of getting rid of rubbish. This would avoid the risk of creating dioxins altogether.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">We need to be at the cutting edge of the debate on this issue. For example, a demonstration took place at University College Dublin of a process called alkaline hydrolysis which is used for the incineration of meat and bonemeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I would not like to see incinerators being put in place all across the country. I accept they will probably be built to very high standards and will help reduce dioxins. I accept the latter are caused by other things, such as traffic, bonfires, burning cars, etc, but if there is a more sophisticated option we should consider it. I can only refer to the press cutting in my possession, but it is clear that the British Environment Minister has something specific in mind. I encourage the Irish Government to become involved in discussions with the British Government to see if there are better methods of eliminating waste than the use of incinerators.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_402">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate, but I regret that the Minister is not present. He stated earlier: "In a democratic society legislation is the foundation for action in the interests of the common good." In the past, his Department produced documents entitled, Better Local Government and Changing our Ways. The public has responded to a great extent to requests for change in the way in which waste is disposed of, but I heard the Minister say earlier that it is a matter of getting tough and staying tough. Here we have a Minister using language that does nothing to encourage the population. He has made a clear statement that he is not in favour of turning, regardless of the protests and concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I welcome Senator Mansergh's identification of his serious concern – which is shared by many Members and the public at large – regarding incineration. The Minister is saying that, come hell or high water, we are going to have incineration because that is the best way forward. He is getting tough. That is the language he used. It is a pity that a Minister whose Department asked the public to change its ways has used such language.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Much of what the Minister said previously seems to dictate that this is the way it is going to be and that we must do as he says. Once again he has seriously encroached upon, and rapped the knuckles of, every public representative. However, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, fails to recognise that, in most instances, because of the make-up of many local authorities, it is his party's councillors who have rebelled and said "No" to his desires and those of the Department of the Environment with regard to waste management.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">There is a waste management plan for every county. When those plans were democratically voted on, they were, by and large, rejected. The Minister said that since councillors have failed to take action he will give the power to somebody else. This has happened before and it is regrettable that it is happening again. It is clear from the content of the Bill that the Minister is saying that he will empower somebody who will do the job his way. I recognise the aspirational content of the Bill, but, in that context, we must consider the record of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and local authorities which were responsible for the greatest amount of pollution in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Let us consider the River Shannon and its lakes and the sewerage system in towns such as Athlone, Portumna and Limerick. The discharge of untreated sewage into the lakes and rivers in the area to which I refer has been unbelievable. The sewerage facilities in these towns are inadequate to properly treat such sewage, which is then dumped into the Shannon and its lakes. Lough Derg is being attacked, on one hand, by local government, which has responsibility for maintaining the quality of water at a high standard, and, on the other, by another government agency, Bord na Móna, which controls the discharge of silt into the lake. Effectively, this fresh water lake has been destroyed. Until recently, Bord na Móna failed to put in place the proper mechanism to reduce – not eliminate – the discharge of silt into the Shannon and Lough Derg.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">In Kinvara in my constituency in County Galway, there is a discharge of raw sewage, despite requests in the past for funding to put in place a proper sewerage system in the most sensitive of areas where the oyster beds are situated. Scientists have found that the nature of the currents has magnified the discharge in that it constantly circulates within the bay and it has done, and has the potential to do, serious damage to the oyster beds which are renowned worldwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">On the one hand, there are aspirational contents in this Bill which we must bring into effect, while on the other hand there is the serious situation whereby the Department of the Environment and Local Government is turning a blind eye to what is going in practice in regard to pollution. The main contributors to the pollution of our waterways are local authorities and State agencies and many others besides.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">This is a retrograde step. We have been told local authorities have failed to bring in the necessary by-laws and charges and to identify sites for landfills. It is unacceptable that four landfill sites have been proposed for a small section of County Galway. These sites were identified by consultants engaged by the Department. Senator Norris accused all public representatives of having a NIMBY attitude in regard to landfills and incinerators. The sad reality is that he is not responsible to the electorate. A select privileged group elects him to the House and he is not responsible for the identification or provision of landfills or incinerators. It is easy for him to come into the House and to be glib in his remarks in that instance. It is worth noting that.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The Minister has decided to give the power to the executives to make those changes. In the case of County Galway, three proposed landfill sites have been identified. The difficulty in regard to a number of them has been highlighted and they are being put through a very tortuous process. The reality is that there are far more acceptable and suitable sites available in County Galway but the consultants have made up their minds and will not even consider them. Senator Kitt will verify that the consultants were invited to view sites which were ideally suited. The public representatives begged the management and the consultants to look at those sites but they would not do so as they had made up their minds. That is the very attitude emanating from the Minister when he says, "Get tough, stay tough." That is a very wrong attitude to any public utility, public policy or public representative at national level. It is that bed on which the Minister will have to lie and accept the responsibility.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">In the last two days, a transport carrier brought a consignment of goods from Northern Ireland to Cork. On the return journey to the North, the licensed carrier took on board a huge quantity of waste, some of which was identified as Government originated waste. On the journey to Northern Ireland, the truck overturned outside Athlone – hence we had a problem. Will the Minister ask the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate fully and report back to this House on whether the cargo was legitimate and whether the carrier was licensed to carry waste, including Government waste, from Cork to Northern Ireland for export, maybe to some landfill in Northern Ireland? Is that in accordance with our laws? Is it in order that that is going on? If there are legitimate licensed waste disposal agencies in the South of Ireland, why is some of that waste being carried – maybe illegally, although I will hold my judgment on that – to Northern Ireland for disposal in landfills in there or for transportation to Scotland?</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I see in the media today reference to the possible, or potential, danger of transporting waste. This is a practical example which happened in the past two days.

          <p eId="para_421">There is serious concern about the use of nitrates, particularly by the agriculture sector. The Minister expressed the wish that the country be treated as one unit in terms of measures which he hopes will be introduced in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food in regard to the use of nitrates. Most experienced professionals dealing with this matter agree that it is not necessary to treat the country as one unit and that it is necessary to differentiate between the west and the intensive agricultural areas of Leinster and the dairying areas of the south where there is extensive use of nitrates. There is no doubt the agriculture industry, which is already on its knees, must accept the reasonable imposition of rules and regulations to ensure a safer environment and quality of water.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">However, most of the recent reports on the quality of water indicate that where there are private group water schemes, the quality of water on average is far better than that in many outdated public water systems. Will the Minister differentiate the different areas of the country with regard to nitrate usage?</p>
          <p eId="para_424">This Bill which implements an EU directive is important. However, when I see the serious effects of some of the directives which have been transposed into Irish law, I hope the Minister is not implementing a directive which will cause as much difficulty as the Habitats Directive under which 25% of some counties is designated. This has had consequences for the way of life of many people. If we are now going to encroach upon a reasonable way of life, we are fast entering a cul-de-sac from which we will not be able to exit.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">We need high quality water supplies, yet the Department and its agencies have been the greatest offenders in destroying them. The River Shannon and Lough Derg are classic examples of this, as the Minister would see if he ever cared to visit them. I welcome Senator Mansergh's concern about incineration. We have to change our ways. It is time for the Minister to change his also instead of saying, "Get tough, stay tough."</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_426">Aontaím leis na Seanadóirí eile agus iad ag gabháil fáilte leis an Aire agus leis an mBille seo. I welcome certain provisions of the Bill which will help to tackle some of the environmental difficulties we are experiencing. Like other Members, however – even those on this side of the House – I have strong reservations about other provisions of the Bill about which I will speak presently. Integrated pollution prevention and control is a welcome initiative. The old adage that prevention is better than cure definitely applies in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The change from best available technology not entailing excessive costs, BATNEEC, to best available techniques, BAT, concerns me a little. Despite this, I note from the Minister's address that there are some mitigating provisions within the Bill in that economic aspects will have to be examined, even in the context of best available technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">My experience in industry has been that often when regulating authorities receive applications for various licences, particular those of a very technical nature, they do not always have the in-house expertise to deal with them. Consequently, they may go to outside consultants whose cost effectiveness criteria are not always what industry would want. In bringing about this change we must not cause costs to escalate for industry. Our competitiveness is one of the serious challenges facing the economy which many economic commentators have been debating. Any further erosion of our competitiveness in any sphere will be detrimental to our future economic well being. The Minister may well deal with those concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The Bill will give the Environmental Protection Agency power to regulate greenhouse gases in order to meet our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. As we are currently struggling to meet them, I applaud the Minister for his efforts in that regard. Our generation has benefited from the technological revolution but the environment has paid a price as a result of that process. When one considers that the earth has been in existence for billions of years, a human lifespan gives us but a short lease on the earth's wellbeing. It behoves us to ensure we can stand over our legacy and that it will not prove detrimental to future generations. I applaud any initiatives taken in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">When the Waste Management Bill was introduced, I had difficulties with it, even though I was spokesman on environmental matters for my party. I am strongly opposed, in principle, to the replacement of a waste management plan with an executive function. It must be conceded that in certain instances councils did not face their responsibilities in making such plans. While I am aware of the frustrations of the previous Minister who faced a particularly difficult challenge, I did not agree with the route followed in making the waste management plan a management function. I did not consider it to be the correct course of action because there were other ways of achieving the same outcome. I had a particular difficulty with the situation in the south-east, with which the Minister will be familiar. In Wexford we took a decision to adopt our own waste management plan which excluded incineration. It is the democratic right of local people to do so, as long as they deal responsibly with the waste issue. I concede, however, that this matter presents a major challenge nationally and locally. We excluded incineration on a 19-1 vote for a number of reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">All the regional waste management plans were undertaken by a small number of consultants who in some instances were working for people operating incinerators or applying for permission to do so. I have no doubt that some of them have been, or will be, consultants for some of the applicants who may come before us. There is a severe conflict of interest involved in that process which is flawed as a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I do not want to reopen the debate on incineration other than to say we will have made a major mistake if we end up with an incinerator in every region. A number of us were in Florida recently and visited a county where they are still operating landfill; their intention is to continue doing so. Unlike Ireland, they have made provision for landfill for the next 50 to 60 years and it may be of interest to the Minister that this method of disposal costs $33 per tonne. They say they make a small profit, even though they are only obliged to break even. The neighbouring county is using incineration and the corresponding cost of disposal is $80 per tonne. They made the point that the incineration process had an almost insatiable appetite for waste. Therefore, the environmental provisions – which the Minister is rightly going to pursue – of prevention, minimisation, recycling and reuse tend to get a lower priority. That is because if they fail to supply sufficient waste, the local authority must pay a penalty for the shortfall.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I am delighted the Minister has been appointed to this portfolio and I am familiar with his activities locally in the south-east. He has the capability, energy and drive to be an excellent Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I urge him to examine this matter thoroughly. There may well be an argument for incineration, particularly concerning hazardous waste. However, if every tonne of domestic waste went for incineration, it would drive costs through the roof.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_437">We visited a landfill site also and saw the operation there. While it would not be up to the standards of the Kill site, it would be up to the standard of others. They had taken off the leechate and were also burning the gases.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">By making waste management an executive function, however, we are removing what should be the primary responsibility of the elected representatives. I would much prefer a system which placed a mandatory responsibility on local authorities to make reasonable, practical and cost-effective arrangements for all their activities, including waste management. Just as with striking a rate and providing finances, if they fail to do so there should be a penalty. That underwrites the mandatory approach to it. I would prefer that to the approach of giving it to management who often, no more than councillors, do not have the technical expertise to properly assess the issues and make decisions. They depend on consultants as much as we do. In the current climate of tribunals, investing such powers in one individual rather than in a group of people where it is transparent and open to public debate is a weakness. That aspect might be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">If I am opposed to powers in that regard being an executive function, obviously I am strongly opposed to the charges being applied by managers. I have been involved for a long time in local government and have seen the continual erosion of powers. In part, we as councillors have been the architects of that. We often shy away from difficult decisions, whether it is traveller accommodation or whatever, and hide behind the manager.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">A report on competitiveness published in 1995 found that of all the countries surveyed Ireland had the most centralised system. That was remarkable, considering there were countries such as China and communist states emerging from the eastern bloc. We must find a mechanism where we will be forced, as councillors, to make decisions. I have no time for the populist politics in which all parties have participated. Fianna Fáil removed rates in 1977. It had nothing to do with local government but was in order to win the election. Fine Gael outbid it in the removal of agricultural rates. Between them agricultural rates were removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I agree with Senator Mansergh. When Dick Spring introduced water charges, I attended meetings where people complained about the cost. I remember pointing out that the cost per week was less than one glass of beer or a television licence and a fraction of an electricity bill. I asked if they had to do without either electricity or water which they would choose. It would be a difficult decision. It is as ludicrous to argue that electricity should be free as it is to argue that water or the collection of waste should be free. It does not stand up. While I oppose what the Minister is doing I understand the reason and have some sympathy with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I listened to the leader of the Labour Party who said the party had taken a decision to instruct its councillors on Dublin City Council to vote against the charges being proposed.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">I read the Minister's comments with regard to the cost per tonne. In our county, we use surplus funding from the charges towards other services. I note that while the charges will be an executive function there is provision in the Bill requiring a landfill operator to levy such landfill charges "as to ensure recovery of the full cost of the facility concerned". I do not disagree with that, but if it is included in the Bill why should it be necessary for the manager to be given the right to make the charge? If that is a reserved function, am I right in saying there is a statutory obligation on councillors to ensure they comply with it, which means that the charge levied must recover the cost of the service and the landfill operation?</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_449">That is because we are behind in the environment provision of regulating landfills and so on. The Minister should look at this before Committee Stage. If local government is continually eroded, how can we expect people of ability to go forward for election and make a contribution?</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The removal of the dual mandate and the proposed removal of the directly elected chair will leave local government, to some extent, leaderless. We should strive to make local government fulfilling and of interest to those who give of their time, seven days a week, year in, year out. There are several examples of people who do that in every county. If we remove many of the powers and functions from local government, who will be interested in participating? The challenge is to have a process that meets the obligations the Minister seeks to set out which not only preserves but strengthens local government and gives us local authorities on a par with continental Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Much of what I have said on those issues has been negative but I would welcome the obligation on all to pay the charges. The Minister is right in saying that if people do not pay they should not get the service. That principle applies in business. A local authority is a big business and it should apply equally here. The time has come to stop people free loading on others.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Any initiative taken on litter fines is welcome. There are community wardens. We have a pilot scheme in our county and they do excellent work. However, as regards litter they are ineffective because they do not have the legal or moral authority to get people's names and addresses. That is a practical difficulty that should be examined. Any efforts made in this area would be productive.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_459">I thank the Leader of the House for her warm welcome. It is always a pleasure to come to the Seanad because it is where I cut my political teeth in 1977. The Seanad meets more often now than it did when it was very much a part-time exercise and one could come here for an hour or two a week. The new Leader in particular has insisted on longer hours and more effective work, which I welcome. I welcome also the fact that the Seanad has facilitated this early Second Stage debate on the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">This Bill provides for the establishment on a statutory basis of a body to be known as Science Foundation Ireland (SFI). The new body will be an agency of Forfás. The establishment of this new agency is central to an overall strategy which would see Ireland as a leader in the global knowledge-based economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Ireland's emergence as Europe's high-growth economy has been a feature of the last decade. This transformation has arisen as a result of many factors, including a dynamic and youthful population, the pursuit of pragmatic and innovative Government policies, openness to trade, not only in goods and services, but also in new ideas, and an emphasis on education and technological innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">There are many new threats which we now face. The less favourable external environment will test our competitiveness. Other pressures are arising from changes to the ways in which industry operates. We have seen a strong trend towards the movement of manufacturing towards lower cost economies. This reflects the fact that Ireland is no longer a low wage economy and must make that transition to higher added value products and services that allow us to sustain and grow incomes. A key part of this process is to recognise the importance of knowledge creation and innovation in sustaining and enhancing competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Ireland's sustained economic growth and prosperity will depend on establishing a culture of scientific and technological innovation, a high level of research and development and a globally competitive knowledge-based economy. Such re-positioning is essential to provide sustainable, high-quality, well-paid jobs in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The past decade might be described as revolutionary in growing and transforming our economy, in making it competitive and in providing employment. The next decade must be equally revolutionary. We must take the next step and move from the rhetoric to the reality of building a knowledge-based economy because this is where our future lies. Science, technology, research and innovation are the key words of the future. We must build the structures which support research excellence. We must enhance our ability to compete at the pinnacle of knowledge and produce the people through our educational system who will take on the new challenges. A cornerstone of this future is building our research capability in our universities, institutes and enterprises – in essence, the research infrastructure which will make it possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The process leading to the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland started in 1998 when a major Technology Foresight Initiative was carried out by the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation. Foresight is about preparing for the future. It is about deploying our resources the best way possible, for competitive advantage, enhanced quality of life and for sustainable development. It is about identifying the opportunities and challenges in the future, and what Government, scientists and engineers should be doing to meet them. The Technology Foresight Initiative sought to identify emerging technologies that will be the key to national economic development in future years and to present a plan of action to address the opportunities and challenges associated with these technologies. In carrying out this analysis, ICSTI consulted widely with scientists, industrialists, Government officials and others to achieve a high degree of consensus on the public policy actions Ireland needs to take in order to invest in the research and technologies required to underpin future economic growth and living standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The Technology Foresight Report contained a specific recommendation that a fund should be established to invest in research in those key areas of technology that can best assist in upgrading the future competitiveness of the traded goods and services sector. The report recognised that in order to achieve this outcome, a qualitative shift of industrial policy would be required. This would also have to be accompanied by a significant increase in the level of resources allocated to investment in research which would achieve the excellence and critical mass needed to give our country an international reputation in specified technological sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">In February 2000, the Government approved the establishment of the Technology Foresight Fund, from which €646 million is being used to support research excellence in strategic technologies, particularly the development of world-class capabilities in the niche areas of information and communication technologies and biotechnology. The Government also approved the establishment of a national strategic research foundation, Science Foundation Ireland, as a mechanism for the management, allocation, disbursal and evaluation of this expenditure from the fund. To allow the foundation to commence operations almost immediately, the Government agreed that it could be established under the existing Industrial Development Acts as a sub-board of Forfás. The purpose of the Bill is to establish the foundation as a separate legal entity.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Science Foundation Ireland will invest in funding research that is of intrinsic excellence and acknowledged internationally, is of a sufficient scale and critical mass to have real significance in Ireland and internationally, and strengthens the scientific foundations on which to develop high-productivity, high-technology, market-driven, knowledge-intensive investments, including start-ups, in Ireland's industrial and services sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">In line with the technology foresight report, the foundation will concentrate on the fields underpinning the industrial sectors of biotechnology and information and communications technology with a view to promoting and supporting basic research of world class stature in these fields. A world class research capability in selected segments of these two enabling technologies will become an essential foundation for future growth in our economy. Information and communications technology involves all disciplines that underpin the study of physical components, systems, networks, storage, transmission, software, and applications as well as the underlying fields of mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, materials science, and electrical engineering. Information and communications technology is at the core of the knowledge society, as scientific and engineering research today requires the use of systems and processes that information and communications technology research has produced.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">For example, microelectronic devices, based on conventional silicon technology, continue to decrease in size each year, resulting in the production of ever more powerful computers and processors. Within the next two decades this technology will approach theoretical limits as the device dimensions approach the atomic scale. New breakthrough technologies such as molecular electronics based on new materials and fabrication techniques with new device concepts will be required to continue the progress in electronics technology experienced in the 50 years since the invention of the transistor. These advances will be of profound significance to the microelectronics and semiconductor industries, industries which have had a profound impact on our economic fortunes in recent times. Without the efforts of an institution such as Science Foundation Ireland, this country and its economy may well fall behind in the global race for advancement.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Agencies such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have helped to give Ireland a global reputation as a major competitor for ICT industrial investment. By building a globally renowned research base focusing on the fields that underpin ICT, the economy can build on the relationship it has already formed with this industry. We can play a competitive role in defining and shaping economic activity and technological advancements worldwide. This represents an enormous opportunity but also a threat, as if we miss it, we will face the possibility of being left behind as the 21st century progresses. Ireland's research institutions are involved in most of the key research areas in ICT, including some engaged in globally distinguished research. Ireland must focus on developing ICT research programmes in areas that can compete on a global scale. This will require the formation of outstanding research centres, as well as the recruitment and development of critical masses of research talent.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Biotechnology includes areas such as gene expression, protein synthesis and characterisation, DNA chips, genomics, biosensors, drug delivery and bioremediation. This research will affect health care, pharmaceuticals, environmental management, agriculture, marine science, medical devices, consumer products and food and drink businesses. The technology foresight report notes that by 2005 the worldwide market for biotechnology industries is expected to rise to €250 billion and will support 3 million jobs in Europe. Beyond such specific financial expectations lies the widely accepted view that research and technologies in these areas will be key drivers of global and national economies. Research in biotechnology promises to play as pivotal a role in social and industrial development over the next few decades as physics and chemistry did following the Second World War.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The extensive sectors already influenced by research in biotechnology suggest the importance that strength in such areas could have for Ireland. Similar industries have played a significant part in the economic growth of the past 20 years. Ireland is home to the operational bases of nine of the world's ten largest pharmaceutical companies, linking it closely to an industrial culture among the leaders of the knowledge revolution. Combined with the recent emergence of indigenous biotechnology start-up companies, such relationships give Ireland a crucial opportunity to prove itself a successful innovator and knowledge generator. An example of the possibilities of world class research in one area within the biotechnology area is the new techniques for studying incredibly small-scale phenomena being developed at present. Efforts in this area will provide detailed understanding of the structure and behaviour of biological systems such as cell membranes. Innovative research could provide new insights into how cells respond to their structural and chemical environments and may lead, for instance, to the development of new drug delivery systems that could advance the treatment of numerous diseases. The advances that will be made will be of profound significance to the biotechnology industry which is already heavily involved in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Progress in genomics, bioinformatics and structural biology will create major research and economic opportunities over the next 20 years. Such developments support the assertion in the technology foresight report that strategic research advantages in biotechnology will bring the State highly important long-term benefits. In the initial period from its creation to 2007, the SFI will concentrate on the research segments which have the greatest likelihood of producing significant results for Irish research and development. The potential for biotechnology related researchers in Ireland is particularly exciting given the chance they have to ally themselves uniquely with leading corporate research centres which have been the basis for strong manufacturing developments in the country. Such prospects and the likely global value of discoveries in these fields suggest how important research in fields underpinning biotechnology could be to Ireland's future. The SFI will review its focus in biotechnology and ICT regularly to seek the most promising opportunities. The SFI offers, through investments in these areas, the possibility of significantly enhancing Irish science, engineering and economic growth and becoming a vital partner in building a research system recognised and distinguished around the world for its excellence.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">As I said, sustained economic growth and prosperity depends on establishing a culture of scientific and technological innovation, a high level of research and development and a globally competitive knowledge-based economy. Such repositioning is essential to provide sustainable, high quality, well paid jobs in the future. The greatest challenge facing Ireland's research and development goals is building its most important resource: the human talent that drives discovery, innovation and prosperity. Meeting this challenge will require Ireland to make science and engineering careers attractive to students. We must provide incentives to encourage graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and non-tenured researchers to stay active in research and engineering in Ireland and recruit and retain outstanding researchers from abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">In its specific role within the research and development system in the target areas, the SFI will improve the development of human capital by generating and supporting initiatives focused on individuals with the capacity to significantly advance Ireland's research excellence and using international peer merit review to assess research proposals and the track record of applicants. This review process provides a recognised measure of excellence and valuable feedback for the research community. The SFI will work with Irish universities and institutes of technology to seek out and bring to Ireland researchers and research teams in science and engineering who are acknowledged as world leaders in their fields. It will also work with its fellow Irish research funding agencies to invest in national and regional facilities, laboratories and equipment that ensure productive and globally competitive research environments. Such capital infrastructure will not only advance Ireland's science and engineering capacities it will also help to develop, retain and attract highly skilled researchers.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Ireland is a relatively small country with a small population which has used its best talents to achieve huge amounts in the past ten years. It has used its size to provide agility, flexibility and adaptability, qualities much valued in this post-industrial age. Ireland can compete globally when its Government Departments, agencies, universities, institutes of technology and researchers work together to support new collaborative opportunities focused on carefully chosen areas of research. The SFI will involve the academic community as it builds the new SFI awards and grants structure announced early in 2002. It will work with IDA Ireland to attract research and development from multinational companies based overseas and support Enterprise Ireland in encouraging start-up research and development oriented companies. The SFI will pursue all opportunities to work closely with the Higher Education Authority on biotechnology and ICT research investments. Such shared activities can be of great value to Ireland's research based competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Since its establishment as a sub-board of Forfás in 2000, the SFI has shown itself to be an energetic organisation, filled with ambition and enthusiasm. It has introduced a range of policies and established five key programmes: SFI fellow awards, investigator programme grants, centres for science, engineering and technology grants, ETS Walton visitor awards and SFI workshop and conference grants. It has recruited and retained the expertise of approximately 80 research scientists and engineers and their teams for a total investment commitment of €152 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Science Foundation Ireland offers the prospect of acting as a catalyst for Ireland's future economic and social transformation into a knowledge-based economy in the same way that Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland helped to support the development of the economy to its current level. Establishing the foundation on a statutory basis is essential if we are to sustain this transformation, a transformation that, if attained and exploited, will yield untold benefits for future generations of Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">As I indicated, the main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland as an agency of Forfás. The Bill also provides for amendments to the Industrial Development Acts 1986 to 1998 and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company (Amendment) Act 1986. These amendments arise from the establishment of the foundation as an agency of Forfás and also the necessity to update certain financial limits. Part 1 of the Bill contains standard provisions relating to the short title, collective citation, interpretations, establishment day, expenses and procedure for making regulations. Part 2 deals with the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland. Section 6 provides for the establishment of the foundation as a corporate body and an agency of Forfás. In that regard, the foundation will come within the policy and co-ordination remit of Forfás and its powers have been extended to allow for this in section 34.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Section 7 sets out the functions of the foundation. The foundation will promote, develop and assist the carrying out of oriented basic research in strategic areas of scientific endeavour that concern the future development and competitiveness of industry and enterprise in Ireland. These strategic areas include information and communication technologies and biotechnology.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Sections 8 to 12 provide for the board, its composition, chairperson and meeting arrangements. Sections 13 and 14 cover the appointment of the director general and include a provision requiring him or her to be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees. Sections 15 to 18 contain standard provisions on disclosure of interests, disclosure of information, and provision of a seal. Sections 19 to 21 contain staffing provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Under the terms of the Industrial Development Act 1993, as amended by the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998, Forfás is the overall employer of both its own staff and staff of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA. It is proposed to retain this approach for Science Foundation Ireland: staff will be employed by Forfás and seconded to Science Foundation Ireland. However, provision is also being made to allow the foundation to assume the role of employer should this prove necessary at some future date.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Section 22 allows the foundation to engage consultants and advisers while section 23 obliges it to prepare strategy statements and work programmes. Section 24 provides for an annual report and also requires that accounts are submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit. Section 25 provides that the foundation shall provide the Minister and Forfás with any information they may require while section 26 provides that it may build, purchase or lease land or buildings required for its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Part 3 of the Bill amends the Industrial Development Acts 1986 to 1998 and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company (Amendment) Act 1986. Provision is made in sections 33, 34(<i>e</i>) and 35 for the raising of existing legislative thresholds of the aggregate amounts of grants to Forfás and its agencies – Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and, on the enactment of this Bill, Science Foundation Ireland – Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards for use in discharging their obligations and liabilities. The increase is necessary because the bodies in question are now nearing the existing statutory limit in respect of the total amount of moneys which may be granted to the bodies for the exercise of their functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Provision is made for the raising of threshold levels in the 1986 Act – most recently set in section 34 of the 1998 Act – in respect of various industrial incentive instruments, above which Government approval is required for the agency concerned to proceed with payments to individual industrial projects. The existing thresholds were set in 1998 and, taking inflation into account, this has resulted in a significant increase in the number of projects which require Government approval. The threshold for capital grants is raised in section 34(<i>f</i>), that for employment grants is raised in section 28, that for equity provision is raised in section 31, the aggregate threshold for all investment aid is revised and raised in section 32, the threshold for training grants is raised in section 29 and the threshold for research and development grants is raised in section 30. The existing provisions on employment grants and research and development grants are redrafted to take account of current practice in using these instruments – employment grants are dealt with in sections 27 and 28, and research and development grants in section 30.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The establishment of Science Foundation Ireland is highly significant, both for the advancement of science in Ireland and ensuring Ireland develops a reputation for excellence in basic research which is among the highest in the world. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"/>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_200">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_489">I welcome the Tánaiste and the Bill. The Tánaiste has outlined the background to the establishment of the SFI from its small beginnings as a sub-division of Forfás in 2000. Establishing Science Foundation Ireland on a statutory basis is a radical but very welcome departure as the country seeks to build a global knowledge-based economy. It is obvious, as the Tánaiste has pointed out, that the reason for the establishment of the SFI is that if Ireland is to maintain its recent economic success, it must continue to raise the level of excellence and quality of the industries located here. This is because Ireland can no longer compete on a cost basis with other, cheaper economies around the world. We can only compete on skills and quality. The SFI will contribute to improving standards in both areas by attracting first-class researchers to live and work in Ireland. These researchers will also support the development of a thriving ecosystem of world-class research in Ireland that will lead to new discoveries and innovations and also be attractive to industries which need these scarce skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">In using the budget allocated to the SFI to attract a critical mass of excellent researchers to research laboratories and third level education institutions in Ireland, the SFI offers Ireland the prospect of competing and winning in the global race for knowledge in both biotechnology and information and communications technology. In recruiting these leading researchers the SFI also aids efforts to continuously raise skill levels and competencies in Ireland. This is a critical requirement if we are to have the personnel and skills required to meet the demands of the next phase of our country's development. The establishment of the SFI complements similar departures in successively legislating for the establishment of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, organisations which have played a major role in recent times in the development of the economy and, in turn, our society. SFI activities will be complementary to the work of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in their efforts to move Irish companies up the value chain.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The funding allocated to the SFI is a vital component of the €2.54 billion investment in research, technological development and innovation in the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The overall allocation to Science Foundation Ireland is €635 million. Most knowledge-based economies and societies, such as Finland, which has a history and population similar to our own, are built around world-class research institutions, skills and abilities. Correctly exploited and utilised, innovation and world-class research can be harnessed to the benefit of future generations in Ireland. Accordingly, the establishment of the SFI and the funding allocated to it are an investment in the future growth of the economy. If we do not follow through on these investment requirements, we may well fall behind in our efforts to establish Ireland as a leading player in the global knowledge-based economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I am very impressed with the progress made so far by the SFI, which is still in its infancy, and understand it will make financial investments amounting to around €200 million by the end of March this year. One has to be impressed by Dr. William Harris, director general of Science Foundation Ireland, whose speech to the Irish Management Institute's national management conference in Killarney, entitled "The New Business Environment – Navigating In Uncharted Waters", I read with interest. He realises that we are in a race to take a prominent position on the scientific map of the world. With a budget of €635 million to make this happen and a compass in his hand, he is working out the co-ordinates and has been doing so for some time. He believes that Ireland's sustained economic growth and prosperity will depend on establishing a knowledge-based economy, a high level of research and development and a culture of scientific and technological innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">It is obvious that Dr. Harris realises our position and the competition with which we must deal. If we fail to attain the next level, our ability to compete will be greatly diminished. It is obvious that Dr. Harris has thought a great deal about economic and social change and takes the view that things evolve and change over time and few of them remain static for long. He believes that "a country's greatest asset is its people and its educational system".</p>
          <p eId="para_494">In the past, people worried about coal, steam and big factories and never thought about people being more than machines. Ireland is a well-educated nation and an economy which recognises that it is stuck between the US and Europe, an ideal position from which to compete. It has positioned itself through good relationships between the Government and the industrial sectors and has identified successful revenue and riches that will ultimately benefit the social structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Dr. Harris has rightly asserted that this century will be driven by the ability to have well-educated people who can use information and knowledge. This is tempered by his own experiences with the National Science Foundation in the US. He believes that the creation of an engine room or power source pumping out new talent and identifying new scientific, technological and industrial fields is absolutely critical for economic survival.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">This century is going to see an era that will create an empire of the mind as opposed to one built of copper and steel. All our systems have to work well. Government has to work well and cannot be centrally driven. Dr. Harris believes that we need a Government that is agile, a private sector that is entrepreneurial and a university system that is flexible and entrepreneurial. All of these have to work together in the construction of the new empire of the mind. Ireland, he believes, has the potential to compete at that level if it can get these piers to connect.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Members must forgive my reading. I have an eye problem and I beg the indulgence of the House. I think our scriptwriters were talking to one another.</p>

        <speech by="#RoryKiely" as="#Cathaoirleach" eId="spk_201">

        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_499">Until I obtain a ruling from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, and given my current predicament, I intend to continue to operate as I am doing now.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Significantly, Dr. Harris has stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Our role at SFI is to be a catalyst and make those things happen. In the US the National Science Foundation was established and was one of the principal Government tools that helped shape the colleges and universities to create the research processes that are now the best in the world. It is that research system that has helped to fuel the industrial enterprise that still exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">It is good to know that Dr. Harris believes the universities in this country are well prepared and that there are individuals here willing to promote things with a passion. Speaking at the IMI in Killarney in April last he said:</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Allow me first to give you the brief on the Science Foundation Ireland. SFI has been charged by the Government to invest in the scientific and engineering fields underpinning bio-technology and information and communications technology. It is predicted that the market for bio-technology industries will rise to £250 billion by the year 2005 and support three million jobs in Europe. Research in bio-technology will affect health-care, pharmaceuticals, environmental management, agriculture, green science, economic goods, and food and drink businesses. It includes fields such as DNA chips, genomics, bio-sensors, drug delivery and bio-remediation.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The other area of SFI's investment is information and communications technology or ICT. This includes broadband, wireless and mobile transmission. It includes parallel processing systems, engineering for reliability of data transfer and wearable sensors. It also includes computer modelling, distributed networking, computer-based training, nano-scale assembly and human language understanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">He further pointed out:</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Thanks to satellites and fibre optic cables, ideas leap among people almost like lightning. Nowadays, through a terminal, a satellite and a decent battery or a plug in the wall, ideas can jump from an island to anywhere and likewise attract. The only limit now is the worth of the idea, the intelligence that uses it and the innovation that it creates.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">We all believe that this country is well positioned to succeed in a knowledge-driven economy and again Dr. Harris believes that we have nurtured the wealth of talent available in our young population. It is good to know he believes we have taken advantage of having an English-speaking population at a time when English is used to run world markets. We have also leveraged our free market democratic system, which promotes innovation and initiative. EU membership has been vitally important as well as the tax incentives that have helped to attract a decade's worth of multinational investment and encourage the development of a unique relationship with US companies. Equally important are the innovative State policies spearheaded by the Tánaiste's Department and Forfás. Successful industrial investment marketing efforts have been led by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Dr. Harris argues that Ireland has another important advantage in terms of its size. Other sources of competitive advantage are rapidly drying up. Include here is geographical position, which has been weakened by electronic commerce, reduced tariffs and lower barriers to foreign direct investment. The new technologies of the late 20th and early 21st centuries have shrunk the advantages that accrue to mere size. Ireland's small size should allow for efficiencies, partnerships and synergies not possible in larger countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Dr. Harris correctly points out that what we do now will set the way in which we develop for at least a generation. Complacency, slow decision-making and failure to keep pace with change have cost nations before. We must not let that happen. Due to the fact that we cannot afford to do everything at once, we need a national strategy. We should apply every possible resource at our disposal to build our education, research and technology base for speed, knowledge and competitiveness. The entire education system from primary level through postgraduate level is important as it is a systemic issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">In section 12 of the Bill, I notice something to which Members have referred in respect of previous legislation. I refer to the way that members – elected people – have strictures placed upon them. Perhaps the Tánaiste could outline the rationale behind this.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I echo what the Tánaiste said in recognising the importance of Science Foundation Ireland. I am delighted it is now, by means of the Bill, being established on a formal statutory basis.</p>

        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_512">I welcome the Tánaiste and her staff to the House for the debate on this important Bill. Dr. Harris will be delightfully embarrassed by the compliments rightly paid to him by Senator Coghlan. We are lucky to have a man of his eminence, as well as the other members of the board, involved with Science Foundation Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">No one can deny that the Irish economy has been an incredible success during the past ten years. Although that success has only been felt recently, the foundation of the Celtic tiger was laid a number of decades ago. For years, Ireland invested in education and research and, in this way, the wealth of talent available in the young population was nurtured.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The role of the Government, spearheaded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, was vital in the introduction of innovative policies. Forfás, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA have led the way in their successful industrial investment and marketing efforts. As a former Minister of State with special responsibility for trade and marketing, I realise it was vital to have new products in the market and that Ireland had to be at the forefront in this regard to maintain our level of trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Ireland has taken advantage of having an English-speaking population at a time when English is used to run world markets. It is also the language of the Internet. It has leveraged its free market democratic system which promotes innovation and initiative. EU membership has also been vitally important, as are the tax incentives that have helped to attract at least a decade's worth of multinational investment and foster our unique relationship with US companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">In spite of how well Ireland has done in the past ten years, the transformational demands of our time mean the challenge has only now begun. Without doubt, other nations will eat our lunch and leave us in the dust if we do not act immediately, quickly and with focus. Since the power of knowledge and human capital is so great today, Ireland now needs a national strategy to ensure its investments will produce the kinds of results that today's society demands, expects and needs. We are at the forefront in respect of the Internet and have to retain that level of excellence in designing and producing software, now synonymous with the growth and development of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">In February 2000 the Government approved the establishment of a national strategic research foundation, now known as Science Foundation Ireland, as a mechanism for the management, allocation, disbursal and evaluation of expenditure from the technology foresight fund. This fund was established with the very important aim of supporting research excellence in strategic technologies, particularly the development of world-class capabilities in the niche areas of information and communication technologies and biotechnology.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">The establishment of the fund and Science Foundation Ireland emanated from a number of studies carried out in the 1990s. These studies highlighted the fact that firms in the modern high-tech sectors of business, including IT, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, were more production-oriented than research and development-oriented and, therefore, more vulnerable to global market changes. It was recognised that as the global economy became more knowledge-based and more driven by research and development, the key to Ireland's continued success would be to reposition Irish industry higher up the economic value chain. With this in mind, Science Foundation Ireland, with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, placed this goal at the core of all policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">For the foundation to commence operations immediately, the Government agreed wisely that it could be established under the existing development Acts as a sub-board of Forfás. The bringing forward of this innovation represented a highly sensitive message by the Government. In 2001 Dr. William B. Harris was appointed director general of the foundation and a board of 12 members was established. I am thankful that people of Dr. Harris's ability came forward to provide their services for the board. The background of Dr. Harris, which I discovered on the Internet today, is quite spectacular and I know he will be very innovative in his position. I am delighted that he is present in the House today and I welcome him.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">To date, the board has met five times and I congratulate it on its work. Within the past 18 months the SFI has managed to establish a number of programmes with the overall goal of placing Ireland at the heart of global research and development. The last meeting of the board was held on 27 January. It does not meet very often because its members are spread throughout the world. I compliment the Minister and her Department on attracting such eminent and qualified specialists to serve Ireland in a very positive way.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The members of the SFI work hard to ensure Ireland will act as a magnet for new industrial development in the future. It helps to strengthen the foundations and prospects of existing firms in the area of research and development. Its programme seeks to upgrade the quality of faculty, student intake and graduate output of Irish universities to the benefit of the entire industrial development and promotion efforts of the Government and the development agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The purpose of the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill 2002 is to finally establish the foundation as a separate legal entity. It will ensure the foundation will continue as an agency of Forfás, while at the same time having the necessary autonomy and dynamism to proactively decide on and direct its programmes. The foundation has the responsibility of managing, allocating, monitoring and evaluating expenditure of the technology foresight fund. The board of the foundation will continue to have 12 members and will include the director general who will be appointed for a period of five years and may be repappointed for a second term. The board may establish committees to assist and advise it on the performance of any of its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The usual provisions regarding disclosure of interests and information are contained in the Bill. It is intended to bring the foundation within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. The Bill obliges the foundation to prepare strategy statements every five years and a work programme each year. An annual report must be prepared and submitted to the Minister at the end of each financial year and all accounts submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">I welcome and support the Bill wholeheartedly. The establishment of Science Foundation Ireland as a separate entity will ensure Ireland is at the forefront of scientific developments in information and communications technology and biotechnology. It has already attracted some of the world's most eminent scientists, proving our ability to attract the best from around the world. These scientists are without doubt the future of Irish innovation and research. Through them we will continue to build our greatest resource of all – human talent.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Ireland has had very inventive people and we are responsible for great developments in science and technology. One example is the great telescope at Birr Castle, which was the largest telescope of its era and indicates how innovative we have been. We missed the industrial revolution that occurred in Great Britain but we have, through education, taken part in the most modern developments that have taken place in the world. Furthermore, the publication of this legislation marks a milestone in the ongoing development and growth of first-rate scientific research in Ireland. In setting up the SFI the Government has committed itself to building an ecosystem of world-class research. By establishing the foundation on a statutory basis through this Bill the Government is providing the SFI with a solid foundation to ensure this commitment is achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">I congratulate the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for brining the Bill to the Seanad and allowing the SFI to be established on a statutory basis. I compliment her on her excellent work promoting Irish industry and trade throughout the world. She has certainly put considerable effort into her portfolio and the SFI will be of tremendous assistance to the Government in promoting research and development. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_206">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_529">This Bill is most welcome. The initiative the Minister took some years ago regarding science and technology and the need to maintain and promote research and development has been magnificent. She is to be congratulated warmly on having managed to ring-fence the funding for research, which is deemed to be of great importance economically and industrially, and for the manner in which she has dealt with the matter in her Department. The efforts made during the last round of what are described as "adjustments" must have been ferocious because in every other area of research the most appalling things have happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I was interested to hear Senator Coghlan say that Dr. Harris claims the universities are well prepared. They were well prepared, but that is no longer the case since the programme for research in third level institutions has been decimated. The Minister must look at what is happening in some of the other departments if she wants to ensure that Science Foundation Ireland is a success. We have recruited magnificent people to the foundation. The Minister and I attended the opening, which she performed, of Trinity's nanoscience technology unit where she saw the international calibre of its recruits. Science Foundation Ireland will be like a beached whale if people are not available to feed into it. The universities were encouraged to involve academic staff in research, but as soon as they did so huge amounts of capital funding for third level institutions was cut back. There have been serious cutbacks in the research programmes of virtually every department.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">I am delighted that Senator O'Rourke is here, though I am sure she will not remember one of the first debates in which I was involved in this House. She was at the Department of Enterprise and Employment when Digital collapsed in Galway. I told her in this House that she should try to hold on to the research and development element of the operation. Such units take a long time to build up and one is bound to find other firms which recognise their value. In the case of Digital, Boston Scientific had taken over the research and development unit after about six weeks. I am sure the Leader remembers that important event.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I am dismayed to see what is happening in other areas in which excellence should be aimed at as it is from these areas that people should be moving to Science Foundation Ireland. We are coasting along on the idea that we have done well in the past, which we feel means a huge effort does not have to be put in again. In science and research one must realise every day that one are in direct competition with people in different parts of the world. We cannot have an on-off scenario whereby the funding is stopped and recommenced after three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I disagree completely with Senator Lydon's comments on the Internet. We have fallen terribly far behind with regard to broadband. I am no expert, but I am constantly told we are at a serious disadvantage due to the fact that more investment in broadband was not made over the last five years. I could spend the afternoon listing areas in which there has been a reduction in funding. The higher education authorities have parked their research programmes, as have the research councils and the Department of Education and Science. Teagasc funding has been cut back, as has the Department of Agriculture and Food's food research measure. Nothing is an island unto itself and these programmes feed into each other. The funding for research and development at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has been cut. The Health Research Bureau, which is very close to my heart, has seen its funding go down. On Second Stage of the Protection of the Environment Bill this morning, we all agreed that we needed to put effort into research, yet the EPA which produced a splendid report on drinking water in 2001 has had its funding cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">It is fine to talk about the wonderful Science Foundation Ireland. The credentials of its scientists are amazing and the Minister is quite right to say that international firms will feed money and projects to it. However, we will encounter a serious personnel problem if people within our universities and other research institutions have to live with an on-off funding policy. Sometimes the amounts in question are not very great, but research is a soft target and some do not understand how difficult it is to recommence programmes which have been suspended.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I implore the Minister to take a tough line on this at Cabinet. She was right in saying that our sustained economic growth and prosperity will depend upon establishing a culture of scientific and technological innovation, a high level of research and development and a globally competitive knowledge-based economy. The Minister further stated that this repositioning is essential if we are to provide sustainable, high-quality, well-paid jobs in the future. I could not agree more. She said we must strengthen the scientific foundations on which we develop high productivity, high technology and market driven, knowledge-intensive investment, including start-ups in the industrial and services sectors. This is right, but it will not happen simply through Science Foundation Ireland. We must protect the other areas which are extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The Minister spoke about the fact that biotechnology will play a pivotal role in social and industrial development, as physics and chemistry did following the Second World War. However, physics and chemistry are very important in the education of those who enter the biotechnology field. The Minister said we must meet the challenge of making science and engineering careers attractive to students. Engineering has been seriously under-subscribed for many years, but lowering maths requirements will do no good. Maths must be got up to standard within schools, not by providing for a complementary year. We must find ways to encourage people to stay with physics and chemistry as undergraduates. There is a significant drop-off rate in the numbers taking those subjects when they come to make choices in scientific courses in the third or fourth years of study. At the opening of the nanoscience technology unit, I noted that the backgrounds of the scientists involved included primary degrees in physics or chemistry. These subjects were not just important after the Second World War, they are very important still.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Last year, Trinity ran a very innovative programme. We had lost a lot of chemistry students after senior freshman year, prior to the third year of study. Dr. Sylvia Draper came up with the idea of having a competition whereby students would be divided into groups which would create television promotions explaining to the public the basis of scientific ideas and the need for environmental conservation. I was kindly asked to be one of the judges of the competition and I saw that initiatives of this sort work. Last year was the first time that chemistry in junior sophister year was over-subscribed. We have to be imaginative in our efforts to get people to stay with these disciplines, even if such efforts seem small and simple. The lack of emphasis on basic science in the Minister's speech is worrying. Physics and chemistry are the basic disciplines to which we must attract people before we can promote them to advanced science such as biotechnology.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The Minister said that we must provide incentives that encourage graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and non-tenured researchers to remain active in research and engineering within Ireland while recruiting and retaining outstanding researchers from abroad. It is an important point. Last year a student obtained a first in physics, but to my dismay he went to South Korea to make computer games. He said it would be very interesting.</p>

          <p eId="para_543">Apart from the nuclear industry, I do not believe there is much industry in North Korea.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">We give serious consideration to giving encouragement teachers of mathematics, applied mathematics, physics and chemistry because, unfortunately, a considerable number of those who teach these subjects do not possess a primary degree in the relevant discipline. These are difficult subjects to teach at the best of times and, particularly in light of the requirements of the modern curriculum, it must be very difficult for those who hold primary degrees in other subjects, such as English or history, to do so. The teachers' unions do not agree with teachers of difficult subjects being paid more, which is one of the reasons it is difficult to retain them. Perhaps the Minister will discuss the position with the Minister for Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">If students are to pursue these disciplines, they must be well taught. We all remember from our schooldays that we enjoyed courses taught by teachers with an enthusiasm for and knowledge of the subject. However, it was uninspiring if teachers confined themselves to reading from manuals, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I strongly support the Minister in her endeavours because this issue is of enormous importance to industry in this country and to our development on the world stage. We have managed to secure an important niche in these areas. It is why pharmaceutical industries locate here. While they are attracted by the tax breaks and incentives, they would not be here in the absence of a good workforce and we must ensure that it the members of that workforce remain here.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Universities made major efforts to try to get people involved in research, but they now consider that the rug has been pulled from under them. Organisation such as Teagasc, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health Research Bureau have done excellent work. People had expectations, but the so-called spending adjustments have removed them. This is a major blow and it will not be easy to secure the return of the many good people who became involved. It is necessary to ensure that they are given some idea regarding their tenure, be it five or ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The idea that research does not take long must be challenged. A period of 20 years for a programme can be very short. Fortunately, Science Foundation Ireland realises that some projects will take a long time to complete and it is addressing this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">I applaud the Minister for what she has achieved. However, I implore her to urge the Government to do something or she will otherwise have secured a loan for Science Foundation Ireland which will be unable to attract the ideas and people it needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Many years ago I read an article in the <i>Lancet</i> about the value of coffee breaks. The article in question referred to people from different disciplines in hospitals meeting to complain about what they were trying and failing to do and indicated that the cross-fertilisation of ideas at such gatherings frequently brought about solutions. We have come much further since then in that we now realise the importance of teamwork, ideas from other disciplines and national and international conferences. I would hate to see a regression in this area and I rely on the Minister to tell the Government that the spending adjustments must be re-visited in order to ensure that something is done to restore some of the research projects that have been cancelled.</p>

          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_556">A recent European study on innovation showed that 78% of sales in the information technology sector were based on products that were less than two years old. Companies such as Siemens state that over 50% of their sales are based on products that are less than five years old. This rate of change is a result of five main external pressures, including technology, economic development, legislation, the environmental concerns of citizens and social change.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The ability of a company to respond to change and compete in the international marketplace is today seen as the life blood of modern economies. In its studies, the OECD has shown that over 50% of economic growth can be attributed to developments in technology. It also shows that the sectors which contribute most to this economic growth and job creation are those in which high technology is developed and applied in products and services and where there is a presence of a strong scientific base.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">In this modern era, most technologies are associated with various fields of science. Electronics are related to the physical sciences, pharmaceutical technologies to the biological sciences and software to mathematics, etc. Future advances in technology and our economic development and job creation will rely on a detailed understanding of these sciences and of the techniques used in the advancement of science. This is where Science Foundation Ireland comes into play.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">There are five areas where scientific development will play a critical role in the future of this country. First, it will help companies compete in the international marketplace. In future, increasing globalisation of trade and European Union restrictions on fiscal and monetary policy will intensify competition from other countries seeking to outperform Ireland as a competitive location for doing business. The companies who will compete on the international market will be those with the best knowledge, best technologies and the best business networks. We must be realistic and recognise that despite our present economic success, a small economy such as Ireland's cannot invest without limit in all areas of research, technology and innovation. Spending must, therefore, be focused on those areas that can contribute most to the country's long-term economic development.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Industry and related international investment are becoming increasingly knowledge based as new research and technologies translate into global, marketable products and services. The key to Ireland's continued success will be to ensure that our development agencies, including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, successfully promote the location and development of firms whose competitive advantage is based on knowledge, innovation, technology and related skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">There is a need to focus on building new sources of competitive advantage for indigenous companies and ensuring that Ireland becomes one of Europe's most attractive locations for knowledge based enterprise, both Irish and foreign owned. The outcome of this would be to achieve the greatest economic and social benefit and to sustain industrial competitiveness in the long term. The skills of the labour force can be developed by investing in personnel with world-class research excellence at the critical mass required to give Ireland an international reputation in selected technological niches and, in particular, in information and communication technologies and biotechnology.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Scientific development will play a role in the future of the country by the provision of information for policy and legislation. Good policies require good information. The topics which come before us in this House more and more require expert scientific opinions. Winston Churchill said scientists should be on tap, not on top. In Ireland we have no problem with scientists being on tap to provide us with the information we need for our policies and on top in their own scientific fields. This would be the ideal scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">What of the role of Science Foundation Ireland? Enabling this to happen in future years will require a significant upgrading of the sources of such knowledge, innovation and technology by investing in related research and development personnel and activities. The funding put in place is necessary to develop a world class research capability in strategic technological advances, to underpin the future development and competitiveness of Irish owned industry, to facilitate the undertaking of research and development in this country by multinational companies in order to support the further development of the sector in Ireland, to attract more high technology companies to Ireland and to enhance the environment for the creation of more Irish owned high-tech start-ups.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">The establishment of the foundation will send a strong signal to the international community and international investors that the Government is intent on sustaining and improving the conditions to maintain recent economic progress and enhance future growth prospects. Science, technology, research and innovation are the key words of the future. We must build the structures which supprt research excellence, enhance our ability to compete at the pinnacle of knowledge and produce the people through our education system who will take on the new challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">A cornerstone of this future is building our research capability in our universities, institutes and enterprises. This is the research infrastructure which will make it possible. The Government has been committed to getting the environment for business right and, I am confident, will continue with that commitment. There is a strong trend towards the movement of manufacturing to lower cost economies. This reflects the fact that Ireland is no longer a low wage economy and must make the transition to higher added value products and services that allow us to sustain and grow incomes. A key part of this process is to recognise the importance of innovation in helping enterprise to move up the value chain and to create a flow of technology based firms capable of competing on export markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Central to this vision of Ireland as a country driving technological change is Science Foundation Ireland. The foundation will support projects in key technologies strategic to long-term national development and is a vital element in the Government's strategy to move Irish industry higher up the value chain.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">It is difficult to predict the future. How to select or orientate the scientific fields is a difficult decision for any nation. Given Ireland's size, it is important that we focus our science in a number of selected fields. Forfás has identified these fields as biotechnology and information and communication technologies. This is wise. At the same time we should not neglect the other scientific fields. It is important that Irish scientists establish links with the best scientific teams internationally. This should be encouraged through programmes such as the European Union research and development programmes. For example, the new EU research and development programme, the Sixth Framework Programme, announced its first call for proposals in December 2002. I hope the Irish scientific community is responding to this important opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The path from today's science to tomorrow's economic growth and jobs is a complex one. It involves universities, research and development institutions, Government agencies, financiers and so on. Science is an important first step. It is important that all the links in the chain are considered. Funding of science plus the knowledge flow to the applied sciences and engineers is as important as the funding of science itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Last week the European Commission's Directorate General Enterprise published an innovation policy study. The report states:</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Innovation in a knowledge based economy is diverse and pervasive. It is not just based on research or science and technology or enterprise and ingenuity. Innovation also depends on organisational, social, economic, marketing and other knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Basic science produces new knowledge which must be protected. It is our most important asset for the future. The protection of intellectual property must be a critical part of new science.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">It will be clear from what I have said that we are placing new pressures on the scientific community. In the past being a good scientist meant producing new knowledge, publishing this work and presenting research results to the scientific community. The scientists of the future will continue in this vein. However, they will also have to be more politically aware of the future impact of their research and more commercially and socially aware of the road from science to economic growth and from science to job creation. Science Foundation Ireland can play a major role in selecting the scientific priorities for Ireland through foresight studies, funding of basic sciences and providing the scientific community with the support it needs in its future challenges and adventures.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I congratulate the Tánaiste on bringing forward the Bill. She has shown a clear vision of where this economy has to go and set in train a process that will secure the future of the economy and our greatest natural asset, the people. In the future we will look back and realise that this initiative was a cornerstone of our economic development. I urge all those concerned to embrace this new challenge enthusiastically.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I conclude by quoting the conclusion of the EU innovation study published last week: "There will be a need for leadership, education, examples, guidance and co-ordination of services". This is a good slogan for Science Foundation Ireland. I have no hesitation is fully supporting the Bill and encourage Members to support also.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_217">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_575">We welcome the Bill and the idea of Science Foundation Ireland. Anything I say is to be seen in the context of an enthusiastic welcome for the concept. My motivation in speaking is to be constructive and add to a debate which is a little detached from the world of politics. There are issues to be debated concerning science, technology, innovation, invention, research and development. Because I know the Tánaiste has a long interest in this area I am quite certain these issues have been talked about, even though they may not surface.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">We must be careful not to tie ourselves too firmly to the concept of national competitiveness. The best economist currently writing about international trade, Paul Krugman, is on record as saying he does not believe in the idea of nations having comparative advantage. He believes in companies within nations having comparative advantage and that to focus on a collective view of competitiveness, based on the only indices that can be measured collectively, such as, wage cost increases or inflation, is to distort what real competitiveness is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">People in Ireland have a habit of choosing indices that are easiest to measure – usually wage growth and perhaps inflation and a couple of other things – and using them to make a statement of some sort. Nobody would dispute that continuing high inflation or continuing unrealistic wage increases will have an overall effect. However, that is not the same as looking at competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The idea of establishing a well-funded, world quality research facility here is extremely good. The only thing that I, as an academic, could say is that it is a bit late to do so. That is not the Tánaiste's fault, it is the consequence of inaction on the part of successive Governments and a shortage of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">In terms of the proportion of our GDP, we are at the lower end of developed countries. Given that we have the resources and as we develop our capacity – I accept that we cannot merely throw money at it – and a critical mass, I would like us to expand, as a proportion of GDP, our commitment to research and development. We are discussing two words, "research" and "development", and there is an issue to be debated in terms of how one becomes the other. This is an important concern to which I will return.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">If we are to develop an ability for world-class research, we must remember that world-class research and development is the apex of the pyramid that begins in education. The noisy protest outside the House today is another part of that pyramid, as is the problem of inadequate buildings in primary schools, etc. World-class research and development cannot be developed in isolation from our education facilities. Those facilities are, as the logicians would say, a necessary but not sufficient condition for world-class research. Nevertheless, they are necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">I work in third level education, which is meant to be the area of science and technology. If a bright young student looks at the physical environment, the extra-curricular facilities, etc., in traditional universities and those in institutes of technology, it is difficult argue that these institutions are equal in terms of status, merit and quality. There continues to be a view that students who attend to ITs do not need the same range of supports and services. The careers service and the support services tend to be less developed. The medical services are also often less developed. I would not dispute the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> sports facilities, though they tend to fall behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">In the case of institution at which I teach, Senator Minihan will be aware that the buildings are not exactly of the quality that would induce bright young students to think about careers in science and technology. There is a need – I do not want to make a special plea about this matter – to make maximum use of all the facilities and skills available to us. There is a need to persuade bright and imaginative young people that careers in science and technology provide just as much – I believe more – stimulation, challenge and capacity for both financial reward and personal satisfaction as many other careers.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I am somewhat taken aback by the number of young people who want to go into business, but who are not keen to produce goods that will be saleable in the marketplace. The latter is the point to which science and technology ought to bring one. We have to encourage people to see that if they are interested in the area of the commercial market, science and technology is every bit as valid an option as some mainstream or business or marketing course. Science and technology, properly integrated in a modern society, is as much a part of the business world as training in accountancy or marketing. One cannot be done without the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">In the context of schools and science and technology, it is worth looking at the tables produced in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently regarding which schools sent people in the largest numbers to particular universities. I note that the ITs were not asked to participate. I presume readers of <i>The Irish Times</i> would not be as interested in information relating these institutions. On the other hand, the schools at the top of the list for sending people to university are almost universally absent from the lists of those that produce prize winners at the Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition. Which schools provide the better education in the long term to encourage young people to see science and technology as useful, entertaining and fulfilling?</p>
          <p eId="para_585">We have to consider that issue and persuade our young people that the sort of education which focuses on imagination and creativity is as important and valuable as the so-called education which focuses exclusively on gaining maximum points in the six easiest subjects – some of which are a long way from science and technology – in which it is possible to obtain points. I do not want to dwell on the comparative ease with which one can obtain As in science subjects, because science is not one of the areas which is identified as comparatively easy. This issue is worthy of a great deal more study by the Minister's Department and the Department of Education and Science in terms of looking at the degree to which the perceived ease of obtaining high points is actually pushing young people away from science and technology. This is extremely important because it is from among this pool of people that the Irish contribution to a successful endeavour will be drawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">With regard to development in the area of science and technology, I am reminded of a wonderful phrase used by the person who took my place in the Seanad for a number of years and filled it with considerable distinction. I refer to Joe Lee, who contrasted the performance principle with the possession principle as they apply to Ireland. He stated that we tend to operate on the basis of the principle that "What we have we hold", rather than on rewarding performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I am venturing into difficult territory because I work in a sector of third level education which, rightly or otherwise, believes itself to be rhetorically equal but which, practically speaking, is seen as the poor relation of the third level education sector. Let me provide examples. The previous Government set up foresight panels which were important and useful. I went through the membership of those panels and counted only two academics from the entire institute of technology sector. They were dominated by university academics, all of whom I am sure were people of considerable ability, and by people from industry. The principle behind these panels was fine. However, the idea seemed quite wrong that, in the sector of education which concentrates and specialises in science and technology, there should be such a small number of people who would have any contribution to make in terms of considering how the world will evolve. If one looks at the composition of the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, one will find that the same applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Let us consider the position of the foresight panel on pharmaceuticals, to which Tánaiste referred. There are two stages to research and development: first, the identification of a new idea or invention that will do something not done heretofore; and, second, turning the latter into a commercial product. One of the problems Britain, for example, has had for the past 30 years is that it has done well in discovering new things which have then been promptly commercialised on the other side of the Atlantic. The intermediary role of taking something from the initial discovery to commercial product involves more than scientists, it involves the profession – engineering – in which I, to a certain extent, am involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">It is astonishing that there was not a single engineer on the pharmaceutical foresight panel. The development of pharmaceuticals involves two things: first, the obvious basic research; and, second, how one makes a product in a way which is capable of meeting modern quality standards and which is commercially attractive. I find the omission of an entire sector of third level education and, in many cases, the omission of a major profession in the productive sector astonishing. I think it is a reflection of what I just described as Joe Lee's categorisation of the possession principle over the performance principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I suggest that Tánaiste give consideration to this matter. In terms of the composition of the board she is about to establish, people who have performed rather than those with particular titles should be appointed because we need to move away from the type of distinctions which were wrong 20 years ago and which are now meaningless.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Nobody would dispute the two areas to which the Tánaiste referred in respect of the SFI, namely, biotechnology and information and communications technology. I am, however, surprised that neither the foresight panels nor the Bill have focused on the area of the environment and sustainability. I know the Tánaiste referred to environmental protection, but one of the most fundamental transformations in all areas of economic activity over the next 40 or 50 years will be not only treating things at the end of the pipe, which is one way, but totally reconsidering the way we do things, make things and organise our transport system. This is so fundamental that it appears there is considerable room for innovation and for world class research. It is an area of great uncertainty and, therefore, one at which to look.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Nicholas Ashford, who works in MIT, makes a distinction between invention and innovation. A world class research centre will, I hope, be successful at invention. Innovation is the commercial application of invention. There are two kinds innovation, there is the stepwise form and there is the kind of quantum leap made when something new appears. One could look at the development of personal computers since the first model came on the market as stepwise innovation, whereas the first PC was a fundamental innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Our job is to move from just finding out and discovering new things to making sure that they are made here in the future. I agree with one of the points Senator Minihan raised, that is, the protection of intellectual property rights. Perhaps the patent laws need to be looked at in terms of timescale. However, giving software copyright protection for 70 years is one of the single biggest inhibitions to real innovation. It was illogical at the time and it is more illogical now. To treat software as if it was creative writing is nothing more than a protection for the dominant corporation which dominates the world software market. It was the wrong decision to make and it should be reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">A 20 year patent is more than adequate. I believe in patent law, but do not believe copyright law should have been effectively subverted largely to protect the dominance of one big company.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGerardHanafin" eId="spk_218">
          <from>Mr. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_595">I welcome the Tánaiste and I support the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill 2002. Senator Ryan reminded me of my history class at school when we looked at ancient copyright. I do not remember which Ard Rí issued the decree to the effect, "To every cow its calf and to every book its copy." That is how they decided copyright in times past. Naturally, we have to amend for future generations and do not want to see monopolies hold copyrights indefinitely, particularly when it is for the good of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Notwithstanding that, the Bill provides for the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland. The new body will be an agency of Forfás. The Bill also provides for the amendment of the Industrial Development Acts 1986 to 1998 and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company (Amendment) Act 1986. These amendments are mainly concerned with the updating of certain grant instruments and related financial limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The main function of the foundation is to promote and develop the best research capability in strategic areas of scientific endeavour which concern economic and social benefit and long-term competitiveness. These areas include information and communications technology and biotechnology. It is intended that the foundation will attract research teams and individual researchers of the highest standard to carry out research in Ireland. The Government established Science Foundation Ireland to help to retain outstanding research scientists and engineers in the information and communications technology and biotechnology industrial sectors in Ireland and to recruit leading international researchers to academic positions here.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Following the technology foresight process, which was completed in 1999, the Government, as part of the national development plan, allocated €635 million to SFI in February 2000. The Government gave SFI responsibility to invest this money consistently and substantially in those individuals most likely to generate new knowledge, leading edge technologies and competitive enterprises. The aim of this investment is to help Ireland to diversify and expand its economy through recruiting and retaining creative individuals with advanced research experience in areas critical to the development of a knowledge based economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The future competitiveness of the Irish economy will increasingly be based on the quality of the intellectual capital available to stimulate innovation, excellence and entrepreneurship. In strengthening the country's intellectual capital, we want to use the resulting capability to create a reservoir of ideas, skills and talent which will profit Ireland in the future. To meet this goal, SFI will work in partnership with all third level institutions to augment both the quality and the amount of research carried out on a competitive basis. The best way to do this is by investing in creative and successful teachers and scholars based in these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">By the end of 2002, SFI committed approximately €200 million to information and communications technology and biotechnology projects and teams in Ireland. Since its establishment, SFI has instituted five research programmes and invested in almost 60 scientists and their associated teams. These teams will be based throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">By 2006, Ireland will have invested €2 billion in the 21st century in science and research development. To obtain maximum return on this investment, Ireland should develop a coherent national research strategy. This is imperative at a time when nations which do not develop knowledge are doomed to package it as manufacturers and to pay for it with their standard of living. Thanks to the hard work already done, Ireland has become a knowledge driven nation. It must now become a knowledge driving nation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_602">I welcome the Tánaiste and the Bill. It is quite likely that there will be a great deal of discussion about many past Irish scientists, but Ireland has never been a scientific country. I attended Newbridge College at which Fr. Casey was my science teacher and which had one of the best laboratories of any school in the 1950s. Fr. Casey was later appointed professor of science at Maynooth. Woe betide anybody at Newbridge College who did not know about Boyle's law which was formulated by Sir Robert Boyle, a famous Irish scientist. I accept that there have been famous Irish scientists in the past, but they were few and far between.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I wish to focus on the underlying aims of the legislation and the way we may test our seriousness in regard to them. The starting point for Ireland is that it is trying to change because it has never been a country noted for its noted for its scientists. That is despite the catalogue of notable Irish scientists over the centuries who tend to be dusted down and brought into the open for debates such as this. We are flying in the face of reality if we try to persuade ourselves and others that Ireland has a strong scientific tradition.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The English novelist C. P. Snow wrote about the division of Britain into two cultures: one that was science-based; and the other that was based on the humanities. He saw this division as being a real problem for Britain in the area of science. We also have this problem, but in a more extreme sense because we do not have twin cultures. We have a single humanities-based culture and science has never obtained a proper role in the Irish academic tradition. This has become a serious problem because of the kind of economy we have built within the last generation. We see the future of our country as a knowledge-based economy, which actually means science and technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">When my eldest son, Eamonn, finished school he decided to pursue commerce and economics studies in Trinity College. I remember telling Tom Hardiman, who at the time was chairman of the science and technology board, what my son was going to study and inquired angrily "Do you not realise the future is in science and technology? Why would anybody waste their time doing anything else?" It was great to have people like Tom Hardiman arguing the case for science and technology 20 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The dilemma facing us is that if we are to prosper in future we must become involved in the business of creating science instead of passively talking about obtaining science and technology from others. We have reached our current position being takers in the science and technology sector, but, unfortunately, that is a dead end for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">It has long been the objective of IDA Ireland and of industrial policy generally to move up through the value chain with regard to our export industries. For over a decade, IDA Ireland has engaged in a great deal of pushing and shoving to encourage multinationals to establish research facilities here as a springboard for future growth. For the most part, however, that campaign failed, although I know there were some exceptions to which the Tánaiste referred. The reason it failed is the main reason underpinning the Bill. The multinationals who are at the leading edge of science want to establish their research laboratories in an environment that will nurture them. They want to plant units like that in a science-friendly place, rather than putting them on barren ground where they will receive no support from the surrounding environment. When they looked at Ireland, they noted not only that we lacked a scientific tradition and culture but also that we failed in the past to support new scientific research.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">For many years, all our support for third level education went into the business of turning out undergraduates. The State refused to become involved in supporting research, which is the second essential pillar of university activity. I must admit that many of us were just as much at fault as others in not recognising the benefits of research which, by and large, was left to fend for itself when it came to financial support. That has had predictable consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">It is to the great credit of the Tánaiste and the Government that they eventually realised that this could not continue and that, by failing to invest in science, we were putting the future growth of our economy at risk. From that realisation came the commitment to invest over €700 million in scientific research over the period of the current national economic plan. Scientific Foundation Ireland is the vehicle through which that money will be disbursed. The sum of €700 million may seem enormous, but it is not that large when one considers the task we face. In a few short years we will have to convince a sceptical world that we can become a world-class centre for scientific research. We will have succeeded if people come to regard Ireland as a leading international scientific centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">In a real sense we are engaged in a credibility campaign and to succeed we will have to do much more than just catch up with the pack. Instead, we will have to establish a leadership position in a number of specialised fields that we carefully select as having the greatest potential for the country. We want to make Ireland a leader to the extent that it will attract leading scientists in specific fields. They will come here not because of our lifestyle, which many people have done in the past, but because this is the centre of their particular scientific world. It is a bold and highly ambitious plan and, as such, I applaud it and wish it every success.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">In welcoming the Bill, however, I want to sound a note of warning. The structures created by the legislation, important as they are, will not ensure the success of the project itself. The structures on their own will prove utterly useless if they are not fully backed up by the necessary resources. At a minimum, it should be a five year programme and those who buy into it must be convinced that it will be supported for the full length of the Government's term of office and beyond. The credibility of the entire project will be fatally undermined if the Government does not deliver the promised funds. I realise that we can only make certain promises and I know the Tánaiste will do her best, but that credibility is important because the entire project depends upon it. I would like the Tánaiste to provide an assurance that such support will be guaranteed for the duration and that this ambitious project will not be allowed to fall foul of the cost-cutters in the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">When the Book of Estimates was published, I remember hearing that the amounts being set aside for supporting scientific research were to be put on hold for this year. Perhaps the Tánaiste might correct me on that point. If that is so, however, we may as well throw our hats at the project here and now. There is no point passing legislation such as that before us if we are not prepared to put our money where our mouths are. What is involved here is a credibility campaign in which we are trying to convince a sceptical world with promises of our best intentions. That campaign will be fatally undermined if any doubts arise about our determination to carry through fully all we have said we will do.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The Tánaiste's heart is behind the project and I know she can only make a certain number of promises. However, given her enthusiasm and dedication, she will be anxious to make it succeed. I hope the Tánaiste will be able to put my mind at rest on this crucial point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_220">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_614">I welcome the legislation the Tánaiste has brought before the House. I have been convinced for a long time of the importance, as well as the previous neglect, of scientific research and development. I listened to Senator Quinn with interest and I agree with some of his points, in particular that we cannot be purely takers. However, I would take issue with his view of history. He is accurate in what he said about independent Ireland, but – and this is perhaps one of the costs of independence – from the 17th century to the early 20th century many Irish people made considerable contributions to science. For example, the Parsons' turbine and the telescope were invented during the period in question, Boyle's law was formulated and an interesting group, the Dublin Philosophical Society, was formed and eventually became the Royal Dublin Society. Post-independence Ireland was cut off from that tradition and it is now a question of moving up the field and getting among the leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I must declare an interest in that two members of my family are involved in basic research. My sister is involved in the area of mathematics and has benefited from the Forfás grants which enabled her to attend mathematical conferences in, for example, Poland and my daughter is involved in the area of genetics and biotechnology. It is interesting that the Trinity genetics department was originally founded by the Irish Sugar Company. That application has established a considerable reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">I take issue with Senator Ryan who stated that the schools which were near the top of the list in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>, with all the reservations one might have about that. I am on the council of Alexandra College, a school which is high on that list and which won the Young Scientist of the Year award in 1981 and 1991.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The final interest I must declare is that in the late 1970s I worked for three years as an official in the area of science policy at the Department of Foreign Affairs. During that period I had the opportunity to get to know people in the scientific community, understand some of what was happening and gain an insight into the peculiar difficulties involved in decision-making in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">If we are discussing penalty points, rates or agricultural grants, most of us who have done some study can understand what is happening. However, there are areas of science that are much more impenetrable to the politicians, civil servants and, dare I say it, State agencies. That could lead one to the fatal mistake of believing that it is, therefore, less important or an optional extra when, in fact, the opposite is true.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">One initiative from the period to which I refer that became a great success in the applied area is the national microelectronics centre in Cork. Difficult though it is, one must try to select and back winners. When winners emerge, they may need support. It would be wrong to think, particularly when one considers what has happened in the past ten years, that this has been solely an initiative put in place by previous Governments or the State itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">I could not let this debate continue without paying a warm tribute to Mr. Chuck Feeney – his name is now public knowledge but for a long period he was anonymous – an Irish American who played a considerable supportive role in the peace process. He made an enormous contribution to building up the scientific and research capacity of practically every university in the country. I cannot think of one third level institution I have visited at which he did not make a big difference. We should be enormously grateful for that. Having had the bar raised to a new level, we must now take on the responsibility and ensure further progress. We cannot necessarily expect future benevolence, but Mr. Feeney had a vision for this country which, I am glad to say, Governments bought into. His role must be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">At the risk of being thought mischievous, I must say that I am somewhat surprised that such an important Bill is being introduced by the Tanáiste as opposed to the Minister for Education and Science. For as long as I can remember, responsibility for science has moved around from Department to Department. There is a slight anomaly in having a Minister for Education and Science and yet having this important initiative introduced by the Tánaiste. I am not criticising that attribution of responsibility. It may be, with one caveat, the most sensible thing to do in the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">Many people call me an academic. I have never been an academic, apart from obtaining a PhD at one stage.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_626">I have one reservation. I have given some examples – the areas of genetics and microelectronics – where making the connection between basic science and a utilitarian application has worked. When Benjamin Franklin carried out his electricity experiments in the 1750s or the first balloon flight was made at Versailles, did people realise that the world would be totally transformed as a result?</p>
          <p eId="para_627">I know the Tánaiste does not favour the concept of a planned economy and the type of thinking that previously held sway in certain countries in eastern Europe. However, there is a danger in believing that one can select all the winners in the area we are discussing. Science is universal, it is not national. We must focus on areas of significance and importance to us and on developments which might produce things of relevance. However, we should not ignore areas of excellence which may be developing at random and in which we can make a real contribution and build up a strength.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">I appeal to those involved in administering this area not to be 100% utilitarian. I am not sure the latter is possible where basic research is concerned because, in a sense, the people carrying out that research are different from those who carry out the application. One can never exactly be sure to what basic research will lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">This is an important initiative. I appeal to the Tánaiste – like other Members I am concerned about the health of the economy and the fact that nothing is possible without the necessary finance – to maintain the priority in this area. Many of those involved in scientific researches have careers that span several different countries and systems. If people are moving to Canada or elsewhere, they tend to compare facilities in different countries. There is more work to be done in improving the facilities. I know it costs money, but we need the facilities in the areas on which we are focusing in order to be at the cutting edge. The Government will have my support in achieving that.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_630">I welcome the Tanáiste. It is appropriate that she should bring this important legislation to this House. Our distinguished audience in the Visitors Gallery and anyone else listening to proceedings could not fail to be impressed at the level of debate and the wide-ranging depth of knowledge displayed. The debate was held in an remarkable atmosphere, notable for the absence of rancour. There was unanimity regarding the thrust of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The Tánaiste will recall that I was a member of the Cabinet when the distinguished chairman voiced his ideas at a Cabinet meeting and we fully discussed the matter. I was very struck by the imagination and "go where no man has gone before" attitude which led to this idea. No doubt that type of boldness has been characteristic of the membership of the committee, the council and this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">I commend the Government and the Tánaiste, who has followed the matter through, for the breadth of experience she has garnered in the make-up of the council, which is very important. We all think our own country is wonderful – it is a good attribute to think well of one's countrymen and women – but for a bold endeavour such as this, it is necessary to broaden one's horizon. The Tánaiste has done this in the make-up of the council. My colleague, Senator Leyden, a former Minister of State, has done much research in this regard. The qualifications and experience of members of the council, including the qualifications and experience of our people, will give the board a huge boost. Much of this work is of a voluntary nature. Many members of the board have very busy lives and they bring their valuable experience to the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I do not like the division between science and the humanities, which is an entirely wrong educational concept in relation to how one leads one's life. Surely one cannot be a broad based scientist or researcher if one does not have a good basic education and a dream to enable one to envisage, read and reflect on literature while turning one's mind to other aspects. During the debate it struck me that this note was coming across, notably in the contributions of Senators Ryan and Mansergh. To be a scientist, it is necessary to be educated, not just in the pure art of science. One must have a broad vision, otherwise one would come to a very rough end.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">It is remarkable that we have taken this very bold step. Throughout the centuries, learning in the purest academic sense has been the keystone of our development as a nation. For many centuries we travelled or our ancestors spent what pittance they had in ensuring their young people got a decent education. Therefore, our knowledge spread throughout the world. It is the basis for what we are doing here today and we must continue with the dream. One needs to have a sense of adventure and daring – the Tánaiste has it in spades – and a determination to carry out this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">We should not be content to take in just the firms that will give the best return – we all want that – and supply them with our knowledge. We must keep moving on because an individual, company, farm, council or body that remains static will be finished and will not be open to what is available to them. This remarkable Bill indicates that we are at a very important juncture in Irish economic life. There is now a fusion of knowledge and scientific endeavour, linked to a dream and a vision of where we can go.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I am very pleased the Tánaiste has come to the House today and stayed throughout the whole debate. Some Ministers disappear after approximately half an hour. It has been a very worthwhile afternoon for the Seanad, the Department, the Tánaiste and the distinguished board who are here this afternoon and are most welcome.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_226">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_637">I thank the Senators who contributed to this very important legislation. Some Members acknowledged the presence in the House of Dr. Harris, Mr. Brian Sweeney and Mr. John Travers, who are very closely associated with the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland. However, as it is a rule of the House not to mention people in the gallery, I did not want to break the rule. I am deeply indebted, as is the country, to these people for what they have sought to do and for the vision Dr. Harris has brought to the task since coming here approximately 18 months ago. It is true we have put together an excellent board from around the world, including people who are prepared to give so much to the interests of this country. Many of these people are Irish but others have no particular interest in Ireland, nor do they work here. However, they care so much about what we are doing that they are prepared to lend their experience and expertise. I think the country will be a great beneficiary from all of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">On the question of funding raised by Senator Quinn, the funding for Science Foundation Ireland for 2003 will be double that for 2002. This is done in the context of spending for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment being reduced by more than 5%. I make the point simply to emphasise that it is a priority. This is the direction in which we are going and we will stay on that course. It would not make sense to have a stop and start approach in this area. As others said, one cannot turn the tap on and off quickly in regard to research. Therefore, it is important to build up our capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">We need to do this at several levels, not just in regard to Science Foundation Ireland but within the universities, third level places of learning, in companies, the public service and in society generally. We need to embrace science in all its aspects because sometimes people do not see the connection between their everyday life and scientific innovation and technological advancement. When moving an old rotary dial phone in my house, which was only about ten years old, my niece asked how old it was and was astonished that we had phones like that as recently as ten years ago. I suppose that brought home to me how quickly the environment changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">We have a long and distinguished list of Irish scientists of the past who were probably never really recognised, and many of whom were women. Women were perhaps more prominent in science in Ireland in the past than they are today and I hope that will be the case in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">Senator Henry mentioned the nanoscience laboratory which was opened in Trinity College approximately two weeks ago, funded by Science Foundation Ireland. What I found extraordinary from that experience was not just the individuals who were absolutely outstanding, but two pieces of equipment, one of which was one of four of its kind and the other one of three of its kind in the world. When we are capable of supporting that kind of investment, we are really at the cutting-edge, and we need to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">We need to spend the money wisely because we have a long way to go to catch up with even the OECD average, which is approximately 2.2%, and we are at approximately 1.2%. The EU has set an expenditure target of 3% of GDP, so we will have to almost treble our current levels to meet the target.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Ireland does not often do well in international tenders for funding, such as the Sixth Framework Programme which was mentioned during the debate. We have put in a huge amount of effort and thought to facilitate the necessary collaboration between Ireland, its EU partners and other countries. We have to ensure that we get more funding in future than we have been able to avail of in the past, when many of our systems were not in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Reference was made to intellectual property and patenting. There have been efforts at EU level in the last two years to agree a Community patent. Such a patent has not yet been agreed, however, because of particular interests such as language and location. If we want the EU to be the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, which is the target set at the Lisbon Summit, something as basic as a Community patent is essential. I hope that great advances in relation to this matter can be made during Ireland's presidency of the European Competitiveness Council early next year. While it is a basic issue on one level, it is vitally important if we want the EU to compete with others in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">Senator Henry and others referred to the decline in the study of physics and chemistry, which is a concern of the Government. It is not just an Irish phenomenon, however, as it has been observed in other countries. A recent Forfás survey indicated that students do not pursue physics and chemistry, not because they find them difficult but because they do not enjoy them. We have to find different ways of educating children in the science subjects. We do not have a national science centre, but it is an ambition of mine to assist such a venture. Many members of the Government share this ambition, but it has not been possible to pursue it because of the state of the public finances. We need to find new ways of making children enthusiastic about science and acquiring scientific knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">With the exception of <i>The Irish Times</i>, the national media do not tend to employ science correspondents. When the Government agreed to the recent increase in the RTE licence fee, it specified that RTE should appoint a science correspondent and I was glad to see the post advertised in the newspapers in recent weeks. If public service broadcasting means anything, it means that such subjects should be highlighted. RTE's increased focus on science should help to heighten awareness of the importance of science and the issues of concern to the scientific community.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I note that this House intends to debate this Bill on Committee Stage next week and perhaps I will take that opportunity to deal with certain detailed observations that have been made today. I did not realise that I would have to respond to the Second Stage debate in this House, even though I have been here on many occasions. It is strange that one's memory can become rusty.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Senator Ryan spoke about Paul Krugman and asked whether companies and countries are competitive. Although I do not run a company, Ireland is a company from my perspective. A country can do many things to make itself competitive. Ireland's competitiveness is not just about low rates of taxation, as tax does not matter if one cannot make a profit. Competitiveness depends on things like skilled and flexible employees, efficient public services, political stability and scientific innovation. I am engaged in close co-operation with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in relation to this area. It was easy to reach agreement about certain matters in a small country like Ireland when there was no money here for science and innovation. Turf wars can break out when money becomes available, however, and people fail to see the big picture.</p>

          <p eId="para_650">The Government is determined to see the big picture. The Taoiseach takes an interest in science and will make some comments in relation to its importance soon. It is important that the Taoiseach, as head of the Government, shows an interest in it, as well as the Ministers who are directly responsible. It is fantastic that the Taoiseach is determined to pursue his interest in science.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I recently met some of the many people who have come to Ireland to avail of SFI funding and to pursue a research career here. They are not all young, although some of them are very young, but they are all dynamic. Some of them are foreign and others are Irish people who have returned here and are delighted to be back. It is fantastic that the opportunity exists for people to develop their skills, particularly those who left Ireland in a previous era when there were no opportunities for serious research. The fact that people from some of the world's leading research institutes are prepared to conduct research in Ireland is even more important than the return of the people I have mentioned. Ireland has gained enormous credibility from the fact that many people believe that it is among the leading countries for these activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Although the amount of money being invested in the technology foresight fund is quite large at €646 million, other companies such as Intel, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard and Siemens spend up to $4 billion dollars on research each year. The Government is investing a great deal of public money, but it must be borne in mind that 72% of the research and development carried out in the world is conducted on behalf of corporations. We should not get too carried away with our investment, even though it represents an important change in the direction of our economic and industrial development. It is as important as the change from agriculture to manufacturing. It is a central part of Ireland's activities in the areas of science and innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">I am glad this Bill has the unanimous support of all Members of the Seanad. It augurs well for what we are trying to do. Although only eight or ten Senators contributed to this debate, we may not have even had that many a number of years ago. An informal group of Members of the Oireachtas, including Senators, who are interested in science has been set up and any Member who is interested in scientific matters should join it. I hope a full Oireachtas committee on science, innovation and technology will be established soon, as interest in these issues builds in the political system. When I met some researchers recently, I encouraged them to get to know their local politicians, as the world of research can often be disconnected from the political system. It would be a good development for politics and for the research community. Similarly, it is important that politicians attempt to get to know what is happening in the research world. The scientific details of that world are beyond the understanding of those without particular scientific expertise, but we can try to understand the significance of science and its role in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">I am grateful to Senators for approving Second Stage of the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill 2002 so speedily and with such warm support. I look forward to returning for Committee Stage next week, if that is what the House decides.</p>

        <heading>Road Safety: Motion.</heading>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_229">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_655">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_656">That Seanad Éireann, encouraged by the drop in road traffic deaths that has apparently resulted from the introduction of penalty points, urges the Minister for Transport to implement without delay all outstanding aspects of the national road safety strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid. Senators will notice that the wording of the motion was designed to encourage a positive debate and I am delighted to see that Government Members did not feel obliged to table an amendment to it. They would have a job thinking up an amendment to something which was actually complimentary to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">In our previous debates on this important subject many Members had occasion to deplore the absence of real progress on road safety. That lack of progress was always attributed to an absence of commitment on the part of the Government to apply fully its strategy, adopted in 1997. Tonight I am delighted to say we are in a much happier position. The improvement can be summed up in the numbers of road deaths in recent months. In November 24 people were killed, compared to 40 in the same month of the previous year. In December 22 were killed compared to 37 the previous year and in January 19 were killed compared to 35 last year. Taking those three months together, 67 people were killed compared to 112 in the corresponding period of the previous year, a reduction of 40% in the number of deaths on our roads. That is not trivial: a drop of 40% is massive. Although we must mourn each of the 67 deaths that did take place, we should at the same time celebrate the 45 lives we would have expected to be added to the total but which have continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Why did this sudden reduction in the number of road deaths take place? There can only be one answer: it results from a radical change in driver attitudes and, more importantly, driver behaviour due to the introduction of the penalty points system in November. That introduction provided the missing fourth element of the national road safety strategy, which is just coming to the end of its five year run. The strategy was based on initiatives under four headings: education, engineering, enforcement and evaluation. Up to the very end, however, there was a gaping hole in one of the four. A table with only three legs will become wobbly: with four legs it is suddenly stable. The leg that was missing in this case, from the very beginning, was enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">I have had an interest in this topic for some time and for the last two years have had the honour of taking the chair at the National Safety Awards on behalf of the National Safety Council. We receive entries from all around the country and examine steps taken by councils, educationists and the media, among others. It has been fascinating to see the changes that have taken and are still taking place in that area. The primary cause of road deaths, however, is our behaviour as road users. Changing our behaviour is the primary element, essential if we are to succeed in doing something about road deaths. In the past the high level of commitment needed was never achieved but we seem to have been approaching it in recent times. Some years ago in a debate like this I made the proposal of a weekend free of deaths. If the whole country was to focus attention on one weekend, we would have quite a success. We made a few efforts to do this but did not really succeed. Then last November, for the first time in years, there was a weekend in which there was not one road death. It shows that with the commitment behind it, things can get done.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The strategy recognised that changes in behaviour required all those elements to be addressed. For nearly the entire length of the strategy – almost five years – the absence of a concerted approach on all elements was shown by the very modest returns in terms of reductions in road deaths and injuries. The strategy had set out what many thought was a very modest target for the reduction of deaths and injuries of only 20%, which would still have left us way above the levels of deaths and injuries of our closest neighbour, the United Kingdom. However, as we approached the very last quarter of the five year period, it was clear that even that modest target would not be achieved as far as road deaths were concerned. We now have the proof of the reason that was so: the lack of a serious approach to enforcement, the fourth crucial element in the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I congratulate the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, on his determination to fill this gap and the energy he showed in overriding the obstructions, the foot-dragging and the inertia that prevented progress up to then. In handing out that phrase, which I do very happily, I want at the same time to avoid laying blame on others for their failure to act. That failure is now in the past. What we should do – I hope tonight's debate will play its part – is build on the success achieved and make sure that in the future we make further progress. To that end, let us look a little more closely at what changed. What happened with the introduction of the penalty points system?</p>
          <p eId="para_663">What changed was the perception of the seriousness with which the Government would address this problem. Up to then there had been much talk but it had not been backed up with action. The combination of those two things – talk and lack of action – added up to a single message – that the Government really did not care. Small wonder then that people did not change their attitudes and behaviour and that the carnage continued, as in previous years, at an unacceptably high level. When it came to road safety, we were trapped in an atmosphere of inertia. We lulled ourselves into accepting a certain level of road deaths as an inevitable part of modern life, something we could not change. We went on thinking this, despite the evidence from other countries that our level of road deaths was higher than it needed to be and that people's behaviour could be changed for the better. One of the most important things that has happened over the last three months is that we have shattered that inertia, at least for the moment. There is still danger – I hear that in other countries the first few months of a new regime work very well, before people slip back into bad habits. We must be careful.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">People have had their eyes opened for the first time to the possibilities of success and change. They have seen the number of deaths drop massively, virtually overnight. That should give us all confidence, citizens and Government alike, in the possibility of not only maintaining that improvement but also building on it in the future. The first thing we should note is that in drawing up a new national road safety strategy we should be much more aggressive in setting targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I suggest a new target of an absolute maximum of 200 deaths per year. I hate to say we will allow 200 deaths but let us make it a maximum. It should be much lower because, if the 40% reduction over the last three months is extended over the whole year, we should already have an annual total of less than 250 deaths compared with the 400 or so that until the introduction of penalty points seemed such an immovable barrier.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Our planning should be based on holding the progress we have made and using it as a platform from which to make further gains. We should also learn the lesson that we cannot make a strategy like this work on a piecemeal basis. Without attention to all four legs of the table, one lacks the synergy the concerted approach demands and delivers. Unless one fires on all four cylinders, one cannot get the engine going.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The Government must continue to deliver on enforcement and be seen to be doing so. It is that which has caused the welcome change in behaviour over the last three months – people's fear of having their licence taken away from them. If that fear is weakened over time, the bad behaviour will slip back to where it was and we will have lost the ground made so efficiently in recent times. There must be no doubt in anybody's mind that those engaged in speeding will be caught and prosecuted with the full rigour of the law. We must make sure that is understood. Similarly, the Government must show its determination to extend the enforcement of the road traffic laws beyond speeding because it is only one of the killer behaviours we must change – the others being drink driving and travelling without seat belts. Tackling these three elements will make a major impact on road deaths. On all of these fronts the Government must show it intends and means business. If it does not convince the public it is serious about this, no progress will be made and what we have achieved will be lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">In these days of retrenchment the Minister will come up against the barrier of scarce resources but, in that context, I draw his and the House's attention to a cost-benefit study carried out in 1999 by Dr. Peter Bacon which proves beyond any doubt that the benefits to the community of investing in a road safety strategy far outweigh the relatively small investment involved. One of the problems we must address is our fragmented approach to costs and benefits which makes it difficult to accommodate spending by one Department that results in savings by another. That is a trivial matter in comparison with the importance of the problem and I hope we can overcome such difficulties in the pursuit of what must surely be clear to everyone as a highly desirable goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">There has been much talk of a traffic corps, particularly in Dublin. I know resources are required but on recent trips to America I have been impressed by the use of older people – people even older than I – who have been brought back into the workforce. Gardaí who retired at 57 years or so could well be brought back into the force, perhaps as part of the traffic corps. The Minister could say that, if resources are a challenge, they could be overcome in other ways than the purely traditional. I welcome the debate and the Minister of State's attention. Even more so, I welcome the success of the last three months in the hope we can build on it in the years ahead.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_230">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_670">I second the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him and his officials on bringing forward the penalty points system at last because it had been mooted for so long. It seemed that only the thought of the loss of one's licence would improve people's behaviour and that has been shown to work within these three months. I can but hope it will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I have the benefit of having seen in today's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner </i>an article by Cormac O'Keeffe on a report to be published soon. The statistics are compiled by the National Safety Council and show the alarming fact that trucks are involved in 20% of fatal crashes. This is the first time I have been able to find that out because it has been difficult to get details about exactly what happened in crashes. I have tried and been unable to get them. Therefore, it is wonderful that we are at last getting some of the figures. One frequently heard on the news that a truck was involved in a crash and now we have statistics from the NSC that show this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The figures show that 494 died on roads in crashes involving trucks between 1996 and 2001 out of a total of 2,622 road fatalities. Of those 494 deaths, 72 were truck drivers, amounting to 15% of the total. This is understandable because one is much more protected driving a truck than in another motor vehicle, on a motorbike or walking. Some 85% of fatalities were other road users. Car users accounted for 51%; pedestrians, 19% – which is very high – motorcyclists, 7%, and cyclists, 6%. Mr. Pat Costello, chief executive of the National Safety Council, points out that it is not saying truck drivers were responsible for these accidents but that they were involved in a high number of fatal crashes which most survived, although 85% of the others involved in the incident were killed.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">What depresses me about the report is that, according to Superintendent Liam Collins of the Dublin metropolitan traffic unit, many truck drivers blatantly break the law. He says trucks have speed limiters that kick in once the truck passes the limit but some drivers have got around this. I expected that, with the new speed restrictions, trucks had improved their level of compliance because they are professional drivers for whom losing a licence would be a disaster. However, that is not the case – they have made little difference in the speeds at which they travel. The article states 80% of articulated lorries exceed the 50 miles per hour limit on motorways and that more than 90% exceed the speed limit in 30 miles per hour zones. That is incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">There are factors which must make truck drivers incensed at the pace of traffic like the huge hold ups in cities, small towns and on roads with road works. The fact that they have to deliver under the just-in-time system operated by many supermarkets and other businesses – where the goods have to be brought to the shelves immediately and must arrive at a particular slot and be in the yard at a particular time – is not a good enough excuse. We also export goods which have to make it to the ferries but the fact that one is rushing to make a ferry does not mean one can put lives at risk. I am glad the Minister of State is here tonight because he will know from his practice that morbidity rates for those involved in crashes involving trucks are appalling. This must be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Motorcyclists, too, fare proportionately badly in their <i>contretemps</i> with trucks with a 7% mortality rate. It is a serious problem that we do not have a test for motorcyclists. It is not only motorcyclists who are in such a vulnerable position, so are pillion passengers. I am a member of the board of Peamount Hospital where we have a unit described as being for the chronically sick young. It would be better termed the unit for the injured-from-motorbike young and their pillion passengers because they have no protection. They are made into mincemeat when they come off their bikes.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The most amazing thing is that we have no test. Someone told me recently that he asked an official who issued licences in a town in Cork how he decided whether one should get a licence. Apparently, there is a block of shops in the town around which the official sends the applicant on his motorbike, and if he comes back on it he gets a licence. I suppose it is his own form of test. Even I know that one is supposed to lean into the corner on a motorbike, but people are leaning in the other direction. It is amazing that so many people manage to stay on their bikes. Measures should be introduced immediately to counter this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">All the cases of Ministers or their families in speeding cars are very disappointing. I was delighted that someone said, "Whatever about the rule of the land, the laws of physics still apply to the Taoiseach and Ministers."  If they are supposed to lead by example, it is shocking that they should be in speeding cars. I saw a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> by a reporter who tried to follow the Taoiseach during the election campaign, but who had to give up when he was doing 85 miles per hour on country roads. I think the reporter was wise.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">It is what the reporter said. Another Minister strongly defended the pace at which the Taoiseach was travelling and spoke of good roads, good drivers and so on. That was very inadvisable, especially coming from a Minister for whom I have great respect. I was astonished because, whether one is a Minister or not, one kills people if one advises one's driver to go faster. I advise the members of the Cabinet to try to lead by example because, as I said, the laws of physics apply to Ministers and their cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">It is probably much easier to have a Garda patrol on the Arklow bypass than on more dangerous roads so as to catch people doing 50 miles per hour when they think the law ordains that they can do 60 miles per hour. One can understand my feelings on that matter. The Garda should try to patrol the most difficult and dangerous parts of the roads, sometimes at least, so it will catch people who are driving seriously in excess of the speed limits. I know one can have an accident on motorways, but as far as I can remember from statistics I have read, motorways are the safest roads. The Garda should concentrate on areas of the roads where accidents occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">An excuse once given to me by some gardaí was that they felt they might cause more accidents by being present with their equipment. I do not know about that; I am sure there is some way in which the matter could be resolved because one really needs to prosecute people when they are at their most dangerous.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesMcDaid" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</from>
          <p eId="para_684">The two Senators who have spoken so far have provided us with some interesting statistics and debate. I am very pleased to address the House on a subject that has an importance and a resonance for all our citizens. Road safety and the need to promote a more precautionary attitude to the use of our roads has finally achieved the level of public and political attention it merits. The advancement of that attention can be attributed in no small measure to the regular and informed debates in which this House has engaged in respect of road safety in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">Those debates have also helped to focus political attention specifically on the pursuit by Government of the road safety strategy, which it launched in 1997. The strategy represented the first venture by any Government into the development and pursuit of an integrated, strategic approach to road safety. This motion allows me to account for our stewardship, and it is appropriate that I should do so now that we have come to the end of the period encompassed by the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The genesis of the road safety strategy of 1998 to 2002 was the realisation that the number of deaths and injuries on our roads had reached a level that was unacceptable in a modern society. However, it would be wrong to suggest, as some commentators speculated, that Ireland ranked as the worst in the European Union in terms of road safety. While such speculation was falsely based, the Government realised that our road safety record was significantly less impressive than that in some of our fellow member states. The purpose of the strategy was to move our record closer to the best in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">In order to achieve that overall goal, it was quickly realised that the countries boasting the most advanced records in Europe all shared a common policy direction. The states in question – Sweden, Holland and the United Kingdom – had all based their policies on the pursuit of a strategic approach. The first page of the strategy stated in succinct terms the underlying context within which the overall strategic approach was to be set. It stated, "The Government cannot acquiesce in this ‘business as usual' scenario."  A failure to pursue the new approach would have resulted in an estimated 550 road deaths in 2002. Against that background, the Government set demanding primary targets to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads by a factor of 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">By 2002, supporting targets of the strategy were as follows: to reduce the incidence of excess speeding by at least 50% from present levels; to increase the wearing rate for front and rear seat belts to at least 85%; to reduce by 25% the number of fatal road accidents, which are commonly drink related, occurring during the hours of darkness; and to implement specific accident reduction measures at more than 400 additional national road locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Excessive speed, failure to wear seat belts, drink driving and poor infrastructure directly contribute to the occurrence and severity of accidents. The high-level group subsequently added a fourth target area, seeking a renewed concentration of policies toward vulnerable road users, and this has been the subject of our more recent advertising campaigns.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">While the strategy recognised the importance of the maintenance and augmentation of existing road safety policies and initiatives, the need for the promulgation of new policies and actions was accepted. This led to the promotion of the following new policies: to extend the use of automatic speed detection systems, including the installation of fixed cameras; to commence evidential breath testing for drink driving; to extend the on-the-spot fine system to non-wearing of seat belts, and to develop a penalty points system.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">While there was early evidence suggesting that the number of serious injuries was falling on a year-on-year basis, the initial reduction in road deaths was not sustained. However, that was to change with dramatic effect in 2002. Last year, some 379 people were killed in road traffic accidents, representing a reduction of 19.7% over the number of deaths in 1997. Thus, the target set in the strategy for 2002 was achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">The picture in respect of serious injury figures is even more encouraging. By the end of 2001, the number of serious injuries reported had reduced by 35% compared with the number in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">It was obvious from an early stage that the realisation of the targets in support of the main primary targets would prove difficult to achieve. This was particularly obvious in the case of the target set for the reduction in excessive speed. A national speed survey carried out by the National Roads Authority in 1999 showed that the speed of vehicles was in excess of the established speed limits on all road classes. This prompted the road safety high-level group to call for a refocusing of the target to concentrate resources on single-carriageway national primary routes, given the higher concentration of risk associated with those roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">A similar study carried out by the NRA in relation to the wearing of seat belts in 1999 showed the extent and depth of the problem. It was found that the rate of wearing of front seat belts was 55%, while the rate in rear seats was 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The results of the NRA examination of speeding prompted the authority to commission a research project by a team of internationally recognised road safety experts from Victoria, Australia. The team's report presents recommendations relating to the deployment of a mixture of speed enforcement measures, with a strong emphasis on mobile speed detection.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">As a follow up to its initial surveys of speeding and the wearing of seat belts, the NRA has completed further research. The reports, to be published shortly, will show evidence of sustainable improvements in relation to compliance with speed limits and the seat belt wearing rates of drivers and front seat passengers. It would seem, however, that there is no evidence of improved wearing rates for rear seat passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The evidence of the NRA research, combined with the results of Garda enforcement and international experience, gave a clear template to the National Safety Council to pursue focused promotional and educational road safety campaigns throughout the period covered by the strategy. Senators will be familiar with the direct and disturbing media campaigns launched by the council over the past number of years. The council realised that there needed to be an element of shock in these campaigns and the graphic nature of the depiction of the consequences of speeding, non-wearing of seat belts and drink driving are aimed at showcasing the real and appalling results of such behaviour. These campaigns have been jointly promoted with the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland to give them an all-Ireland perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The fourth joint media campaign is currently centred on the vulnerability of pedestrians and promotes the need for a more precautionary approach by this vulnerable group of road users. The development of good road safety habits needs to be nurtured at an early stage. The National Safety Council has, therefore, promoted new resource material for both primary and secondary schools. The material forms part of the primary school curriculum.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The national safety test is now into its fourth year and there is widespread acceptance that it has real benefits in terms of better maintained cars which are safer and contribute to better air quality. In 2002, some 536,000 cars underwent full testing and 53% of these passed at the first attempt. Almost 245,000 were re-tested and of all cars tested and retested 90% were issued with their NCT certificates.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">The consultation paper on school bus safety was published and is currently the subject of a public consultation process. The use of daytime running lights is being considered by the EU high-level group with a view to the production of appropriate guidance for all member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">In promoting the road safety strategy, the Government was keenly aware of the need to review existing legislative provisions that impinge on road safety and to deploy new initiatives where appropriate. The headline measure targeted was the possible introduction of a system of penalty points. The strategy recognised that this issue would give rise to the need for extreme care in the development of a suitable system, particularly in the context of the exclusive constitutional role of the courts in the administration of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">While penalty points constitute a key element of the Road Traffic Act 2002, the Act can be seen primarily as a means to enhance the legislative basis for the enforcement of traffic law. It incorporates a comprehensive review of the financial penalties for traffic offences and provides for the introduction of a new system of fixed charges to replace the current on-the-spot fine system. To further support Garda activity, the capacity for the use of cameras and other technological supports was extended to a range of traffic offences in addition to speeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">All public opinion surveys have shown that safety cameras are acceptable if it is made clear that their purpose is to make the roads safer rather than to raise revenue. Camera systems have been operational in the UK since 1989 and, where deployed, have saved lives and reduced accidents. In the UK, the average distance between sites of camera posts is 1.5 km whereas the average distance between fixed-post camera sites in Louth and Meath is 8 km. There are in excess of 3,000 camera sites in the UK, of which approximately 2,000 are used for speed enforcement and 1,000 to monitor traffic light infringements. That demonstrates the belief by the authorities in the UK of the value of these cameras. In contrast, there are only 20 such cameras in Ireland. The 35 mm camera systems employ film cassettes which are capable of capturing 1,000 images and can be processed on a two to three day cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Statistics from the UK show a substantial reduction in excessive speeding and road accidents within a 0.5 km radius of fixed-post cameras. They also show that over the period 1992 to 2000, cameras installed in urban areas reduced pedestrian fatalities by over 50% and road fatalities by 44%. At fixed camera locations in the UK, there was a 44% reduction in speed related accidents, a 21% reduction in all accidents and an 8% reduction in fatal and serious accidents. The average speed came down by 4.7 mph, the number of vehicles exceeding speed limits was reduced by 81% and the numbers of vehicles massively exceeding speed limits – by 15 mph or more – were reduced by 97%. In the UK, safety cameras also played a part in detecting 289 crimes in addition to their key role in reducing road accidents and casualties.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">It was always recognised that the full roll-out of the penalty points system would depend on the completion of a number of information technology developments. While the national driver file is fully operational, work on the remaining IT networks continues. It is premature to fully assess the effects of the launch of penalty points for speeding offences, however, we have clearly seen the beginning of the development of a more precautionary driver approach and a resultant reduction in the number of detections for speed infractions. There has also been a marked reduction in the number of road deaths over the past three months. Provisional data made available by the Garda indicates that the number of road deaths have fallen from a total of 113 in the period November 2001 to January 2002 to 68 over the most recent period. That is dramatic.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Other initiatives taken since the launch of the strategy in the legislative area include the introduction of a requirement to sit a theory test before obtaining a provisional licence. On-the-spot fines were extended to apply to offences such as non-wearing of seat belts, traffic light infringements, defective tyres and box junction violations. The strategy committed the Government to consider a possible change to the legal requirements relating to roadside breath testing. There was no commitment to full random breath testing, but the Road Traffic Act 2002 significantly extends the grounds for the use of roadside testing by the Garda and brings our position into line with that in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The effectiveness of any legislation depends on enforcement which must, therefore, be a central component of any road safety initiative. The Garda has a key role in achieving the goals and targets set out in the strategy. While we can all take credit, I commend the Garda Síochána for its tremendous work and the results achieved over the past five years. As already stated, the number of fatalities has decreased from 472 in 1997 to 397 in 2002 and the Garda must be credited for that. Since the introduction of penalty points, detections for speeding have dropped dramatically which suggests we are making the necessary behavioural changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Garda visibility is of the utmost importance. The facts speak for themselves. The figures for the period November 2002 to January 2003 show a drop in the number of fatalities over the same period in the previous year, from 112 to 68. Credit must go to the Garda Síochána for enforcing the law, thus bringing about this dramatic fall. There has been a sustained increase in the level of enforcement by the Garda Síochána, particularly in the key areas of speeding and seat belt wearing over the period of the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The role of the traffic corps has been discussed and apparently finds favour from all political parties. Visibility is all important. Senator Quinn has suggested that the traffic corps could possibly be started by retired members of the Garda Síochána, regardless of their previous rank. Some would already have the necessary training while others would require training with the new equipment. Gardaí can normally retire after 30 years of service and many retire between the ages of 50 and 52 years. Some might welcome a return to the ranks in the traffic corps. We could also perhaps look at extending the compulsory retirement age of 57 years for members willing to serve. While these are matters for debate, they should be considered in the context of the establishment of the much needed traffic corps.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">While there has been significant progress over the past five years in terms of road safety, those gains should only point us towards further advances. The lessons learned during the past five years will inform us of the pursuit of a second strategy. That strategy will also be supported by the conclusions of both the economic assessment of the measures contained in the previous excellent strategy, undertaken by Dr. Peter Bacon, and a review of the strategy produced by an international road safety expert. The latter report shows that the prioritisation and framework of the strategy still represent a robust model. In pursuing a new strategy the Government will be cognisant of this and seek to add value to the valuable progress made over the past five years. I will also be mindful of what is said in this debate. I look forward to the rest of it and I am pleased to be here to listen to the concerns expressed by Senators.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_711">Unfortunately, I do not share the enthusiastic support for the Government's record on road safety. The road safety campaign failed in its original target of reducing the number of deaths on the roads by 20%. The penalty points system was introduced in the tenth month of the fifth year of the five year strategy, even though it had been promised years earlier. Why was it not introduced earlier and, had it been, how many families would have been saved the bereavement of a loved one in that time? Random breath testing was also promised but has not materialised.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The Minister of State referred to the Australian link. The road safety campaign was based on the Australian model, yet in Australia road deaths were cut by 50%. In view of this we should not be quick to congratulate ourselves. Measures were introduced very slowly and much remains to be done. Last year 379 people were killed on the roads. Families have lost fathers, mothers, elderly parents, grandparents and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">There has been a dubious use of figures in this debate. The Minister of State referred to numerous percentages but we must be careful how we interpret figures. Before Christmas, in a farcical situation, the Minister for Transport had to rescind his claim that most learner drivers were the cause of most fatal road accidents. It subsequently emerged that only 1.6% of fatal road crashes involved learner drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">Speaking as a male under the age of 30 years, I have a good idea of what I mean when I refer to the blatant discrimination by insurance companies against young people. Every day we hear of the involvement of young people in car crashes. It would be much more beneficial if figures showed how many car crashes were caused by them. There is a huge difference between being involved in and causing a crash. The Minister and his officials should take this on board and be aware of using correct statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The Minister of State referred to the shock tactics used in the campaign by the National Road Safety Council. They have not worked and may have gone overboard. The council's efforts have been undermined by the reckless speeding engaged in by Ministers. I admit to speeding, although I should not speed. However, I have never driven at 85 mph. Unlike Senator Dooley, my car is unfortunately not fast enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">During the general election campaign I heard in Kilkenny of the reports of the Taoiseach's break-neck speeding from New Ross. The journalists covering his campaign could not keep up with him.</p>

          <p eId="para_718">I hope that by the time I become Minister the practice of ministerial speeding will have been eliminated. In the past Ministers were driven too fast but it is now time to call a halt. The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy, refused to apologise when his driver was caught speeding. He tried to defend the indefensible. The Government must lead by example to back up the media campaign by the National Road Safety Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Things are not going well in the transport area. A constituent of mine, a lorry driver, had his lorry assessed by a so-called motor vehicle testing inspector who passed the vehicle even when it was not roadworthy. I have heard many similar complaints. Are these so-called car testers subject to regulation?</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_721">Recently, a lady from a haulage firm told me that most of those undergoing tests to drive lorries were from car backgrounds and had no practical experience of driving lorries. Given that many haulage firms are going bankrupt because of the Government's inaction on the issue of insurance, many drivers with practical experience of driving lorries would be more than qualified to examine drivers. The Minister should consider employing their services instead of redeploying people with car driving experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">I accept Senator Henry's remarks on the involvement of lorry drivers in car crashes but the word "involvement" must be looked at. We need to get proper statistics about responsibility in car crashes and it would be useful if the House was notified of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Before Christmas the Minister indicated that he would require drivers holding provisional licences to reapply for their licences. In view of the chaos this caused there is a need to employ extra staff in Ballina. I have met many constituents who are obliged to drive provisional licence holders who are afraid to continue driving. The measure was introduced too precipitously. It should have been phased in over a longer time period. There is a need to take on the legal system in an effort to reduce the cost of insurance and stop young people, especially, from being crippled by insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">In Canada it has been found that many single vehicle crashes are suicides. We must query all statistics. I realise that it is difficult to prove someone has deliberately taken his own life, but this is a factor of which we must be aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The Minister's reference to vehicles massively exceeding speed limits could apply to Government Ministers and I hope he will give my point serious consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Reference has been made to speed cameras. In the previous Dáil my colleague, Deputy Naughten, received an answer to a parliamentary question from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform saying that many speed cameras do not contain film. People soon begin to realise these things. The penalty points system is not working as effectively as it should. The Minister of State made reference to enforcement and visibility of the Garda as the keys to safety. The gardaí are not visible and the law is not being enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I can see for myself that people are beginning to be sloppy again in complying with the law. Friends of mine I have spoken to support this observation. As I was driving to Dublin yesterday a lady crossed a double white line to overtake a car coming towards me and a man overtook me on a traffic calming island. Such things were not happening last December when people were afraid of being caught. Now that they do not see a Garda presence and do not know of people being given penalty points they are beginning to take chances again, as we all do. If the penalty point system is to work we must have proper Garda enforcement. The Minister of State has said this himself. I hope he will consider some of the points I have made.</p>

The introduction of the penalty points system has brought a revolution in the thought processes of all motorists. Surveys carried out since the introduction of penalty points for speeding show a 72% reduction in the numbers exceeding the speed limit. When one considers that almost 350,000 on the spot fines were issued by gardaí for excessive speeding last year, this reduction is hugely significant.</p>

          <p eId="para_737">I do not wish to use the lives of unfortunate people killed on the road as statistics. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that if 378 unfortunate people had been killed on our roads last year instead of 379, we would have achieved our target of 20%. I hate having to quote statistics in that way but as Opposition Senators chose to raise the matter I must point out the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Fear of being caught is a major influence on motorists' behaviour. I propose that the programme of installing speed cameras be extended, particularly into urban areas and housing estates. We all face the problems of cars speeding through housing estates and if something is not done quickly there will be even more fatalities. It would be more beneficial to re-allocate money from some of the traffic calming schemes, particularly at locations where there is already a traffic bottleneck and speeds rarely exceed ten or 15 miles per hour. On my way from Cavan to Dublin I drive through Dunshaughlin, which is a nightmare during the early morning and early evening rush hours. The main cause of the difficulty appears to be a set of pedestrian lights which are not used by pedestrians. The towns of Kells and Virginia have similar problems. Cavan town also suffered until the bypass was built.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The penalty points system cannot be taken in isolation as other Government initiatives have led to safer roads. The Government's five year road safety strategy has seen the number of serious injuries reduced in 2001 to a figure more than 40% lower than prevailed before the launch of the strategy. The low cost accident reduction schemes funded by the Government have been very successful since their introduction some years ago and I am delighted they are being continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">I am delighted to note from the Minister of State's speech that the national car test is now in its fourth year. I have to have my car tested in March. While none of us likes to get the notice and go to the trouble of preparing a car for the test, there is widespread acceptance that it has real benefits in terms of better maintained cars which are safer and contribute to better air quality.</p>

          <p eId="para_743">Senator Quinn's suggestion that retired members of the Garda should form a traffic corps is excellent and I am glad to see the Minister took note of it. In the past few days we have listened to discussions about the Army being used as an aid to the civil power. I would also like to investigate the possibility of establishing a Garda reserve or auxiliary part-time force. This works in other countries and why would it not work here?</p>
          <p eId="para_744">With regard to the Taoiseach speeding and journalists not being able to keep up with his car, I am sorry we are not all as saintly as journalists, who never seem to be caught doing anything wrong. I do not condone speeding but I wonder if journalists ever break the law.</p>

          <p eId="para_746">The signing, lighting and cats' eyes programme announced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will also play a major role in the road safety initiative. I am aware that the Minister is considering the metrication of speed limit signs. I ask him to give consideration to additional warning signs in the Border counties. Drivers from Northern Ireland can become confused when they come into the Republic and do not realise that our signs are metric.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">I warmly congratulate the Independent Senators on bringing forward this motion and I welcome the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">There have been very successful initiatives and I am impressed by the national car test. The penalty points system has had a big impact but I share Senator Browne's concern and I hope the impact is not just short term. We need to watch that.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body is in the process of producing a joint report on penalty points and I will be disappointed if it is not possible to have a cross-Border scheme in effect. Better roads and better road markings make a contribution, while slowed up traffic is a negative effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">I am frustrated by bicyclists who ignore traffic lights and traffic regulations. I saw four examples of this in one day last week. Could the National Safety Council make it absolutely clear that the rules of the road, especially at traffic lights, apply to bicyclists as well as to everybody else?</p>
          <p eId="para_751">I have written to the chairman of the National Safety Council about the danger of sleepiness and drowsiness. This cause of accidents is not properly highlighted. I confess that I once knocked over a bus stop. It was, fortunately, a bus stop and not a tree, otherwise I would probably not be here. In case anyone thinks a scandal has been uncovered, I reported the matter to the Garda the following morning. Why do accidents happen late at night? Drink is not the only cause.</p>

          <p eId="para_754">Yes indeed, and early morning. It is because people are tired. Very often no other vehicle is involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Those who drive heavy vehicles and who cause fatal accidents should be debarred from driving for a long time. There must be a deterrent but if a heavy truck collides with a small vehicle we all know who is likely to be worst affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Road markings are helpful, as are lights on either side of roads in the country that do not have margins. I would like to see more such lights in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I firmly believe office holders, regardless of the Government, should observe the law. If it means cutting down on the number of engagements, so be it.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">I welcome the idea of the traffic corps comprising retired gardaí. So far as the individual is concerned, the best way to be sure one is not involved in a road accident is to travel by train whenever one can.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_257" as="#Leas-Chathaoirleach">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_759">I compliment my colleagues on tabling this motion, which is an extremely good and useful one. That is clear from the fact that there is unanimity in the House and that no amendment has been tabled and there will not be a vote. Everybody agrees with the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">Senator Mansergh referred to cyclists and I agree with him, even though I admit to being a rather bad cyclist. I am of the view that it is highly dangerous for cyclists to cycle without lights and reflective gear, particularly in the country. I was returning from the country one weekend and even in the middle of the day I witnessed a few dangerous incidents. There was a charity cycle and cyclists, two abreast, wobbled around on the dual carriageway.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">I would like to see a campaign to advise people that if walking in the country they should wear reflective clothing and should walk opposing the traffic. Frequently I see pedestrians in dark clothing walking in the same direction as the traffic. That is desperately dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Will the Minister tell the House if commercial vehicles and CIE buses are tested? I do not believe they are tested but if so, how regularly and where is it done? Those I see are in a deplorable state. Yesterday I saw an 89 G registered bus on the quays which was corroded with rust to an appalling extent. It had a big banner on the back saying, "On loan to Bus Éireann". I do not believe that bus was tested during the past ten years. That smoke belches out from the backs of these buses is clear evidence that they have not been serviced. The same applies to lorries and commercial vehicles. I simply do not believe commercial vehicles are subjected properly to the road test.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">With regard to the national car test there are some anomalies, one of which I would like to raise. If one acquires, say, a ten year old car and the previous owner has not had it tested and you as a good citizen have it tested, the certificate covers only the remaining amount of time from the time when it should have been tested. That is idiotic. One could get a certificate that lasts only three months, when it should last two years from the date of the test. The miscreant, who is the previous owner, should suffer any penalty.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">I welcome the reduction in road deaths, as everybody does. I am not begrudging about it and I congratulate the Minister on having introduced the penalty points system. Everybody must welcome the fact that a large number of people are alive today who would not be alive were it not for the introduction of these measures. However, there must be consistency and coherency in road signage and changes in the speed limit. It is absurd to have changes in the speed limits down from 70 mph, to 50, 40 or 30 mph with no real justification and without adequate signage. I instance coming into Dublin in the direction of Kingsbridge, through the Inchicore area, where there are several changes for which there is no real reason. One does not anticipate them because the road stays exactly the same, yet for some unexplained reason there is a change.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">Another interesting instance in Glenageary was given on "Today with Pat Kenny" this morning. A dual carriage has a 30 mph speed limit, even though it is a perfectly good road and should have at least a 40 mph limit. One then goes into an area which is not a dual carriageway and past a special school where the limit goes up to 40 mph. There must be consistency and coherence in speed limits if citizens are expected to observe and respect them.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_767">I accept that and thank the Minister for that very helpful comment, but let us put pressure on them, even if through this debate. Then perhaps the Minister should take the responsibility by means of legislation. If we are to have a national system there will have to be national standards of coherency, otherwise it will be very difficult to have them respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The same applies to road humps, allegedly traffic calming measures. Let us have consistency. Are there any national standards for these things? Some are reasonable but they range from very gradual elliptical curves to simple walls of brick that would shatter the axle of any car, even if you hit one at only ten miles per hour. I would like to see some consistent, coherent national standards here, otherwise people will not continue to respect them.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">When I am speaking about respect, I ask the Minister to look at the position regarding the policing of the three tonne limits. Commercial vehicles, lorries, double decker buses of various kinds routinely drive past notices specifying the three tonne limit. I have a personal gripe here because I live in a city centre address in North Great George's Street where we had at one point a plan to try to stop the rat run of stolen cars, commercial vehicles, buses and so on. That plan was subverted by a rather miserable campaign and the corporation merely put up a notice indicating a three tonne limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">We have written repeatedly to CIE. Last week I stood on the street and personally stopped a bus which was just turning into the street. The driver said he could not reverse it, that he had to go up. I said to him that if he could not reverse, he should get out of the bloody bus and leave it where it was because it was dangerous. I refused to budge and he drove the bus at me. However, I am glad to say two young neighbours, a decent young lad and his girlfriend, said, "That fellow is quite right, we will stand with him," and we forced the bus to withdraw and to go around the proper way.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">How can you have respect for the law when these notices are put up? We have written to CIE, the Garda and the traffic managers but in that instance I blame the city traffic authorities. They have taken a commercial street, O'Connell Street, and said they are anti-car. Mr. Keegan, with charming openness, accountability and transparency, came clean and said, "We don't like cars and if motorists have not woken up to that they are thick."  That is the diplomacy we have come to expect from Dublin Corporation. Because it dislikes cars so much it dislodges them from a commercial street and sends the whole damn lot down the only residential street in the area. That is consistency and coherency of a high order, something the Minister ought to look at and also the lack of democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">They did a survey in that area and asked us all our opinion and we all sent it in. Did we ever get the result of the survey? Did it have the slightest blind bit of effect? One must be joking – not at all. They just wrote back and said, "you can . . well, whatever you want with yourselves".</p>
          <p eId="para_773">I enjoy being on this side of the House. The part of it I inhabit is neutral. Neutrality is so important in Ireland. To demonstrate my neutrality, I listened with some astonishment to Senator Browne who was so passionate about young drivers. It is astonishing to state that they are not responsible for causing accidents and that middle aged and elderly drivers are bashing into them for the hell of it. We should get real about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">I compliment my colleagues on putting down this motion. It has been an excellent debate and I know the Minister will take up the points Members, in their various ways, raised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KateWalsh" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Ms K. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_775">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, for coming to the House to address this important issue. I also thank the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and the officials in the Department of Transport for tackling the important issue of road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The wonderful role played by the Garda must be acknowledged. When the penalty points system for speeding was introduced, critics wondered if the Garda had the resources, manpower or, indeed, the initiative to implement or the commitment to enforce it. The success of the system to date, the decrease in the number of road fatalities and the welcome change in driver behaviour must be attributed to the dedication and commitment of the Garda Síochána. Its future role in administering the system will be paramount.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">I congratulate the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who recently announced improvements in road signage and public lighting and the launch of a new cats' eyes programme on non-national roads. These measures will help to improve road safety to a considerable degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The introduction of the penalty points system had a major impact on the mentality of motorists. In the past, the fear of getting caught and of having a fine imposed failed to act as a deterrent and, unfortunately, accidents occurred. However, the introduction of the penalty points system has helped to change the mindset of motorists. The fear of getting points on one's licence is proving to be a real deterrent and, as a result, motorists are slowing down and lives are being saved. Figures which show there has been a 72% reduction in excessive speeding are evidence that the system is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Penalty points are part of the overall Government strategy to reduce road deaths, which has been in place since 1997. The full implementation of the penalty points system will, however, require a range of resources, particularly in the area of information technology, which are not yet in place.  The points system initiative, as we have seen in the area of speeding, will work well, but it will take time and all the necessary structures will have to be <i>in situ</i>. The Garda Síochána has done a wonderful job, but we cannot expect it to fully implement the system until it is given the necessary resources. These will be in place at the end of the current year.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_783">The Minister is to be complimented for introducing the penalty points system. Without any particular finger-pointing at the Government, why does it take so long to implement measures which prove so effective? The obvious example is the plastic bag levy, which took five years to introduce. I am not being political about this, but we seem to be so slow in terms of achieving an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">In a country which expressed the wish to become the leader in the world of e-commerce – this implied it would put together a sophisticated telecommunications and data transfer network – the job of computerising driving licence records, in order that the points system could operate in the most efficient fashion, is apparently still beyond us. It is being done essentially as a paper exercise, using something close to what people call "snail" mail. I do not blame the Department for this, it is our inability to do things in an orderly and reasonably speedy fashion. We seem to be particularly good at proceeding slowly when building roads, planning, etc. It is time we worked out what is wrong with the systems we employ.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">I compliment the Minister on the points system, but I am uneasy about what will happen in the medium term. For reasons we need not discuss, I have had to do a considerable amount of driving over the past three months. I do not normally drive much at this time of year, but I have had to drive from Cork to Dublin recently. There is no doubt that the penalty points system has acted as a considerable deterrent to ordinary motorists. However, I am beginning to pick up slight signs that that deterrence is beginning to wear off. I have travelled the road from Cork to Dublin and back at least 20 times in the last two and a half months. I have not seen a single Garda speed check on one of the busiest roads in this country which I have travelled on at various times during the week and at weekends.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_787">Yes. Perhaps the speed checks were somewhere else. I have this feeling that there may well have been a response to the volume of paperwork about which gardaí complained would be associated with this. The response may be to carry out fewer checks. I do not know, but I invite the Minister to confirm that gardaí are doing a similar number of speed checks under the new regime as they were carrying out before penalty points were implemented. I am astonished that I have not seen a speed check on one of the busiest roads in Ireland and, I hasten to add, I was behaving much more impeccably than I did heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I have a major concern. A few years ago I looked at the National Road Authority's website for something and came across information on the 1999 survey of various traffic habits, including some of the matters to which the Minister of State referred. I am glad to hear that some improvements have been made in the interim. In 1999, 75% of trucks were found to be in breach of the speed limit. That is a huge number. From my experience as an engineer I am aware that if a vehicle, whether it be a car or a truck, is travelling at 40 mph in a 30 mph zone and is involved in a collision, it is capable of doing 80% more damage. That is not a trivial matter. If a vehicle travels at 60 mph when it should be travelling at 50 mph, it is capable of doing about 45% more damage. These are significant figures. Anybody who imagines that the difference between 30 mph and 40 mph is small is deceiving himself or herself. It is a major difference in terms of the amount of damage that can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">The problem was that 75% of trucks were travelling in excess of the speed limit. That is a huge number and it was up from 40% in the previous survey. All of my, admittedly anecdotal, experience over the last three months driving from Dublin to Cork is that virtually no truck drives within the 50 mph speed limit stipulated in the Rules of the Road, the contents of which every learner driver must know before sitting their theory test. That book states that all trucks are prohibited from exceeding 50 mph anywhere in the country and that is apart from their respecting urban area speed limits. I would be surprised if I came across a truck travelling at 50 mph. Anyone who drives on motorways will agree that trucks are travelling at 70 mph, 20 mph above the limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">How is it that while drivers of small private cars are acutely conscious of the possibility of incurring penalty points, professional truck drivers whose livelihoods depend on it seem to be entirely oblivious to the matter? I do not know what the answer is but perhaps the Minister of State will find out. The statistical evidence from the National Roads Authority is that about 75% of truck drivers exceed the speed limit. The anecdotal evidence, however, gained from much driving on main roads over the past three months is that virtually every truck is in breach of the speed limit with some travelling at 55 or 60 mph. I have been passed on the motorway when travelling at 60 mph by large trucks doing 65 mph. I do not understand why that is. Do truck drivers understand the law – it would astonish me if they did not – or is there some sort of understanding that they will not be prosecuted? I do not see the reason they should be treated differently from anyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">According to the NRA, 3% of all vehicles registered in the State are classified as trucks which are involved in 10% of fatal accidents. Today's report put the figure at 20% but it depends on how one views the figures. Whichever figure one believes, however, it indicates that trucks are disproportionately involved in fatal accidents, which is no surprise if they travel faster than they are supposed to. If we are to achieve the targets set by the Government, drivers of this category of vehicle – even though it represents a proportionately smaller number of vehicles – must observe the law like everyone else because trucks are doing a significant amount of damage.</p>

          <p eId="para_792">I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and their staff for the huge developments that have taken place in road safety in recent months. The achievement is obviously based on work that has taken place over a number of years. The motion tabled by the Independent Senators provides us with the opportunity to discuss what is thankfully a good story. We are all in a position to support it. I was disappointed by Senator Browne's negative approach to what has happened. I am concerned when people expect to see too much progress too quickly.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_794">We could talk about that at length, as Senator Phelan well knows. The penalty points system has only been in operation for a short time, yet the results speak for themselves. I hope people will work with it. In the coming months we can examine some of the enforcement issues that will undoubtedly arise. I travel from Clare to Dublin every week, using the main Limerick to Dublin road, and while I have not incurred a speeding fine recently, I have taken a decision to slow down considerably. I have seen many drivers being pulled on that main road and I am happy with the level of enforcement taking place. There has been a marked decrease in the speed of vehicles, even to the extent that when one is driving at the permitted limit one tends to overtake other vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">Senator Ryan says he has been doing a lot of driving recently. Therefore, he may not have been paying attention to his mail. I understand there are quite a few hidden Garda vehicles in operation and the first one may learn of having committed a speeding offence is when one opens the post to discover a fine notice. Senator Ryan should check the brown envelopes that he has not opened since Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Senator Norris expressed his concerns about the different speeding limits but, as I understand it, they are a matter for each individual council. I am not sure if I would want to see that changed, although some Senators have asked the Minister to adopt a national approach to the matter. I am a strong believer in the principle of local government and do not think central government should usurp the authority of rural areas. County councillors, who have put most of us here, are well capable of making decisions on these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">When the Government's road safety strategy for 1998-2002, entitled The Road to Safety, was published, it outlined a number of policy initiatives to help improve the level of safety on our roads. While the document addressed a number of areas, the main aim was the reduction of road fatalities, in regard to which we have been successful. The target at the time was set at a very demanding 20% – far more than the 15% proposed at EU level. It was also hoped to reduce the number of serious injuries sustained through road accidents by the same margin. A lot of statistics are bandied around about reducing the number of road accidents but accidents will occur wherever human beings are involved in the use of mechanically propelled vehicles. The important thing, however, is to reduce the number of fatalities. I am happy that will occur following the reduction of speed levels. Even at 60 mph accidents will happen as a result of human error but if speeds are kept to lower levels, lives will be saved.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The targets I mentioned were to be achieved through targeting three key areas – speeding, alcohol consumption and seat belts – which are recognised internationally as holding the greatest and most immediate potential for improving road safety. The second progress report on the strategy recommended that vulnerable road users should be added as a further area of focus and that additional measures and resources should be directed at this new target area. It is clear that the Government has made significant progress in achieving these objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">I take issue with Senator Browne on the extent to which we have achieved the target numbers. In 1997, 472 people were killed on our roads. Since the implementation of the Government's road safety strategy we have seen a significant decrease in the number of road fatalities. By 2000 the number had dropped to 415 and by 2002 it had fallen to 379, as Senator Wilson pointed out. Obviously, one death on the road is one too many and represents a personal tragedy. We would all like to have a road system which is completely free of accidents but, given the human error factor, that is not possible. We were short of the target by 0.3%. It is not nice to bandy statistics about and clap ourselves on the back because people are still dying on the roads but we are all in this together. We all have a duty of care to others and ourselves when using the roads. We must show respect for others and work together in trying to come up with solutions involving policies and laws that can be enforced to ensure road deaths do not increase again.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">I am happy, as most are, with the situation that has arisen through the introduction of penalty points and hope we will see no relaxation of the system. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that the Garda Síochána has made a remarkable effort in this regard and have no doubt it will continue to do so. I thank the Minister and his officials and hope they will keep up the good work.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">I congratulate the Independent Senators, particularly Senator Quinn, on tabling this motion. This is one of the few areas of policy where there is cross-party support and a resolve among politicians to change motorists' attitudes. It is important to debate this issue at regular intervals throughout the parliamentary year to review progress and put other suggestions into the melting pot. The Minister of State listened to the many suggestions made tonight. Some will work and others will not. Therefore, we may have to change our strategy on this issue from time to time. I know the Minister will be flexible in his approach to this as the objective is to reduce the carnage on our roads which is a national disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I will not go down North Great George's Street in future. The prospect of bashing into Senator Norris at any time is something I could not contemplate. I will stay away from there and divert as the buses do. I agree with Senator Kate Walsh who rightly highlighted one of the great scandals, the alleged joyriders who are the scourge of some urban housing estates. I also agree with Senator Norris and the point he made about young men and driving. There is something abnormal in the relationship between men and cars. I have a 16 month old baby boy and his first words to me were: "beep, beep."  He has an obsession with cars. There is something in the psyche of men, in particular young men, with regard to cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">I live in a large urban housing estate in Dublin. One of the most dangerous sights is that of young men of 16, 17, 18 and 19 years driving their parents' cars at speed with no understanding of the responsibility that comes with this. Most of the accidents that occur in my area are caused by kids who are out of control on the road, a point eloquently made by Senator Kate Walsh and which I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">I am a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body which, as Senator Mansergh said, is investigating an all-Ireland approach to penalty points. The Dublin-Belfast road is one of the most dangerous. The reason is Northern drivers can speed and do all kinds of manoeuvres knowing they will never be summonsed. Equally, I suspect Southern drivers who use the road regularly have the same appreciation for it. There should be an all-Ireland penalty points system. If one infringes the road traffic law outside Balbriggan, it should be reflected on one's penalty points in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Penalty points were introduced in Northern Ireland in 1996. However, a driver from Armagh driving in Brighton who infringes the law cannot have this reflected in his penalty points in Northern Ireland. There are two separate systems within the United Kingdom, one for England, Scotland and Wales and the other for Northern Ireland. That is crazy and the British should do something about it. In order to reduce the number of deaths on the Dublin-Belfast road we must have a co-ordinated approach to penalty points on an all-Ireland basis. The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body will bring forward proposals to Government on both sides. I hope it will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">I returned recently from a private visit to Australia and was very impressed by their initiatives. They have very aggressive signage on their highways and roads such as "stop, revive and survive". They continually remind motorists they will be caught and penalty points will be put on their licences if they speed on a continuous basis. Their policy seems to work. On public holidays, if one is caught speeding, not wearing a seat belt or whatever, the penalty points are doubled. I was there for Australia Day and there was a huge movement of traffic throughout New South Wales. People abided by the rules because if they were caught, their penalty points were doubled for that holiday period. I ask the Minister and his officials to consider this and see if it could be introduced by way of regulation. Many Members referred to the danger at holiday time. On bank holiday Mondays many people travel around the country and it is something the Minister might consider doing even for one holiday period to see if it would make a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Recently I was summoned to court because it had been alleged by the garda in question that I did not have any tax paid on my car. I went to court and what happened happened. The garda had to come to court for the whole day and consequently lost a day's work when he should have been in the Garda station. We must get away from the notion that gardaí must go hand in hand with us to court.</p>

          <p eId="para_809">It was slightly more complicated than that. The Senator will have to look at the proceedings of the Dublin District Court three weeks ago. The time of gardaí should not be wasted on such issues. They should be on the streets and in stations dealing with law enforcement. Too often we waste their time on traffic infringements. We should introduce a much more streamlined approach through the penalty points system. The efforts made by the Government to date have been good. The Minister should accept the suggestions made in a non-partisan way.</p>

        <speech by="#PatMoylan" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_810">I welcome the Minister of State and compliment Senator Quinn and Independent Senators on tabling this excellent motion. Sometimes when views are expressed from different sides, there may be point-scoring but on this issue Members on all sides have made very good points genuinely and sincerely. I hope they will be taken on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">We must compliment the large number of motorists who obey the law and the Garda on its work. No one likes to be stopped by a garda but if we break the law, we must put up with the consequences. I drive a lot and see gardaí operating speed cameras at many locations. They are doing an excellent job. Senator Quinn made the point that gardaí who may be reaching retirement age or have finished their service and are still quite young should be given the opportunity to do that type of duty. The Minister of State mentioned it, on which I compliment him. It would help to alleviate shortages in the Garda force.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Senator Kate Walsh mentioned joyriders who present a major problem, not only in city areas. The point has been made that they are driving their parents' cars at speed, showing off. This poses great risk to young people and members of the public in general. This issue is being tackled and I compliment members of the Garda Síochána who put their lives in danger – some of them have lost their lives – trying to ensure everyone's safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">I congratulate the Minister, the Government and the officials concerned on the new laws, which I have no doubt have meant savings in accident and emergency units in hospitals, particularly at weekends. As a member of a health board, I have been informed that this is already evident. However, we must continue to publicise the situation in regard to speeding and the penalty points system because in recent weeks, particularly since Christmas, the problem of speeding seems to be re-emerging. For the first few weeks, if one drove at 60 mph one would not be overtaken. However, a number of people are now taking chances by passing lines of traffic. This was not happening up to a few weeks ago. We must continue to highlight the penalty points system because people are more careful.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">As Senator Dooley said, some people who thought they were being smart by speeding in certain areas received a rude awakening when they were notified by post that they had been awarded penalty points. These people will not feel their points adding up. Senator Brian Hayes referred to rush hour and weekends, when a great number of people at times drive fast and in a reckless manner. Perhaps a doubling of the penalty points attaching to certain offences could be considered to ensure people obey the law at weekends, including bank holiday weekends.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">Local authorities have created problems in towns and villages by pursuing ribbon developments. In many cases, there are no proper facilities such as footpaths and, as a result, people must place themselves in danger by walking on the sides of roads outside towns, etc. This has caused problems in many areas. There is a responsibility on local authorities to ensure that warning signs are maintained, cleaned and can be seen. These signs were not erected just for the sake of it, they were erected because there was a real need for them. We must ensure that the onus is on local authorities to enable drivers to drive safely.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">I have already referred to road markings. Thousands of dangerous trees are still adjacent to our roads and every time there is a severe storm an unfortunate motorist is killed by a falling tree. I hope the Department will put pressure on local authorities to ensure that dangerous trees adjacent to roads are made safe, particularly on the southern side of roads where there is a greater risk of the storm knocking them down.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">Previous speakers referred to speeding trucks. This is a problem and anyone who says otherwise is wrong. As I drove from Enfield to Dublin this week, trucks were travelling at 70 mph rather than 50 mph. One can only drive at 70 mph on the motorway but trucks were travelling at that speed on ordinary roads. Senator Ryan commented on the varying damage that can be done by vehicles travelling at different speeds and also referred to the length of time it takes to bring a vehicle to a halt. Given the speed at which some of the trucks to which I refer were travelling, they would have almost reached Lucan before they could have stopped.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">On a wet day it is almost impossible to overtake trucks, even the ones that are being driven slowly, because of the huge amount of spray given off by their wheels. I understand there should be brushes on the covers of the wheels to stop the spray shooting outwards, but that is not the case. We must ensure that something is done about this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">I compliment the Minister of State on many of the new laws and regulations relating to the wearing of seat belts. Many people involved in crashes were saved because they were wearing seat belts. Unfortunately, many back seat passengers do not wear seat belts and the measure relating to them must be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">I hope the Department will allocate extra money for more speed cameras, even if they must be moved at regular intervals. I have no doubt that drivers slow down in areas where cameras are located. However, once they pass that location, they speed up again.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">A previous speaker referred to NCT tests on trucks. Where the test centres are located is the responsibility of local authorities which appoint the testers. I am aware of two centres in my county and I know of truck drivers who were put to great expense to ensure their trucks were roadworthy before they left the centres. Unfortunately, if trucks are not being repaired properly, that is too bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">I again compliment all those concerned on the penalty points system, which is one of the great changes to the law over the past 20 years.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_275">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_825">I want to make a number of points. While I was doing some research during the course of the day, I discovered that, amazingly, there were 37 or 38 road traffic deaths for two months in 1946. In light of the fact that there were few cars on the road at the time, what we have achieved to date is extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">My second point relates to driving tests, an issue at which I ask the Minister of State to look. While I do not blame the people involved, I think the driving test is ridiculous. Every time I drive, what annoys me most is the lack of overtaking skills by Irish drivers. I am referring in particular to people who will remain behind a car that is travelling slowly, allow a queue to build up behind them and never overtake. The driving test should include an overtaking manoeuvre. Anyone who cannot overtake should not be on the road. We should also increase the number of driver testers so that everyone will get an opportunity to take the test quickly. I accept that investment will be required, but the process could be self-financing.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">The other issue I want to raise is the fact that there is no premium or bonus for people who take the trouble to have safety features in their cars. This is another issue which should be taken into consideration. There is no difference between being hit by a bad or unsafe car and being hit by a good or safe car. We need to examine certain issues relating to driving skills and the driving test.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">The measures proposed in Senator Quinn's motion, which I support, need to be enacted. The only other thing that I would like to see in the next year is action being taken in relation to the overtaking manoeuvre. It is ridiculous that one will fail one's driving test if one touches the edge of a footpath during a three point turn. The skills demanded in the driving test should reflect the skills needed in everyday driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">Learner drivers should be able to gain experience in a safe environment before they take the test but we have not yet managed to make provisions in that regard. I do not know where people are supposed to learn how to drive. Donabate Strand can be a treacherous place on a Sunday morning as it seems to be the only place in Dublin where learner drivers can drive in a safe environment. I suggest that race tracks or car parks be officially designated at certain times as suitable spaces for young drivers to learn driving skills before they go on the road.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_276">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_830">I thank Senator O'Toole for sharing his time and Senator Quinn for tabling this motion. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, has attended this important debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">I do not wish to rehash the comments of previous speakers. I am glad agreement about road safety problems has been in evidence among Senators from all sides of the House and compliment the Government on introducing the penalty points system, although it should have been done some years earlier. Fianna Fáil promised to introduce the system during the 1997 general election campaign, meaning that we had to wait for almost six years. The delay was especially unfortunate, as Senator Browne said, because many families could have been spared the loss of a loved one if the system had been introduced earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Senator Wilson spoke about traffic calming. I agree that traffic calming measures have been introduced in certain towns and villages where traffic can be too calm at times. On the other hand, traffic calming measures have been started in parts of County Kilkenny but the funding to complete them is unavailable. I refer to villages like Mullinavat and Knocktopher on the main road between Waterford and Dublin. Kilkenny County Council has not been given the moneys it needs from the National Roads Authority. The speed of traffic through certain villages demands traffic calming measures and more money should be allocated to that end. Engineers should use common sense when deciding whether to locate traffic calming measures in villages. I have problems with the fact that villages on regional roads do not qualify for such measures. There are a number of such villages in County Kilkenny and I am sure they can be found all over the country. When there is a wide regional road leading into a village, people driving at 60 mph may be in the village before they realise it. I suggest that the Department of Transport should extend the scheme to include regional roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The Department is also involved in the low cost safety scheme, which is basically for non-national roads. While it does not include traffic calming measures, it provides funding for local authorities to upgrade non-national roads. I could name umpteen locations in County Kilkenny that deserve support under the scheme but they will not receive it as funding is prioritised according to how many accidents have taken place at a given location. It is not good enough that we have to wait for somebody to be killed at a bend in the road before funds are allocated for that junction under the low cost safety scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The last point I want to make relates to speed limits, a subject mentioned by Senator Norris and other speakers. There does not seem to be any consistency in the manner in which speed limits are determined at different locations. Senator Norris mentioned the problems in south Dublin. I am sure all Senators could refer to similar anomalies. If the Department has issued guidelines to local authorities to help them to determine the speed limits for different areas, such guidelines need to be brought to the attention of engineers. When an elected representative makes a request for a change in the speed limit in a specific area, he or she should be able to have a rough idea of the limit that will be imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I support the comments of most Senators during this good debate. I compliment my colleague, Senator Quinn, on introducing the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_277">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_836">I thank Senators O'Toole and John Paul Phelan for sharing their time with me. I thank Senator Quinn for bringing this motion before the House. I would like to be associated with the general welcome extended to the introduction of the penalty points system which has been a great success so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The Minister for Transport should consider the introduction of a jaywalking law. As one drives around Dublin, one is more conscious of people on the footpath than of the cars on the road, as one is constantly worried that pedestrians will walk out in front of one's car. Small things cause accidents. This is an example of an area that could be improved by a new law.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">I agree with Senator John Paul Phelan's remarks in relation to the low cost safety scheme on national routes. The green and white bollards that have appeared throughout the country have been a great success, especially on dark nights as one turns right on a national primary or secondary road. It is difficult to see the exact location of the junction in such circumstances. The works I have mentioned, particularly the pairs of bollards, have been a great success and should be extended.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Senators have mentioned the subject of courtesy on the roads on previous occasions. The penalty points system has introduced an increased level of courtesy on the part of drivers. When one drives in England, one notices that drivers are much more courteous than their Irish counterparts – they will let one turn onto the road ahead of them or change lanes in front of them. I can see that similar behaviour is becoming more popular here, as drivers slow down and allow more time for journeys. The introduction of the penalty points system has brought about the changes to which I refer. People do not seem to be in as much of a hurry as was once the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Five or six years ago there were about 27 cars per 100 people in this country, compared to an EU average of about 56. Although I have not seen any statistics, I imagine that the Irish rate has increased to about 45 or 50 and that we have moved up the EU league table in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">While the penalty points system has worked to great effect, other measures are necessary. I suggest that we should introduce a speed limit of 50 mph on rural country roads. I do not think a local authority has the right to introduce such a limit throughout its jurisdiction but the law should be amended to allow it to do so in some circumstances. Similarly, the speed limit should be increased in certain places. The 60 mph speed limit on the Mullingar bypass is ridiculous and could be changed to 70 mph.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I welcome the motion moved by Senator Quinn, to whom I apologise for taking up some of his time. I thank the other Senators for sharing time with me.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_843">I thank all the Senators who spoke on this motion tonight. While I wrote down some of their ideas, I will not attempt to comment on them all. Let me touch on some of the ideas that I found interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Senator Kate Walsh spoke about the so-called joyriders and mentioned the work of judges. I agree there is a need for greater consistency in the courts in relation to such offences. Senator O'Toole mentioned that the driving test did not include an overtaking manoeuvre, which I did not know. The Senator also spoke about other issues and I believe it is possible to act on some of them. Senator Browne spoke about random testing. I do not understand the reason it has not been introduced. Perhaps the power of publicans has swayed the Government away from introducing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">I was delighted to hear the suggestion by Senator Hayes based on the fact that in Australia, during peak times when they know there will be problems, they have double penalty points. I had not known of that before – it seems exactly right.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Senator Wilson mentioned traffic calming. That is something that needs to be reconsidered. There is the possibility that in some cases, although there may have been a sensible reason for taking those measures, they have not worked. Senator Phelan mentioned the same thing. Senator Henry talked about the fact that 20% of road deaths are caused by trucks, although trucks comprise only 3% of vehicles on the road. That is a huge anomaly and surely points to one of the causes of our elevated levels of road deaths. I am not sure whether that figure is correct, but Senator Ryan also cited it.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">I was impressed by Senator Mansergh's point about drowsiness. The National Safety Council last year linked up with Lyons Tea for a campaign during which one could stop for a free cup of tea on the road. Senator Paddy Burke talked about courtesy. I once drove a van which had the name of my company on it and I was the most courteous driver imaginable. I let little old ladies by whom I might otherwise have ignored. There is a great new scheme whereby a sticker on the back of a truck directs people to call a number if they want to comment on the driver. Whether they get compliments or criticism, truck drivers, or at least fleet drivers, should take part in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">Senator Burke talked about pedestrians. We have rules for pedestrians but we do not stick to them. In Oslo a couple of years ago I went across the road against a red light after looking up and down to check that nothing was coming. I was almost locked up in jail for crossing an empty road against a red light.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The Minister and I were clearly thinking along the same lines when it came to the suggestion of using retired gardaí in a traffic corps. What a great idea. I hope the Minister will move in that direction. I have a Japanese friend who is a very successful businessman and when I asked him how he succeeded, he gave me a lovely saying: whether you believe you can or you believe you cannot, you are right. He took the example of a football game: if the team members go in thinking they do not have a chance against the other lot, they do not have a chance. However, if they go in believing they can win, then they can. What has happened to this country, this Government and this Minister recently is that for the first time, we have said that we can actually win this battle against road deaths. I congratulate those who have been involved in the successes of the past few months and I urge them not to lose sight, not to lose courage and to continue along that road.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Disabled Person's Grant.</heading>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_852">I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss the operation of the physically disabled person's grant. I refer specifically to the North Tipperary County Council area, which is the area with which I am familiar, and what has happened to the grant in that county in recent times. After being warned as part of our Estimates discussion in December, at the January meeting of the county council we were told that it was finding it necessary to suspend the operation of the grant in the area due to financial constraints, and that as of that date, more than two weeks ago, the council would not be able to process any new applications but would only honour applications which had been fully accepted, with planning permission approved where necessary, health board approval gained and tenders accepted – in other words, only where the work was almost ready to go ahead would the council proceed, and then only because it felt it had no other option under the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">Even in the short period since then a number of people have approached me who want to apply for the scheme, but the scheme has now effectively been suspended. The financial background, as the Minister knows, is that one third of the cost of the scheme is paid by the council and two thirds by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. At the moment, North Tipperary County Council has an outstanding liability, we are told, of more than €800,000 to the scheme, with another €400,000 in approved applications due to be funded if they all go ahead. This means that the council may have to pay out more than €1 million for the scheme, which we are told it does not have. This amounts to a crisis in the funding of the scheme, which has resulted in its being suspended. This is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The grant is not means tested. It was devised to assist a household or individual who needed to make adjustments or additions to a dwelling to accommodate a disabled person, for example, somebody who is confined to a wheelchair, or has an illness resulting in a permanent disability that necessitates the installation of a shower where a bath cannot be used or a downstairs bathroom or bedroom. The scheme has proved extremely popular: we were told, at county council level, that in north Tipperary we have one of the highest numbers of applications for the scheme outside the cities. That suggests that either word of mouth has got around that the scheme is very successful and accessible or the quality of housing, particularly among the elderly, is so bad that it needs a major upgrade.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">One of the reasons people are dependent on this grant is that the housing aid scheme for the elderly has effectively broken down, which means that many older people are using the physically disabled person's grant in order to have, in some cases, quite basic repairs carried out in their homes. They are getting letters telling them there is a four-year waiting list for the housing aid scheme. About two years ago, the Comptroller and Auditor General, in a report on the operation of that scheme, concluded that elderly people are probably dying before their time due to the housing conditions in which they are living and the inability of local authorities – or in this case the health boards – to implement the housing aid scheme to a satisfactory level.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">Perhaps the Minister will clarify this, but I would have thought that the grant had a legal and statutory underpinning. However, it is now not available to those who are entitled to apply for it in our county, where elderly people, families with a disabled child and people who have been in accidents will no longer be able to access the scheme. I am aware of many cases in which work that needs to be carried out cannot be, because people cannot afford to pay for it on their own. Recently, after a struggle lasting over twelve months, an elderly couple with whom I have had many dealings, who live on the side of a mountain without electricity, running water or an indoor bathroom, were able to build a decent bathroom and bedroom because of the physically disabled person's grant. They now have a bit of comfort for the first time in their lives. It was a struggle but we finally secured the grant and it has been useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">It is intolerable, unacceptable and wrong that the scheme is no longer available due to the financial situation in which the council finds itself. I ask that the Department of the Environment and Local Government respond as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_858">I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to speak on funding for the disabled person's grant. The Government is aware of the importance of the grant in helping to meet the accommodation needs of disabled persons but its operation at local level is the responsibility of local authorities and one in which I have no direct function. Authorities operate within a framework laid down in statutory regulations designed, as far as is practicable, to give them an appropriate degree of flexibility in administering the scheme. It is a matter for them to decide the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their areas from within overall capital allocations notified by my Department for house purchases and improvement loans, disabled person's and essential repairs grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">My Department's involvement in the scheme relates primarily to the recoupment to authorities of two thirds of their expenditure on each grant. The balance of one third of the cost is funded from the authorities' own resources from an amount included for that purpose in their annual estimates. Local authority capital receipts, surplus to the requirements of the main local authority housing programme and the remedial works scheme programme, may with my Department's approval be used to meet this balance. While it is open to a local authority to seek a higher allocation in the event of increased demand, an increased capital allocation would not of itself allow increased expenditure by the authority without a corresponding upward revision of its own provision for expenditure on the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Significant improvements have been made to the terms and conditions of the scheme in recent years. The effective maximum grant has doubled from €10,158 in 1997 to the current €20,320 and can cover 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two thirds in 1997. The recoupment rate has increased from 50% to two thirds and a disabled person's new house grant of up to an effective maximum of €12,700 has also been introduced. I am aware these improvements have resulted in a substantial increase in applications from disabled persons. The number of grants being paid increased from 2,857 in 1999 to 4,883 in 2001 while the cost of paying the grant increased from €15.8 million in 1999 to €41.7 million in 2001. Costs are escalating out of all proportion.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">As regards the position in north Tipperary, the county council wrote to my Department last week outlining the financial position on its scheme arising from increased demand and making proposals for changes in its funding. The increased demand for grants in the county is reflected in the increase in the amounts recouped to the council – from €137,000 for 48 disabled person's grants in 1998 to €688,000 for 98 grants in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">The Senator is correct that the number applying for these facilities, which I know are badly needed and I am glad to see being taken up, has massively increased. The scheme is based on the recoupment provisions where the local authority puts up some of the money and I put up two thirds. It is on a <i>quid pro quo</i> basis. I am sure the Senator appreciates that I do not have unlimited funds and it is not as if I have cut back on the scheme – I am providing every bit as much as I did for the last few years. As the scheme is not means tested, anybody who applies – whether they have millions in the bank – are getting State money.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">I note the proposals that have come from the Senator's county council in this regard and I am considering a more targeted approach to the scheme. I certainly have no intention of reducing the resources available because of their importance in terms of the quality of life they can deliver to those who avail of the grant. Some authorities have managed the scheme well while some have not and instead blame me for cutting back. However, when one examines the figures, my predecessor and I have increased the funds on top of the initial allocations to make sure we could meet all demands. I am afraid some authorities have allowed the scheme to go out of control. Without assessment of their own resources or the context of the scheme and how it worked, they have kept approving applications. They have done so knowing there are no matching funds to meet the one third requirement and that they have no leverage to come back to the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">North Tipperary unfortunately finds itself in this position, which is regrettable. I received the information from the Senator's local authority in the last week. However, the allocations I have given in terms of local government funding and non-national roads have been much better than anticipated. I allocated all the resources I could to ensure local authorities would not in any way be cut back on the funding available to them last year. As a consequence, I do not have any extra resources in any kitty to meet the Senator's or other local authorities' legitimate requirements. Nevertheless, we will look at the matter and talk to the officials concerned about it.</p>

        <speech by="#DiarmuidWilson" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Mr. Wilson</from>
          <p eId="para_865">I welcome the Minister, who is having a busy evening. In recent years there has been increased use of the public transport services provided by Bus Éireann and private operators. More people are travelling longer distances to work and commuting daily. During the years private bus operators have provided a valuable service and initiated new routes where CIE was not providing a service. In some cases Bus Éireann subsequently improved services to the areas concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">On the N3 from Dublin, through County Meath, into Cavan and on to Donegal, there are a number of private operators providing excellent services. Since 2000 Bus Éireann has provided a valuable service on the hour from Cavan to Dublin commencing at 6 a.m. Changed working patterns, with people returning to public service jobs and increased job opportunities, have resulted in more and more people travelling long distances to work. In County Cavan people travel from Cavan town and further west to Dublin daily to work – primarily in the public service. They avail of predominantly Bus Éireann services.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">Apart from those commuting daily to Dublin, more people are using bus services because of increased congestion on our roads and traffic and parking problems in Dublin. People travel to Dublin for hospital appointments, social and business reasons. Students also travel to attend third level colleges. The provision of services supplied by private bus operators introduced new competition to the transport area, as a result of which we now have cheaper fares for the Bus Éireann service from Cavan to Dublin. There was room for both private operators and increased Bus Éireann services.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The withdrawal of the 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. Bus Éireann services from Cavan to Dublin is a source of disappointment, frustration and annoyance to many. For those who bought yearly tickets through the public transport tax relief scheme the cessation of the Bus Éireann services poses particular difficulties. While I want to see private bus operators continuing to provide worthwhile services for the people of Cavan, I also want to see an increased level of service from Bus Éireann from Cavan, particularly during the early morning period. By today's standards, Cavan, which is 73 miles from Dublin, is relatively near the city and, instead of reducing services, there is a demand for increased services.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">I want a proper balance to be struck between private bus operators and Bus Éireann services. From speaking to people who have availed of Bus Éireann services over the years, I am aware that the staff based at Cavan station are exceptionally dedicated and diligent and have a great commitment to their company. I know many of these individuals personally and I am aware that they go far beyond the call of duty to assist passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">I referred to the early morning services previously, but the withdrawal of the 7 p.m. service on Sunday, on the busiest evening of the week, is also posing major difficulties to some students and others who travel back to Dublin. We want action and we want it fairly soon.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesMcDaid" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</from>
          <p eId="para_871">I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which is a legal matter. My Department received a complaint in August 2000 from a private operator, Park Transport International, that Bus Éireann was competing, contrary to section 25 of the Road Transport Act 1958, with new licensed services that had been introduced in July 2000. Bus Éireann is exempt from licensing under the Road Transport Act 1932. However, the company is bound under section 25(1) of the Transport Act 1958 to seek the consent of the Minister if it wishes to initiate or alter services to compete with a licensed service.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Following lengthy and detailed consideration of the complaint, my Department concluded that Bus Éireann had initiated passenger road services from Cavan to Dublin on Monday to Friday at 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. and a service from Cavan to Dublin on Sunday at 7 p.m., which competed with the licensed passenger road service under licence No. 00021 given to Park Transport International for services on the Cavan to Dublin route, departing Cavan at 6.30 a.m. between Monday and Friday in respect of the stop at Cavan only. It also competed with the licensed passenger road service under licence No. 00022 given to Park Transport International for services on the Killeshandra to Dublin route, departing Cavan at 7 p.m. on Sunday in respect of the stops at Cavan and Virginia only.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">The Minister for Transport further concluded that Bus Éireann did not seek or obtain ministerial consent to operate the services complained of and that it was, therefore, in breach of section 25 of the 1958 Act. In reaching this decision, he concluded that informing the Minister or Department of plans for additional services in the context of the national development plan or otherwise did not constitute an application for consent under section 25.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">Preliminary notice of the findings of the investigation was forwarded to the company in May 2001. Following receipt and consideration of further documentation from the parties concerned and advice from the Attorney General's office, my Department advised Bus Éireann in January 2002 that it had been found in breach of section 25 of the 1958 Act and that consideration was being given to issuing a direction to it under section 25(3) of the Transport Act 1958 requiring it to cease its aforementioned services. The Department also invited the company's observations.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Following further consideration of the matter, Bus Éireann was advised in November 2002 that it had been found to be in breach of the Transport Act 1958 and was directed to cease the provision of services at the stops in question by 31 December 2002. The company's attention was also drawn to the option of seeking ministerial consent to initiate services in competition with those of a licensed operator.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">It was assumed that giving the company over six weeks in which to withdraw services would provide sufficient notice to enable Bus Éireann to advise the public and make an application for consent to operate the services if it so wished. In the event, the company contested the direction. It appears that it did not provide adequate notice to passengers and the Minister has requested details from Bus Éireann of the notice provided to passengers and local staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">In early January, the company formally requested consent under section 25 of the 1958 Act to operate services from the stops in question. My Department has considered the application for consent from Bus Éireann and sought legal advice from the Attorney General's office before finalising recommendations on this matter. That advice has just been received and the Minister will make a decision as soon as the Department has had an opportunity to consider it.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The Minister is fully aware of the concerns expressed by passengers, Senator Wilson and local representatives to the Department of Transport. Their intentions have been uppermost in mind when trying to resolve this matter. I will advise the Minister of the matters raised here this evening and they will be taken into account as far as possible when making a final decision on the matter. This matter must be dealt with strictly in accordance with the relevant provisions of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 February 2003.</p>
