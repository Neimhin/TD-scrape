          <p eId="para_18">I would have thought that who appears in this House is relevant. When will the Leader provide time to allow the Tánaiste to come into the House to outline the view of the Government on this matter? We got into difficulty on the Nice treaty because people's views were overlooked. People felt an elite group was in control and it is the case that the Government appears to be doing something which is completely at variance with two standing committees of the House, and that is worthy of debate. I know the Leader accepts that and I ask that the Tánaiste would come here and that the House would debate the matter. The European Parliament will debate this issue next week. Every other parliament in the European Union has debated it. This House and the other House should debate the matter urgently in plenary session so the Government, in whatever position it takes, will reflect the views of the people on 27 November.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">I hope when we address this issue, we will also look at the issue of the treatments which may emerge from embryonic stem cell research because while good progress is being made in adult stem cell research, there are degenerative diseases, about which listeners to the show this morning will have heard, that cause great grief to people. We want to be honest and say we will not allow these treatments if we advise the Tánaiste to vote in a way other than that which she appears to be considering.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">We also need to address the issue of pharmaceutical companies undertaking this research, which should be under the control of parliaments and not left, as it is in the United States, to bio-banks of great financial worth. Some people do not understand that there are those who are trying to take control of this issue rather than let it develop on its own. We should also address the issue of pharmaceutical companies and whether they should be allowed to work here if they have associations with embryonic stem cell research elsewhere. How do we know that some of the technology they are developing elsewhere will not be applied here?</p>
          <p eId="para_30">We need to look at this issue in a broad way. The Tánaiste's views on the topic need to be addressed. We also need to address whether we will allow these treatments to be used if they are found to be successful and to consider our attitude to pharmaceutical companies here which may be using these techniques in other countries. Should they be banned from having factories here?</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_31">There is a fundamental point here, that is, that the Tánaiste chose to debate this issue outside the Houses of the Oireachtas before she debated it in them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_25">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_26">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_33">That is profoundly wrong, and I would say that regardless of who was the Tánaiste and who was in Government. A process has developed over the last 20 years where the last place members of Governments choose to make serious announcements is in the Houses of the Oireachtas. There is a fundamental issue here about where governance and accountability lie. I do not want to get into the debate on the merits or demerits of this issue; I have tried to avoid doing that. The real issue here is that ethical matters should not be determined by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and that such matters are not ones which should be determined by the Government without reference to the Oireachtas. One could go on forever about the arguments for the merits or demerits of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I know the professor of bio-chemistry in Dublin City University who believes embryonic stem cell research is a diversion and that most of the probably more productive research could be done in different ways. I cannot argue with him. The argument as to whether we would use treatments which come out of this research is a diversion as well. We regularly use things that are the product of weapons research, which I detest. We probably use things that are a consequence of chemical warfare research because things are discovered as a result of it. That does not justify an immoral action, nor does it necessitate one. We must live with our own ethical—</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_28">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_36">It is a speech and I will justify my right to make one. This is a fundamental issue whether Senator Callanan understands it or not. It is about ethics and what we understand to be right and wrong. I do not have a monopoly on this issue but the Houses of Oireachtas is the place where these matters should be decided and not on the basis of advice from civil servants to the Tánaiste to be broadcast on the airwaves without reference to the Oireachtas. That is the point I wanted to make, and I will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I would like to know what advice the Government really got on Aer Rianta. Is there a logical reason behind the decisions taken? Was a decision taken after which advice was sought that turned out to be the opposite of what the decision-maker wanted? We have ended up with a situation where it appears that not only is the future viability of Cork and Shannon airports threatened, but possibly that of the other regional airports as well. The Oireachtas should know what is going on here – it is simply a <i> fiat</i> at the end. Taxpayers' money was used to fund studies into the future viability of Cork and Shannon Airports and other airports. We are now being told that even though taxpayers' money was used, we will not know what conclusions were drawn. That is wrong and it is the duty of the Leader to bring the Minister for Transport, however reluctant he may be, to the House to outline precisely what his advice was and how he came to the conclusions he reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">I do not know whether anybody else saw a report on RTE last night on that awful tragedy in Iraq. RTE's European correspondent reported on attitudes in Italy, talked about the Italian Government being determined to keep the troops there and then proceeded to talk about Italian mammas wanting to bring their boys home. That was a profoundly offensive remark.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">It is wrong to say the matter of stem cell research was not debated in the Oireachtas. I am a member of the Sub-committee on European Scrutiny of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs which looked at this issue and received comprehensive documents on it. This issue was referred by the sub-committee to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment. If I recall correctly, the Tánaiste said this morning that she was prepared to attend the committee to discuss this issue. On several occasions, she emphasised the complexity of the matter. She was reluctant to form any judgments in advance of a national debate and said she was awaiting a report from Professor Dervilla Donnelly's expert committee on it. The matter has been discussed. It is, of course, appropriate for the House to discuss it as well – I would not deny that. I am sure that can be arranged in due course.</p>

Members should be commended for insisting that this issue be debated in an open fashion and I hope the Tánaiste will be available at an early date to do so. I have asked previously about the status of the Hanly report, and I do so again. It is important that we, in Nenagh and in the mid-west, know what is happening. I suggest to the Minister for Defence a few political commandments such as "thou shalt not hang thy colleague out to dry" and "thou shalt not speak with a forked tongue."</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I join with previous speakers in calling for a debate on stem cell research. I know we do not want to have a debate on the Order of Business, but some of the comments made here this morning are a little unbecoming given the seriousness of the issue. I, for one, have called for this debate on a number or occasions over the last few weeks. I am not aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has refused to come before this House, but I am aware the Leader is trying to arrange a debate with the Tánaiste. Some of the remarks passed this morning were not justified. Without getting into the ethical issues, the reality is that there is an embargo on stem cell research until the end of this year. If a decision is not made at the end of this month there will be a free-for-all in the private sector to undertake embryo research with effect from next January. What people are trying to do here is to ensure any form of research is carried out under public control. That is the issue we are now facing, not the ethical issues which we can raise when we debate the matter in this House. The sooner we have this debate and clear up this matter the better.</p>

However, I am bemused by the recent stealth tax announced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, as in a rural area, for a 2,000 square foot house, there will be a stealth tax of €13,000. How is that going to ease the pressures of planning?

The levies are a matter for local authority members. Levies are already being applied and there are now proposals for managers. If we favour reform and the empowerment of local councillors we must allow them to make decisions such as these.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on planning, particularly with regard to single houses in rural areas. I understand that draft guidelines are in the early stages of preparation in the Department and will be sent to local authorities. This is an important issue which should be debated in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">I support Senator Leyden's call for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to debate the prisons issue. The Minister should be commended for tackling a matter which should have been tackled years ago. The amount of funding being diverted from the prisons' capital programme is unsustainable. Those of us who visited Mountjoy Prison recently would advocate that the capital programme be put in place to provide humane conditions for prisoners and not diverted to prison officers' overtime, as has happened in the past.</p>

I understood these are paid for out of taxation. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government appears to have no idea of reality. He talks about ring-fencing development levies, but we all know they will disappear into a black hole to be used to fund other shortfalls in local government.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">"(<i>e</i>) new television or radio programmes to foster understanding of the global dimensions of Irish society.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">When I spoke on Committee Stage I referred to the importance of this amendment. Sometimes we are inclined to forget the international dimension. I think of the contribution of Concern and other such organisations and, under the umbrella body of Dóchas, there are about 33 organisations. I felt there was a chance to recognise this in broadcasting policy by including this theme and the issue of globalisation. I do not see any considerable cost arising from this. However, it would be recognition of the tremendous work such organisations do and the globalisation concept. That is why I tabled the amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_154">I second the amendment which is also in my name and reiterate Senator Finucane's comments. While the Bill deals with the necessity to protect Irish cultural heritage, an issue about which we spoke at length on Committee Stage, it is important we include another dimension which could be useful to it. We often pay lip service to Ireland's role in the global community. In reality, Irish culture has had a defining role in a global context and, in particular, in an American and European context. The influence of Irish cultural heritage throughout Europe goes back many centuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">It is important, in this modern era, that new television and radio programmes foster understanding of the global dimensions of Irish society. We are concerned that the Bill as currently drafted creates the notion of Irishness as a static one. The Bill is not sufficiently flexible and is not complete without such recognition. We will have to come back at a later stage to amend it to include such recognition. We may also find ourselves in the position where lack of recognition undermines the potential of the fund and the spirit of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I do not think the Minister is averse to that notion. He has been generous in taking on board other points and I commend him for doing so. I ask that he consider taking on board this minor but extremely relevant amendment. While we should recognise and promote Irish uniqueness in the international context we can use this legislation – this is important – to acknowledge and promote an understanding of the impact European and international cultural aspects have on Irish citizens at home and abroad. In that sense, the amendment creates a reflective context of how the wider world shapes what it means to be Irish and does not simply remain static.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The amendment could potentially offer the possibility of delivering to an audience a range of new stories and new types of investigations about, for instance, the experience, rights, responsibilities, successes and challenges faced by Irish citizens in the global community. It could allow us to explore the dynamic and progressive changes currently taking place in Ireland. When travelling on a bus last night, I heard people speaking in a wide range of languages. I did not hear anyone speak in English. Dublin has become a metropolitan area and Ireland has turned into a multi-cultural society. It is important this is recognised in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">It is also important we examine those changes in the context of how we situate ourselves in Europe and beyond. That would allow us to explore the nurturing of expertise, talent, culture, heritage, language skills and overseas development and our contribution in that regard. It would allow us to examine how we have been enriched by our experiences and how, through that process, we have become more diverse and multi-cultural.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">The changes reflected by a small incident are important particularly in the context of our current existence. There has been massive change in Ireland. Our relationship with the wider world is changing and that should be reflected in our legislation and in how we interpret our culture. We should look not parochially, but globally at this issue and should examine wider perspectives. We should also consider our interconnection in the wider world and in a much more global society in a media context in particular.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">This is an interesting amendment and is one which has been facilitated by the Minister taking a proportion of the licensing fees and making it available to assist the independent broadcasting area as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">I would like to concentrate on a variation of the amendment. Only certain parts of Northern Ireland receive the RTE1 and RTE2 signal. It behoves us to ensure Northern Ireland as a whole receives that signal. Some 95% of this fund will go to RTE and I ask that the Minister use his influence to ensure this important issue is addressed. RTE has, in fairness, produced some good programmes recently. I saw a programme the other evening about the death of John Condon from Waterford, the youngest soldier, at 14 years of age, to be killed in the First World War. Such programmes broaden our scope of thinking and are conducive to the type of climate we are trying to create in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">I know it is not intended that TV3 will receive money from the fund. That channel is doing a good job. Likewise, anything that would assist it to extend its signal across Northern Ireland would also be welcomed. I am able to receive the BBC, Northern Ireland and UTV signals in the heartland of republican Wexford. These channels help to expand our thinking and comprehension of different cultures on this island. We should ensure people in Northern Ireland can receive signals for all channels as is the case here. Television is a powerful medium which can assist dramatically in creating a better understanding between our various traditions which, in turn, will be of great assistance to the reconciliation process and to creating a common identity rather than concentrating on the issues that divide us, which are far fewer.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">I thank Senators for their comments. I will preface my remarks by saying that I am not against the spirit of what Senators are trying to achieve. I genuinely feel that the context in which Senators are trying to amend the legislation is already taken into account in section 2 which sufficiently reflects Irish cultural heritage and experience. Section 2(1)(<i>a</i>)(vii) deals with the Irish experience in a European and international context.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">I reiterate the point I made in this regard on Committee Stage. The issues raised by Senator Jim Walsh are dealt with in the context of RTE's commitment to its public service broadcasting, particularly in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and other agreements which set out the view that there be a transfer of broadcasting, North and South. RTE already has that onus upon it. Equally, TV3 has some commitments in this respect, but it is a purely commercial organisation, and the onus is different. The issue of Irish culture in the international experience is well catered for in the Bill. I was taken with what Senator Ó Murchú said about the Chinese people with whom he mixed in Ireland, who thought that we should not constantly insist on other cultures in this society but should instead endeavour to retain our own culture. The genesis of this Bill was a desire to place slightly greater emphasis on issues to do with Irish culture, North, South, internationally and in the European context. This is adequately catered for in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">I acknowledge what the Minister is saying. I examined this in the context of the amendment, considering what he said about "the Irish experience in European and international contexts". It would be easy to add to that "to foster understanding of the global dimensions of Irish society". It would be no big deal to do so, as the Minister is expressing that with his references to "European and international". The necessity is probably to recognise the globalisation of the media. If we focused on that aspect, it would cover matters within that scheme. There is no wide variation from section 2(1)(<i>a</i>)(vii), which would accommodate an amendment. This has been put forward by 33 representative organisations under the umbrella of Dóchas. Acceptance of the amendment would at least give recognition to the type of work they have carried out on the international stage. I ask the Minister to consider extending the wording slightly to cover that.</p>

I have no doubt that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will publish the scheme, as that is fundamental to making it open to business and inviting applications. I also have no doubt that, in keeping with that well-established practice, the Commission will publish each scheme on its website.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Notwithstanding this, I agree that a specific provision should be included in the legislation requiring that each scheme be published, including by electronic means.

The Bill specifically places responsibility for the preparation and implementation of the scheme on the BCI itself. For the sake of clarity, I should say that the amendment I propose would apply to all schemes.

          <p eId="para_183">Once again, the amendment follows an undertaking I gave on Committee Stage and is in keeping with the spirit of the amendment tabled by Senators Quinn and Henry. This section and the amendments relate to the review of the operational effectiveness and impact of the scheme by the BCI every three years or at such other times as I may request and a report to me thereon. The amendment provides that I publish the review, including by electronic means, and lay it before each House of the Oireachtas. The point was well made by Senator Quinn on Committee Stage that if the scheme itself is to be laid before the House, a report on a statutory review should similarly be made available. I also propose some minor textual amendments to the section, including one that makes it clear that a written report is required from the BCI.</p>

If anything, in the context of what we have been discussing recently, namely, Senate reform, and what is evolving in the Senate itself, it gives more recognition and status to the Senate that that is now happening regularly. We had a very interesting discussion on Committee Stage, and I recognise that the Minister has taken some of the amendments on board. I also recognise the validity of his comments that he would leave to the discretion of the BCI the types of proposals that come before it regarding funding. The verbal reassurance he gave that programmes from community radio and television would be considered by the BCI along with other proposals means that they will, one hopes, receive similar consideration.</p>

I received a copy of the Bill in the week when the Oireachtas was said to be on holidays. I was sick in bed at the time, so I had the benefit of reading the Bill and listening to radio programmes at the same time. Some people on the radio were complaining at great length about politicians. I started to wonder if we should not keep some of the funds provided for in this Bill for ourselves, so that we could run our own radio station. It was the only system I could think of that would give us a right to reply. We have not decided to give funds to politicians in this Bill, but I suppose there is nothing to prevent us from starting our own station and looking to the BCI for funds.</p>

I would support the establishment of a television channel to continually broadcast the proceedings of the Oireachtas in order that people could see this type of debate. Most of the work done in the Oireachtas relates to the day-to-day formation of legislation, involving genuine debate on amendments, which may be accepted by the Minister. It would probably not be appropriate to establish such a channel under this fund. I assumed at one stage that RTE would take this idea on board and I hope we will see it in the future. I look forward to the debate next year on the broadcasting authority Bill, which will be a significant addition to the legislative framework. I would like to discuss an issue that I appreciate may be slightly out of order, but I am sure the Acting Chairman will allow me to do so because he is out of order from time to time.</p>

When I initially learned that areas like the marine, natural resources and communications were to be included in the Minister's remit, I felt that he was being burdened with such a wide range of matters that it would very difficult, if not impossible, for him to grasp his portfolio. His handling of this Bill clearly demonstrates that he has grasped this aspect. I congratulate him on being able to do so and his officials for putting this together. I appreciate that the Minister introduced this Bill in the Seanad, listened to Senators and accepted amendments. I was not here a few moments ago, unfortunately, to hear his views on amendment No. 1, but I gather that he said that he would consider the matter before the Bill is taken in the other House.

        <heading>United Nations Mission in Liberia: Statements.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_198">I thank the Seanad for the opportunity to outline the background to the United Nations mission in Liberia, UNMIL, and the reason the Government decided to respond positively to the invitation from the United Nations to provide a contingent.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Ireland has accorded central importance to the United Nations since it became a member in 1955. Within the UN system, Ireland has always supported effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights. It has also been a strong defender of the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security. In line with this approach, Ireland has taken seriously its obligation under the Charter of the United Nations to make available to the Security Council armed forces, assistance and facilities to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Ireland's Defence Forces and, in more recent times, the Garda Síochána, have gained extensive experience in peacekeeping and have been regularly approached as a source of peacekeeping personnel. Relative to our size, available resources and capabilities, both financial and military, Ireland is proportionately a very large peacekeeping contributor within the international community. As a result, there is extensive experience of overseas peacekeeping in a wide range of missions among the serving personnel in the Defence Forces. Nearly 75% of all eligible serving personnel in the Army have served overseas, while, within the officer and NCO groups, that figure rises to 90%.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Today, the call for Ireland's assistance comes from Liberia, a troubled and poverty stricken country that has suffered under a brutal regime. Liberia is ranked 174 out of 175 nations on the UN world human development index, which measures health and living conditions. It is a deprived, war-torn and war-weary nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Liberia has been in a state of near-constant conflict since the late 1980s. Along with its neighbouring countries of the Mano River Union, comprising Sierra Leone and Guinea, it has been at the centre of inter-related conflicts driven principally by the sponsorship of rebel movements by national leaders seeking to undermine their neighbouring regimes. Liberia's former president, Charles Taylor, was the principal architect in fomenting instability in the region, particularly through his support for the rebel movement in Sierra Leone, the Revolutionary United Front. In turn, Sierra Leone and Côte d'Ivoire have been accused of supporting and sponsoring anti-Taylor rebels in Liberia.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">The conflict in the region has been marked by large-scale human rights abuses, including, intimidation, rape, decapitation and murder. Within Liberia, two major rebel groups emerged in opposition to the regime of former president Charles Taylor. Both groups, Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia, have histories of atrocities towards civilian populations and have relied on child soldiers, including girls. It is estimated that Liberia has some 27,000 to 38,000 combatants, including the Taylorites, up to 70% of whom are minors.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">With the assistance of the United Nations and the Economic Community of West African States, there has been significant progress in moving towards peace in Liberia since July this year. Peacekeeping troops have been deployed in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. President Taylor has gone into exile in Nigeria. In addition, a National Transitional Government of Liberia has been established involving representatives of the Government and rebel parties, in accordance with the comprehensive peace agreement signed by the Government and the rebel groups in Accra on 18 August 2003. The peace agreement, which sets out a road map towards elections in 2005, has been endorsed by the Security Council in Resolution 1509, which also established UNMIL.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">While there has been progress, Liberia remains highly unstable and the peace process remains fragile. The rebel movements continue to control large areas outside the capital of Monrovia. Minor incidents can quickly escalate and there is poor control and communication between the disparate elements of the rebel groups. As Deputies will be aware, there have been some incidents involving the rebel groups and Government forces in Monrovia itself and, more recently, in the north of the country since the National Transitional Government of Liberia was established.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Establishing peace in Liberia, in tandem with the current UN operations in support of peace in Sierra Leone and the wider Mano River Union region, offers a real and tangible opportunity for the international community to assist in bringing stability to the region as a whole. The Defence Forces have a strong tradition of participation in missions of this nature and Ireland has a particular commitment to Africa, which is evidenced by, among other things, our bilateral aid programme. The Government considers that Ireland, as a long-standing contributor to UN peacekeeping, should participate where possible in suitable peace support operations. The UNMIL operation in Liberia offers a suitable opportunity for such participation.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The mission in Liberia has a strong and robust UN mandate. It will operate under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, which means that the force is authorised to take all necessary measures to fulfil its mandate. The mandate is comprehensive and includes monitoring the implementation of the cease-fire and the comprehensive peace agreement between the Government and rebel forces. It also includes, <i>inter alia</i>, assisting the disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration and repatriation of all armed parties, providing security, protection and humanitarian assistance, and promoting human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The proposed Irish contingent will comprise a motorised infantry battalion of some 430 personnel and a small number of additional personnel who will be deployed at force headquarters and as military observers. At the request of the UN, a contingent of the Army ranger wing, amounting to some 40 personnel, will be deployed for a three month period.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The Irish contingent will operate as the force commander's rapid reaction force. It will provide an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force to provide a swift and decisive military reaction to any crisis. In the initial stages, the Irish battalion will act in a path-finding role for the UN brigades deployed beyond Monrovia.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Deployment to UNMIL will take place during November and December 2003. Initial deployment will be for one year, with a possible extension thereafter, subject to renewal of the UN mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission. In the case of UNMIL, my intention is that the duration of Defence Forces involvement will not exceed two to three years. Elections, which are due in 2005 under the comprehensive peace agreement, should be completed by the time the Irish contingent withdraws.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">A full assessment of UNMIL was undertaken, including a comprehensive and detailed reconnaissance by an experienced Defence Forces team, before a final decision was made on their deployment. The military authorities have reported that Liberia is an inherently dangerous theatre of operations. The potential for renewed hostilities, an unquantified mine or improvised explosive device threat, hazardous driving conditions, the demanding climatic conditions and the threat to health make force protection a primary concern for the Defence Forces. However, I am assured by the military authorities that, while circumstances are difficult and volatile, they are satisfied they can discharge their mandate in an effective manner and maintain the safety of their personnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The decision to send troops overseas is not taken lightly. I assure the House that our ability to protect the health and safety of our personnel is of paramount concern when considering any mission. Once a decision to deploy is made and the nature and manner of that deployment are determined, all operational decisions regarding the deployment, force protection assets, medical facilities, etc., are a matter for the military authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The final decision on deployment to Liberia was not taken until the detailed reconnaissance had been undertaken by the Defence Forces and I had received the report from the Chief of Staff. While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions, it is policy and practice to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately trained and equipped to carry out their mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The Defence Forces are deploying significant force protection assets and medical support on this mission. The equipment being deployed is of the highest quality. The Mowag armoured personnel carriers being deployed on this mission were also deployed with the Defence Forces when they served with UNMEE in Eritrea where they performed effectively. We are also deploying armoured vehicles and support weapons, heavy machine guns and a mortar platoon to provide protection and a significant response capability to the contingent.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">A key concern on this mission is the health of our troops, having regard to the endemic nature of disease in Liberia. The Defence Forces adopt a comprehensive approach to managing and protecting the health of deployed personnel. As a matter of course, all personnel volunteering must have passed their annual medical in the first instance. They are then subjected to a further detailed overseas medical, where they are assessed for suitability with particular reference to the physical requirements of the mission in question. The troops to be deployed to Liberia will all go through this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The main risk to health in Liberia is malaria. The director of the Army Medical Corps has stated that systematic use by Defence Forces personnel of anti-malaria medication should be effective in protecting them from this disease. Troops are being fully immunised against all other known disease risks, including yellow fever, hepatitis A and B, cholera, meningitis and tetanus. The director of the Medical Corps has also had detailed consultations with the Royal College of Surgeons regarding the tropical disease aspects of the mission. In addition, special training is being provided by the Netherlands to our medical personnel on the environmental health issues arising in a tropical setting. As regards possible water-borne parasites or diseases, the Defence Forces are bringing their own water purification and sewage treatment plants with them. On return from a mission, all troops are fully tested from a health perspective as a matter of course.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The Defence Forces will be deploying as part of the battalion, a state-of-the-art containerised medical facility, which was recently acquired. The medical facility will be operated by two medical doctors who will be assisted by a team of 13 Defence Forces medical personnel and paramedics. A full surgical medical facility is being provided to the mission by the Netherlands initially and Jordan thereafter. In addition, there is a Red Cross medical facility in Monrovia and a full surgical medical facility in Freetown, which is attached to UNAMSIL and also provided by Jordan. The Jordanians provided a similar facility to our troops in UNMEE, which worked well.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">I assure the House that the required facilities and medical personnel, including medical doctors, to provide for the Defence Forces contingent in Liberia will be deployed and maintained on an ongoing basis. I am assured that all these facilities fully meet the requirements for this mission. At the recent RACO conference, its president indicated satisfaction with what is being proposed with regard to force protection, particularly the health and medical aspects of the mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Ireland has long recognised its obligations to support peace and security throughout the world. There have been suggestions in the media and elsewhere that Ireland should only embark upon a mission where there is absolute certainty with regard to safety and no threat to our personnel. I cannot accept this position. Sometimes our obligations mean operating under difficult circumstances in dangerous situations. Sometimes we cannot wait for peace to happen, we need to help establish and maintain it. Ireland will not falter in its obligations in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">In Liberia, Ireland has the opportunity to contribute, in a substantive manner, to bringing stability to a key region in Africa and to support the establishment of peace, respect for human rights and the rule of law as well as the re-establishment of civil society in the region. We have the opportunity to facilitate and support the development of the country and the aspirations and potential of its people. Since our first involvement in peacekeeping in 1958, Ireland's willingness to participate in UN peace support missions has been motivated by a firm belief that peoples throughout the world have the right to live in peace with justice, free from fear. Our participation in UNMIL represents a continuation and vindication of that belief.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">I commend the individual members of the Permanent Defence Forces who have served and continue to serve on overseas missions, together with their families and loved ones. As we enter the Christmas season, it will be a difficult time for families with loved ones far from home. I hope, however, the arrangements we are putting in place, the provision of telephone services, Internet access and a direct mail service, will help ensure there is good and effective ongoing contact between our peacekeepers and their families. I assure the personnel being deployed and their families that we will do whatever we can to protect our personnel and return them safely to their families.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_222">I welcome the Minister to the House. He will be glad to note that on the Order of Business, Senators called for him to come before the House today on a separate matter. I am happy he is in the House to discuss this important issue and allow Senators to contribute to the debate. On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I express warm support for the Government's decision to deploy more than 430 of our troops to Liberia in western Africa in the coming months. The mission, which is being undertaken under United Nations auspices, has our full support and I wish our troops well.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">As the Minister pointed out, our troops are being deployed to an inherently dangerous theatre of operations, according to an assessment by our key military personnel visited the country on a reconnaissance trip to ascertain the level of difficulty involved in the mission. We should not be under any illusions that this mission will not be dangerous and difficult for our troops. As the Minister noted, Liberia is one of the most unstable regions in the world, not only because it has suffered civil war for the past 14 years, but also due to widespread disease. The country features at or near the top of a United Nations list ranking the incidence of disease in the region. As the mission will be possibly the most dangerous deployment ever undertaken by the Defence Forces, it is important the House wishes our troops well and assures them of our full support.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Earlier this week, Senator Maurice Hayes reminded us that Armistice Day and the many hundreds of thousands of Irish people who gave their lives in two world wars are commemorated on 11 November. We should not forget that since the Defence Forces were formed, 82 of our troops have given their lives for the cause of the United Nations, helping to bring peace and security to various parts of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The deployment to Liberia is not a peacekeeping mission, but a peace enforcement role, which makes it much more dangerous for the troops involved and difficult for the families they will leave at home. It was correct and honest of the Minister to inform the public some weeks ago that the mission would not last for six months or a year but at least two or three years given that elections are not scheduled to take place in Liberia until 2005. This is not, therefore, a short-term mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I was distraught at the response of the United States Government to the crisis as it emerged during the summer months when rebel troops approached and entered Monrovia and Charles Taylor refused to relinquish power. It was pathetic to see US aircraft carriers anchored off the coast of Monrovia watching events, while the US Administration refused to send troops, apart from a small number of marines dispatched to protect the US ambassador who remained in the city. The United States has a special responsibility to Liberia given the long history of slave trading between the US and western Africa and the large-scale repatriation of many Americans to Liberia in the earlier part of the last century. I have expressed support for the United States Government in the House on many issues, but on this occasion it has not fulfilled its special responsibility to the Liberian people. As a friendly country, we should point this out to the United States in an open and honest manner. While there is an international responsibility to commit troops to the mission, there is a particular onus on the United States because of its historical connection with Liberia.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Senators will not be shocked to learn that Liberia is one of the poorest country's in the world. An estimated 85% of its people live below the poverty line while the region has endured a tortuous civil war for the past 14 years. The former President, Mr. Charles Taylor, is now wanted for war crimes in Sierra Leone. We must question the motives of the Nigerian Government in giving asylum to this man, who has committed atrocious crimes. As part of the deal he has been let out of Liberia and allowed to remain in Nigeria, which I understand, but we must confront the fact that over 200,000 people have been killed in the past ten years alone in that region in very difficult circumstances. A total of 500,000 people have been displaced from their homes. I congratulate Concern on its work in Liberia. My brother-in-law is with Concern in Liberia at present and is due home shortly, after completing six months there. In the past few months I have received e-mails from him. It is harrowing to read about the difficult situation for people in that country. Many NGOs had to leave Liberia. Concern left but subsequently returned. Its members are extremely brave people. I pay tribute to the Concern personnel who have put so much time in recent months into helping the refugees who have left the villages, where there were appalling scenes of carnage, for Monrovia. Many brave young Irish men and women have gone to Liberia over the past six months and have stayed with the people, even during the most difficult period over the summer when the place was virtually ungovernable and there was no security or law and order.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Our troops face a difficult task. There are part of a contingent of 15,000 UN troops. Their first task will be to separate the warring factions. The second task is to disarm the many young soldiers. Boys as young as seven or eight years are enlisted in the army and in the warring factions in the region. The place is awash with arms and people will have to be disarmed as soon as possible. In addition, people will have to be returned to, and kept safe in, their homes. Our troops will play a key role in that regard. This mission will not be short lived, given the instability of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">I wish to make a point about the triple lock arrangement. The Minister will be aware of the comments made in the other House by our party spokesperson and in this House by Senator Minihan on 1 April this year. We need to debate the future of Ireland's participation in UN missions. Ireland could not send troops to Macedonia, a place that has as much, if not more, connection with Ireland as Liberia, because one member of the Security Council, China, took umbrage at Macedonia's support for the exiled leader of Tibet. The deployment of our troops should not be based solely on the veto of one or two members of the UN Security Council. If the Dáil and the Government wish to send troops to parts of the world which are trying to achieve peace and security and, therefore, to endorse the UN Charter, they should be able to do so irrespective of whether there is a UN resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Our party has introduced a Bill to deal with this issue on which we hope to encourage debate. Ireland was the only country in the EU that was unable to send troops to Macedonia due to the triple lock mechanism. That mechanism must be challenged. I urge that a debate take place on it, especially on foot of the brave Private Members' Bill put forward by our spokesperson, Deputy Gay Mitchell. Macedonia is also important because at some point in the future it is likely to become a member of the European Union so we have a responsibility in that regard. We should determine our foreign policy on the basis of our needs and in the context of the EU. The EU will have greater responsibility for matters such as peace enforcement and peacekeeping in the future and our decisions on participation should not be determined by the political considerations of one member of the Security Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">I wish to describe the case of a woman in Liberia who was forced to leave her home because of the rebel actions. The information can be found on the Concern website. It shows the type of situation people in that country face. The woman's name is Alice Brown and she is a mother of two. She was displaced from her home in Liberia and went to Monrovia. She is one of the 200,000 people who have been displaced. She said:</p>
          <p eId="para_232">I arrived here [the Concern camp] 10 days ago after walking for four days from [my home village]. There were thousands of people on the road with me. . I put my one year old on my back and the two year old walked. Her feet and ankles swelled up and she was in terrible pain for much of the journey. I kept telling her we were nearly there but I was lying.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">We had no food for the journey, all we took was water. The children are not taking from the breast any more which made it more difficult for them. This is the first time we have been displaced. It felt so bad to be forced from my home like this. I am from Tubman Street in Buchanan city. I thank and praise God that I found my way to the displacement centre. I left Buchanan because of the MODEL troops who were terrorising the people in the town. . They looted all the houses in Buchanan. Many women were raped and many innocent people were killed in the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">They even raped pregnant women, old women and young girls. Some women's rectums were violated. I was not raped. I managed to hold on to my foam mattress but as soon as I made it onto the road I encountered some soldiers who took it off me. They pushed me and told me to keep walking.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">I want this war to end. I am suffering too much. I pray for it to end. . I am aware of what Concern are doing here in the camp. I see the children singing every evening. They make sure everyone listens. They tell us to wash our hands before eating and cooking. Concern have also constructed many latrines. If they were not here there would be so much more disease. I have small children, who are the most vulnerable to disease so I appreciate how important their work is. Concern have also constructed washing rooms so we can wash in private. In a crowded place like this that is important. It gives us our dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">That is an example of the suffering one woman has had to face as a result of the political instability in that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">We are doing important international work today. It is something of which this country should be proud. The troops go in our name and act on our behalf. They, and particularly their families, deserve our support, especially as we go into the Christmas season. I wish the troops well in Liberia and I hope they return safely to their families as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatMoylan" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_238">The Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, is an important and active Minister in the Government. I compliment on and thank him for his work for the Defence Forces. It is acknowledged throughout the country that the Minister has made a major contribution to the development of facilities for the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">I will outline the reason our troops are going to Liberia. The people of Ireland are proud to have troops with the ability and training to take on this important work. Last October the west African peacekeepers in Liberia traded their camouflage helmets for the blue helmets of UN forces, inaugurating a new UN mission intended to secure lasting peace for a nation in ruins after 14 years of conflict. In August, Nigerian troops were the first to arrive to halt the fighting between rebel groups and the government of former warlord Charles Taylor. The Nigerian-led peace force succeeded in imposing a ceasefire in Monrovia, ending fighting that killed more than 1,000 civilians in the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Mr. Taylor resigned under international pressure on 11 August, leading to a power sharing and peace deal between the government and rebels. Liberia descended into chaos in 1989 when Mr. Taylor, then a warlord, invaded the country from neighbouring Ivory Coast. Following his seven year insurgency that led to the death of more than 150,000 people, war weary Liberians elected him president in 1997. Insurgents took up arms against him in 1999 and marched on the capital in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Mr. Taylor's financial support for rebel forces in Guinea, Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone created enormous hardship in those countries. The United Nations banned sales of diamonds from Liberia in 1990 in an attempt to cut off Mr. Taylor's source of funds and thus limit the amount he could funnel to rebel insurrections in neighbouring countries. His contributions to rebels in Sierra Leone fuelled a bitter civil war in that country. His main ally, the Revolutionary United Front, has been accused of widespread torture and sexual assault.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">In June 2003, a UN backed court indicted Mr. Taylor for crimes against humanity during the civil war in Sierra Leone. Much is needed to revive the country, which was once one of Africa's richest. It does not have functioning electrical systems or roads and hundreds of thousands of civilians are living as refugees. The power sharing Government is scheduled to take over. That will lead to elections and a democratically elected Government in early 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The cause of peace sometimes comes at a price, as the loss of 83 personnel since 1960 has shown. However, our Defence Forces have over the years demonstrated that they are capable of facing security risks. In the Lebanon in particular, where hundreds of our personnel served over a 25 year period, many difficult situations were faced. When the mission concluded in 2001, it was widely recognised that the Irish handled these situations in a highly professional manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Irish military neutrality is a policy to which the Government is deeply committed. Ireland, however, has never been ideologically neutral nor morally indifferent to the major international and security challenges of the day. Ours is not a rigid neutrality, frozen in time and isolated from the evolving international security realities. Ireland's neutrality originated as an important expression of sovereignty and became practically possible in 1938 when the British returned the treaty ports to Irish control. Irish neutrality has not been imposed from outside nor is it guaranteed by international treaty. It is a policy espoused by successive Governments and its core defining characteristic is non-membership of military alliances. Our neutrality has gone hand in hand with a strong commitment to international co-operation for stability and security.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">There is no conflict between Ireland's military neutrality and full and active support by Ireland for collective security based on international law. The progressive approach taken by Éamon de Valera in the League of Nations in the 1930s is clear evidence of that. When faced with the challenge to international security of Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia, Ireland supported sanctions against Mussolini. The League of Nations was, however, unable to deal effectively with aggressor states led by dictators because of the absence from the League of the United States and the weakness of the League's enforcement mechanisms. As the League of Nations failed to meet its responsibilities, the world descended into war.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The history of Europe from 1935 to 1945 clearly shows that military neutrality on its own is not enough to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally. It is also necessary to work actively for international peace and security, taking account of prevailing circumstances. In advocating UN membership to Dáil Éireann in 1946, Éamon de Valera emphasised his hope that the UN would be better able to act against an aggressor than the League of Nations when he said: "Either the time for action is going to pass in futile discussion or there must be a method by which effective forcible action will be taken". He also emphasised that</p>
          <p eId="para_247">"if there is ever to be a rule of law, nations must make up their minds that they will take part in such enforcement, because, if there is not enforcement, then, of course, the duties and the rights that are guaranteed will be all thrown aside".</p>
          <p eId="para_248">It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that the safety of our personnel is at the top of the agenda. While one cannot give absolute guarantees regarding safety, we must analyse the risks involved. In addition to ensuring that intensive training is undertaken, robust and modern protection assets, including armoured military vehicles and personnel carriers, must be deployed. Our troops deserve the best equipment and facilities we can give them. I welcome the Minister's statement that such equipment and facilities will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Although 20 countries will participate, Ireland will be the only western country to make a significant contribution. That fact illustrates the high regard the UN has for us. It knows our track record and we should be honoured that the unique qualities of Irish peacekeepers continue to be recognised. Irish peacekeepers are among the most acceptable from the contributing nations' community of troops for several reasons, including their high standards of experience. As Ireland is a neutral country, which was not a colonial power, our troops are recognised as being impartial. The Defence Forces bring more than 40 years' experience to peacekeeping. That gives the Irish soldier an almost unique understanding of the requirements for peace support operations. Irish soldiers have a talent to earn the trust and confidence of the conflicting parties and the local population and have demonstrated their ability to defuse potentially explosive situations by tact, dialogue and humour.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The Congo operation in 1960 marked the first opportunity for the Defence Forces to serve alongside armies from other nations. That experience showed that Irish troops were as well trained and suited to peacekeeping as those of any other nationality. Subsequent peacekeeping experiences in places such as the Lebanon, Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor and Cyprus have reinforced that conviction. Speaking during a visit to Ireland in 1998, the former US President, Bill Clinton, said that he could not leave Ireland without acknowledging that there were few nations which had contributed more than Ireland, even in times of difficulty for this country, to the cause of peace and human rights around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Once the full Irish contingent has been deployed to Liberia, more than 800 Defence Forces personnel will be serving in 19 overseas missions. That is the largest commitment since the Lebanon and represents almost 10% of the entire force. We are punching well above our weight on behalf of peace and we should all be proud of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I appreciate the comments of the Army officers' association, RACO, which has expressed concern about the level of medical backup for troops who are being sent on a peace mission to Liberia in west Africa. It states that it wants more information about medical services in what it describes as an inherently dangerous situation in Liberia. I welcome the Minister's statement that the demands of RACO have been complied with. I know his commitment to the Defence Forces. If more is required he will not be found wanting. When money was scarce in the past the Minister found ways of providing facilities and equipment for our armed forces. He disposed of surplus land that had lain idle for many years to ensure that the Defence Forces were not left short when extra equipment and facilities were required. I compliment him on his work as Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">We all wish our forces well. I know it is difficult for them because of the time of year they must leave – coming up to Christmas – but our soldiers are of the very highest calibre and they take their work seriously. They will do us proud in Liberia.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_254">I welcome the Minister to the House. Naturally I am most supportive of this effort in conjunction with the United Nations. It is wise to remember, however, that as Senator Brian Hayes said, this is a peace-enforcing exercise. Senator Moylan mentioned the Congo, the only other peace enforcing exercise in which we have been involved where we suffered serious losses. Our troops are facing danger but I am sure the Minister and the Chief of Staff would not allow them to undertake a mission for which they were not properly equipped and trained. We can let them go forward with our full support.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">This mission should have started many years ago. The people of Liberia have suffered grievously over the last ten years. It is good to see our troops going out in solidarity with a force that is mainly African, including 15,000 Nigerians. Our experience in many other parts of the world will be particularly useful to those who are less experienced. Like Senator Hayes, I was disgusted with the behaviour of the United States Administration during the summer. It must have been dreadful for the people of Liberia to see aircraft and naval carriers on the horizon and nobody coming to put a stop to the fighting. They have appealed to America to help them. It is extraordinary that a few hundred troops cannot be spared when there are 150,000 in Iraq who were not asked to be there.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I am glad the Taoiseach told Mr. Berlusconi we were not happy with Mr. Putin's actions in Chechnya, where human rights are being abused. It is not media exaggeration. I hope the Minister will convey to the Taoiseach my appreciation of his taking the time to tell Mr. Berlusconi we support the European Union's view in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">Senator Moylan pointed out that it will be a long time before there are elections in Liberia and I presume our troops will have to stay until they take place. The political situation is unclear. We must rely on the Liberians to deal with that while we ensure that the country is as peaceful as possible so that democratic elections can take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I was glad to hear the Minister mention the problem of child soldiers. This has become a terrible problem in Africa. In Sudan and northern Uganda, children are kidnapped on a regular basis and forced to fight. They can be as young as seven and many of them are girls. Church leaders have contacted me about what is happening in Sudan and have asked me to make sure that, wherever possible, we make clear our abhorrence of this practice. I am sure the Minister will do that. Another problem for our soldiers in Liberia was illustrated on television recently. Most of these young people are on drugs. The leaders of rebel groups put them on drugs and give them all kinds of weapons: guns, machetes and so on. It was horrific to hear children talking about this and showing the amputations of hands and feet which had been done by children of their own ages.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The Minister did not mention voodoo, but I ask him to make sure that the troops obtain local information about this. I have been to west Africa and it is a powerful force, although as I have not been to Liberia I cannot say whether this is true there. Every market contains stalls with fetishes and sometimes children are told that if they wear a certain fetish they will not be hit by bullets. It is important the soldiers are told about this. The Irish public should also know because children may be killed during this peacekeeping mission. If children are fighting because they have been told that wearing girls' clothes will magically protect him from bullets, our soldiers may not be in a position, with the best will in the world, to spare their lives. We must accept that this sort of thing will happen because, as the Minister pointed out, 70% of the combatants are minors and they have been involved in the most appalling acts. The best thing we can possibly do is to restore the peace so these children can return to some form of education and normal life, having been out of it for years.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">It is extraordinary that there should be such trouble in Liberia because it does not have great assets. The rubber trade on which it relied for so long has been overtaken by the use of petrochemicals. There is not much in the way of gold or diamonds but apparently it is a centre for smuggling, for example from Sierra Leone. This must be dealt with by our troops, which makes an added difficulty for them. As a doctor, I was interested to hear the medical issues mentioned by the Minister. They seem to be well defined. I always say that the best way to prevent malaria is to wear long sleeves and trousers tucked into one's socks in the evening. I hope plenty of insect repellent goes out with the troops because that is also useful. It is to be hoped our medical personnel will not have too many problems to deal with. Will they be able to do anything for civilians in the area if they have time on their hands? Their medical care has been appalling for a long time, with no vaccinations and so on. I do not know the protocol in these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">It was good to hear Senator Brian Hayes mention the work done by non-governmental organisations such as Concern. I am sure that if the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, has a few euro left in his budget he will try to give them something towards their work. We have made a huge effort with bilateral aid in other countries in Africa; perhaps we can spare a little for this one.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I sincerely hope that all our soldiers come back safe and well but as previous speakers said, it is a very worrying time for them and their families. They are going to help a group of people who, sadly, have been neglected, perhaps because they did not have many assets and were left on the sideline. Their pitiful pleas over several years for troops to be sent from America went unheeded and I am glad we are involved in this United Nations force which has come to aid people who do not deserve to be in the situation in which they find themselves.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_156">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_263">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the participation of members of the Defence Forces in this peace enforcing mission in Liberia. At the outset I welcome the Minister to the House. We may not have always agreed on micro issues within the Defence Forces but on a macro basis I congratulate him on his role as Minister for Defence and on the major reform in the Defence Forces, much of which has been very positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Ireland became a member of the United Nations in 1955 and, since 1958, we have had a continuous presence in peacekeeping missions, mainly in the Middle East. The extensive Irish participation in peacekeeping is regarded in very positive terms both by the Government and the Defence Forces. Indeed, in September 1993, the Government restated the role of the Defence Forces and defined one of them as being to participate in United Nations missions in the cause of international peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Ireland's participation in peacekeeping operations has promoted a very positive image of Ireland and its Defence Forces both within the international community, in the United Nations and among the various communities in various mission areas. Unfortunately, this service has not been without cost. To date, 82 members of the Defence Forces have given their lives in the cause of world peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I digress slightly at this stage to mention Private Kevin Joyce, a member of the 48th Battalion, who is missing in action since 1981. Now that we have successfully completed our mission in Lebanon, I ask that we would continue efforts on a diplomatic level to recover what are believed to be the remains of Private Joyce and bring them home for a Christian burial. I hope we do not lose sight of that one Irish soldier whose remains have never been found.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">It is an undisputed fact that the success of peacekeeping missions primarily depends on the desires of the warring parties to resolve their differences peacefully. It equally depends on the support of the international community working in concert with a clear mandate and the provision of the resources necessary for the successful conclusion of the mandate objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Ireland's participation in overseas missions is underpinned by the confirmation in the Seville declaration that this country's participation remains firmly grounded in the UN as the international authority for the co-operative arrangements for collective security. This decision making process for involvement in the peace support operations requires the conditions of the triple lock, that is, United Nations authorisation together with Government and Dáil approval, and it is a matter of some regret that this Chamber does not also have a legislative role in the approval of overseas deployment of Irish troops. That, however, is an argument for another day. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue and also welcome the decision of the Dáil yesterday to approve this mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">On the subject of the triple lock, if I may digress briefly, mention has been made that in certain circumstances missions the Government believes to be desirable may be blocked by the veto of a permanent member of the Security Council. This is to be regretted. It is long past time that this subject be revisited and that we debate all aspects of the triple lock and, on a wider front, reform of the UN Security Council. These, too, are arguments for another day because this debate is about Liberia.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">As has been stated by the Minister, this mission is not without risk. Nevertheless, it is without question correct for the Defence Forces to play an active role in this mission. Not alone is the professionalism of our Defence Forces ideally suited to the successful conclusion of the mission but Ireland, during our period on the Security Council, was among the strongest supporters of the targeted sanctions of the former Liberian regime. Now that that regime has fallen, we have a moral responsibility to help build a lasting peace in Liberia. We have already shown our support for Liberia through the provision to date this year of €2.5 million in emergency humanitarian assistance. This deployment is another sign of our commitment to the country and to the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The success of peacekeeping missions largely depends on the desire of warring parties to resolve their differences peacefully. In this regard, Liberia is still volatile and unstable. However, I have faith in those in the Defence Forces who undertook the risk assessment and advised the Minister accordingly. Our Defence Forces are a professional army with a well-earned reputation for their ability to partake in peacekeeping missions anywhere in the world. In this regard, it was disappointing to see in the media and to hear some misguided suggestions from the Opposition to the contrary. Much of what has been and will be said in this House about the mission is theoretical. As a former peacekeeper, having served three tours of duty in Lebanon, I would like to put a human face on the tasks faced by our Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The task of a peacekeeper is particularly demanding because peacekeeping operations are, by definition, established in areas of conflict where acts of violence and breaches of international and locally arranged agreements are daily occurrences. Those who serve in peacekeeping forces are equipped with light defensive weapons but are not authorised to use force except in self defence. This right is exercised judiciously because of the obvious danger that if a UN force uses weapons, its impartiality, however unfairly, is called into question. This particular mission is one under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and is a peace enforcing mission. This requirement sometimes demands exceptional restraint on the part of soldiers serving in peacekeeping forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Irish peacekeepers are among the most acceptable from the communities of troop contributing nations for several reasons which include their high standard of experience and the fact that our troops are recognised as being impartial because Ireland, as a neutral country, was never a colonial power. The Defence Forces brings over 40 years of experience to peacekeeping. This gives the Irish soldier an almost unique understanding of the requirements for peace support operations. Irish soldiers have a talent to earn the trust and confidence of conflicting parties and the local population and have demonstrated their ability to defuse potentially explosive situations by tact, dialogue and humour. Senator Henry referred to voodoo. That reminds me of a situation in Lebanon where we encountered similar activities but by deploying the Irish pipe band, we introduced our own version of voodoo, which defused a potentially explosive situation. It is amazing what a piper can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">My major concern about this particular mission is the issue of child soldiers. These young boys and girls, who are fully armed and have been force-fed a cocktail of cocaine by senior officers, aggressively engage in conflict. This is a new departure for our Defence Forces but I am confident that military authorities, who are <i>au fait</i> with the very clear rules of engagement in this situation, have provided the necessary training and support mechanisms for this new challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">The widespread contamination of Liberia with a particularly virulent strain of malaria concerns not just me but every Member of the House. I am glad the Dutch have sent a level 3 ship to provide medical support to the force but I ask the Minister again to keep that under review and ensure that full medical support, including equipment and vaccinations, is available at all times to our troops.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">With regard to medical provisions, I am also aware that our soldiers will operate in an environment where AIDS is endemic in the population. This is something on which no one else has touched. Will the Minister outline what provisions have been made to ensure the safe supply of properly screened blood if it should be needed by our troops? Given that blood supply has a shelf life of 35 days, there is a need to put in place a mechanism for the supply of properly screened blood on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The Irish element of this force will be deployed as a mobile reserve element to the overall force. This places our troops at the cutting edge of the mission. With that comes huge responsibilities to ensure that reaction to any situation is measured and responsible. Our troops have been selected for this role because of their reputation in previous missions but with that comes huge responsibilities, of which we should not lose sight.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I stress the importance of showing political support to our Defence Forces. It is one thing to debate these issues in the House, and I thank the Leader for responding to my request for such a debate. I also thank the Minister for giving us his time. However, political responsibility must follow on from the decision made in the Dáil yesterday. Our Defence Forces have served this country proudly at home and abroad and with distinction since the foundation of the State. I hope the political system will support this mission on a continuous basis and that it will actively monitor the role of the Defence Forces in Liberia with regular statements in the House on the welfare of our troops in line with our responsibility to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Supporting our troops not only involves providing them with necessary equipment and the means to carry out their task, it also means looking after their welfare. I have a concern which I wish to put to the Minister. Serving overseas is not a nine to five, five days a week job, which the Minister will know from his tours. It is a 24 hour per day, seven days per week mission. We are sending troops to Liberia on a six month tour of duty. On average, a member of the Defence Forces on such a mission would receive two weeks' leave and maybe a weekend in between. When we served in Lebanon, we could take that leave in Cyprus, Israel or in Egypt and some of our families came out to join us. However, a rest and recuperation facility is not readily available in Liberia. This is a concern because soldiers need that break.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">When soldiers are on a 12 month tour of duty, they are given one return trip home. I am not trying to create a precedent here nor am I playing on my loyalty to my former colleagues, but this situation is unique because of the geographical location of Liberia. Will the Minister consider bringing forward an imaginative approach to the leave period for troops in Liberia? If soldiers want to come home, that trip should be paid for by the State. The cost of getting out of Liberia back to Europe is in excess of €2,000. Maybe we could devise an imaginative approach, for example a supply flight whereby we could repatriate troops for a two week period. When we served in Lebanon, the Norwegians and the Finns were repatriated even if they were only on a six month tour of duty. Repatriation of our troops is only paid for if they are on a 12 month tour of duty. Will the Minister look at that?</p>

          <p eId="para_282">I accept that but we have a responsibility to take our troops out of that theatre for a two week period. We should not impose huge financial costs on them in order to avail of that facility. Given the uniqueness of the situation, will the Minister look at that positively? It is a sincere request. It would constitute a once-off basis for this mission, as I am not trying to create a precedent.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">As a former member of the Defence Forces, I am acutely aware not only of the commitment made by our troops, but of the huge support from wives and families. In recent years, support for the families of troops overseas has improved dramatically. The big breakthrough for us in 1988 was a visit from Mick Dunne to Lebanon. Talking to him privately one night, we succeeded in having the All-Ireland football and hurling finals broadcast to us by telephone link. It created a great atmosphere among the troops. The western command flew red and green flags on their Land Rovers while the southern command flew red and white flags because Cork was playing Mayo. Since the Israelis used a mechanism of colour coded flags on the back of their vehicles to signal each other, there was consternation when they saw these new colours flying on our jeeps. They did not know what was going on.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_289">I thank the Minister for his presentation. He talked about Ireland's contribution to the United Nations in particular, to peacekeeping missions, our experience in that area and our financial and personnel contributions. I pay tribute to our Defence Forces for their work in peacekeeping and recognise the price that has been paid by those who have been killed or injured on these missions. Members have pointed out that this is a dangerous mission. The Minister acknowledged that Liberia is highly unstable and that the peace process is fragile. As has been said, peacekeeping is important for Ireland, so much so that we talk about it in terms of a duty. It is important we do our best to ensure the safety of our troops, which is a permanent duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Many people have mentioned that there is a fear this mission will be peace enforcement rather than peacekeeping. However, it is important we ensure our role is peacekeeping and not peace enforcement, and certainly not the suppression of war. It is also important we know our role and our limits and stand by them. If it came to it, we should know when it is time to consider withdrawing our troops. The Minister spoke of the risk assessment which has been carried out prior to making the decision to undertake the mission. It is important it becomes an ongoing process.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I agree with Senator Minihan on the role of this House in that it should continue to monitor the situation and hold ongoing debates on the progress of the mission. I will be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The Minister has given assurances on the medical and water purification facilities and the other equipment which will be provided. However, as my colleague, Deputy Sherlock has rightly pointed out, the Government is cutting back on spending on defence. Is the Government going to provide the Defence Forces with the necessary resources to ensure these assurances given by the Minister become a reality?</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Other issues were raised by my colleagues in the Dáil. Deputy Higgins raised the need to take on board the views of those who will be involved in or serve on the mission and those who would have previous experience of peacekeeping missions. Deputy Higgins mentioned the fear that because there have been a lot of retirements from the Army the age profile of those going to Liberia might be younger and that even though they might have other advantages through being younger, they would not have the same level of experience as older members of the Defence Forces. I am not saying that is the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_297">I join with other Senators in thanking the Minister for Defence for coming here and the readiness with which his office responded when we contacted them about the debate. We are aware that under the Constitution the matter must be debated and decided in Dáil Éireann, but we felt that while we did not have the deciding role, we should have the listening role and the right to hear the Minister's plans. Also we felt we should discuss the people going in our name to Liberia.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The debate, which I have been following, has been very good. While not taking from others who spoke, it is good we have somebody like Senator John Minihan, who has the inside track and who has served three tours of duty in the Lebanon. Clearly he is contributing on the basis of a very rounded perspective on overseas duty and what it entails and also what it means for our people who are there.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I speak from a particular perspective as on this occasion, apart from the 40 Rangers and 14 staff from headquarters, between 370 and 380 personnel are from the western command, mainly Custume Barracks in Athlone. For me, there is a real interest in this, as there would always be given I come from a town which has the headquarters of the western command, which is a huge Army base. I know intimately many of the people who will be going and their families, some of whom live on the same street as me. All speakers, and the Minister when he spoke here today and on television, touched on the welfare of those who will travel and those who will stay at home and wait for their return. Their welfare is a high priority for those at the head of the Defence Forces and for the Minister, which is to be highly regarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I remember, as a very young girl in 1958, the first occasion our Defence Forces went overseas. On that occasion quite a contingent went from Athlone and the western command. Usually, the overseas contingents are drawn from the various commands, but on this occasion it is centred on the western command. Therefore, the personnel will know one another very well. That will show its worth in a place like Liberia, which will be completely different from other peacekeeping missions. The earlier missions in the Congo and the later ones in Cyprus and the Lebanon became familiar to us. Indeed, the towns in those countries and their names were on the lips of young children as they played around Athlone as their fathers, uncles or brothers were abroad and they were cognisant of where they were and what they were doing. Sadly, of course, brave lives were lost. When one reads that we have to be absolutely sure, as the Minister touched on in his speech, that our personnel are going to perfectly safe environments, we need to realise that if they were perfectly safe environments they would not have to go. The purpose is to render them safer, in partnership with others, and in so doing to remove dangers, but it is a dangerous situation for anybody who goes to serve overseas. One is often in a very hostile climate and a strange land. One has to get on with the people one is hoping to help and with one's fellow defence personnel in one's own force and in the forces one is joining. It requires great skill and professionalism, particularly the skills of interaction with other people, which is a necessary trait in those who travel overseas on peacekeeping duties. In many cases, the Irish Defence Forces who go overseas show terrific skills of interaction in extending friendship in very ordinary ways to children, older people and the people of the villages and towns in which they are based.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Let us put ourselves in the minds of the men and women of our forces who are going. They are trained professionally and are full of bravery in their hearts and minds, but it is a different matter by the time they get to a place with different temperatures, voices, situations, all of which they cannot be aware of. They have a mammoth duty to perform and they do it with dignity, skill, professionalism and pride in the Irish Defence Forces. I have seen very young men who have gone overseas come home as men who have grown in maturity as a result of the experience they have gained.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Liberia, and Africa in general, is a place with which Ireland has a rapport going back many hundreds of years. Our work there in various fields has always been applauded. While it will be a strange new venue for peacekeeping, the echoes and the synthesis of Africa and Ireland are strong.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">I wish all the United Nations forces in Liberia great success, particularly our own forces. May they have success, happiness and safety as they work on our behalf in Liberia. I hope their touch and professionalism will bring a better standing for that war-torn country.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">I too wish the Minister for Defence and our Defence Forces who are about to be deployed to Liberia, the very best of luck and a safe passage while they are there. They deserve great praise. They are great people and I have the greatest admiration for those who go on peacekeeping missions. However, this is a little bit more than peacekeeping. Senator Hayes has pointed out the difference between peacekeeping and peace enforcement. This, according to the Minister's speech, will be more a peace enforcement than a than a peacekeeping mission for our troops. The Minister said in his speech that the proposed Irish contingent:</p>
          <p eId="para_305">will comprise a motorised infantry battalion of some 430 personnel and a small number of additional personnel who will be deployed at force headquarters and as military observers. The Irish contingent will operate as the force commander's rapid reaction force. They will provide an immediate response capability deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force to provide the swift and decisive military reaction to any crisis situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Quite clearly the Irish troops who are going on this mission will be in very dangerous territory.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I am delighted with the Minister's speech. He has made every effort to provide for the health and well-being of the battalion while it is in Liberia. This need is paramount and was well explained by Senator Minihan. It is difficult for an ordinary person such as myself to envisage the difficulties entailed in peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions but, having listened to Senator Minihan, I can imagine the difficulties encountered. I am delighted the Minister has taken all necessary precautions to provide for our soldiers while they are overseas. They deserve great credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Everyone knows of someone who has been a casualty of a peacekeeping mission. Great trauma has been experienced by soldiers who were injured and by the families and friends of those who were killed. It is important the State and the agencies responsible for making the necessary provisions ensure that the needs of our armed forces and their families are provided for while they are on peacekeeping missions of two or three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">I am delighted that the Minister has assured us that every aspect of the operation has been taken care of. I wish our troops the best of luck and I thank the Minister for coming into the House. Provision has been made for this matter to be debated in the Dáil. I am pleased it is being debated in the Seanad also. I thank the Minister for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_318">I speak on this motion, first because I want to wish our troops well. As the nearest thing to a pacifist in this House, I believe our Army does a superb job abroad. I have had the opportunity, as part of various Oireachtas delegations, to meet the troops serving abroad. I met them in Cyprus on one occasion and, although not on an official visit, I met some of our troops in a dodgy environment in the Gaza Strip in the 1980s when Deputies Tony Gregory and Joe Sherlock and I visited there. Although we were guests of the uprising rather than of the Israeli Government, we met some Irish troops who were working there. One cannot but be impressed by their commitment, particularly to non-violent conflict, and their determination that the use of force is the last item on their agenda. That was made extremely clear to me. I wish them well.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I will not go through the list of arrangements made for the support of our troops. I assume that we have a professional Defence Force and that the basic back-up will be provided. I am old enough to remember, however, the first deployment of troops to the Congo and the shock of the tragedy of the Niemba ambush. Even then, Irish politicians and the general public retained a belief that these things are worth doing, despite the very rude awakening of seeing a military procession through Dublin more than 40 years ago.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_322">I was only 13 at the time but it was an enormous shock to all of us. Nevertheless, the people of this country could see that what was being done was worth doing. That trauma, if anything, deepened our sense that this was a worthwhile thing for our Defence Forces to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The history of Liberia is an enormous reproach to western civilisation. Liberia is a consequence of the slave trade. It was populated by slaves who were liberated back to that country from the United States. While what has been done there and the brutality of the war is beyond description we must remember that western society, in its history of colonisation and slave trading, has played a major part in the creation of that tragic country. This does not excuse anything that is going on now. However, the great Christian powers of Europe were the driving force of the slave trade from Africa to North America, out of which came the slaves who founded Liberia. Ireland does not have anything to apologise for in this regard. However, this is not an issue of a tragic country but of the historical obligation of western Europe and North America to places like Africa, in the light of the harm done in the name of our civilisation on the African continent, particularly through the slave trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">This is one of the most risky and difficult tasks undertaken by our Defence Forces. I do not make light of any of their missions but this one is different. That is not a reason not to do it. I accept the professional judgment of our Defence Forces and of the collective international community that a properly equipped military force can, notwithstanding the risks, make a dramatic contribution to stabilising a tragic country and region. It appears that the presence of Irish troops is a necessary part of the stabilisation of Liberia and its neighbouring countries, a region which is torn by enormous strife. Senator Minihan mentioned the use of child soldiers, which seems to be a new and African phenomenon. It also happened in Uganda. If we can bring an end to that sort of thing it is worth taking part in peacekeeping missions, even if they involve a risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">I wish our troops well. I assume the necessary back-up provisions for their health and safety have been made. The need for decent rest and recreation is a necessary part of that and I have considerable sympathy with what Senator Minihan said about this. If more can be done, I hope the Minister will consider doing it.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_326">I never expect thanks for coming to the Seanad for any debate. I like coming back to this House, which is a special part of my experience. The unanimous support for an issue as important as Irish troops going to Liberia and the nice remarks made by every contributor about our Defence Forces is something I always want to hear. It will be possible to translate that good will into greater confidence for the troops who are facing risks and difficulties in Liberia. We have taken note of the ideas put forward here about how we might improve the circumstances and make life easier for our troops. We will continue to do this and will look at it again in light of the first week's experience in Liberia.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Senator Ryan and others are correct when they say that while we have faced many difficult terrains in the past, we have probably not faced one as difficult as this. Over the past month the military has gone to exceptional lengths in its reconnaissance to check out every aspect that could be thought about. All the angles are covered in as far as we can do this. While we would like to be in a position to give guarantees, we are not able to go that far.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Under our reorganisation into three battalions, the contingents will be drawn from the west, south and east in turn. The troops will be used to working and performing with each other. This should strengthen the camaraderie that is so necessary, as the troops will be tested and hard decisions will have to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I thank the Members for their conscientious, deliberate and supportive contributions. Our soldiers will take the message with them that they have the wholehearted support of both Houses of the Oireachtas. We can only hope that as the months wear on, we will be saved from any atrocities like those that happened to us in the past. We have lost 84 men since 1958. The Niemba ambush in the Congo left an indelible memory in my mind. I was attending secondary school at the time and remember the great solemnity and seriousness of the funerals. Irish soldiers did not refrain and missions have gone on for 40 years on every continent.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Our troops have covered themselves in glory, particularly with their ability to move away from their military training and peacekeeping abilities to humanitarian tasks. They have written their name indelibly on orphanages, medical clinics and schools. I think of Camp Clarke near Pristina. The homes of two brothers near there were burnt down by Milosevic's troops. The brothers had eight children between them, four of whom had special needs. The families had no winter facilities and snow was lying on the ground. Irish troops renovated the cow byre in a couple of days and the families lived there until two new houses were built. I was there when the houses were nearly finished. While the cooker had been installed the windows had not and the families had moved into the house. A beautiful little deaf and dumb daughter of one of the brothers showed me her room and we had our photograph taken. When I returned much later she caught me by the hand and brought me in to show me the photograph. By then the houses had been completed. There was such joy to be seen on their faces, even when the windows had not been installed. I mention this to demonstrate the good work that can be carried out when a certain amount of peace falls on a place. Such work cannot be carried out in the beginning; the problems must first be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Somewhere in our genes, we Irish understand famine. We certainly understand oppression and domination and this is reflected in our songs and poetry. When we go to places that now have the kind of difficulties that once were ours, we understand them better than most. As Senator Ryan said, our soldiers have a great ability to iron out things. The arrangements that are made behind the scenes are similar to paragraphs four and five of the Downing Street Declaration, where paragraph four was compiled by extremists on one side while paragraph five was compiled by extremists on the other. Irish troops have exceptionally good skills and can bring together different groups in the search for peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">It has been a tremendous experience for me to watch this happen at first hand. I have made ten visits to the Lebanon and it is nice to hear from someone who has had first hand knowledge. B Company in Lebanon had a couple of lucky escapes. Shells penetrated the blocks on the stairwell where only seconds before our troops had passed. Somebody in the heavens was looking after them on that occasion. One of our soldiers was badly injured in Lebanon. When I visited him in hospital in Israel the doctors told me he was a miracle man. They said they would not have been able to do anything for him were it not for what had been done for him by his colleagues when he was wounded. It shows that immediate medical attention is of critical importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">On this mission, we will have the best field hospital and facilities we have ever had. Two doctors, 13 paramedics and level two hospitals will back up our troops. We are grateful to the Dutch for providing a hospital ship that is due to arrive in Liberia in the coming days. This will provide tertiary treatment and the most sophisticated surgical and medical facilities. While we hope our need for these will not be great, it is available if needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I thank Members for their support for the contingent. Let us all hope that when next we discuss such matters, all of our troops will have returned safely home and have been replaced by the next contingent.</p>

          <p eId="para_336">I thank the Cathaoirleach for his warm welcome and also thank the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, who wrote to me on the subject of MEPs addressing the Seanad. It is customary on occasions such as this to express how delighted one is to be invited here. I am not merely delighted, I am thrilled to be here.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">When elected to the European Parliament in 1984 one of the first suggestions I made was that MEPs be required, not invited or allowed, to participate in some aspect of discussions here on European legislation. I suggested we should be called upon to participate in debates and to inform our colleagues in the Oireachtas about the work we were doing, how we were going about it and how it could be of extreme importance to the work being done in both Houses. Unfortunately, MEPs were not even a twinkle in Mr. de Valera's eye when drafting the Constitution. I was told again and again that such a matter would have to be put to the people by way of referendum. Happily the Leader of the House decided she knows best, as she does on many issues. I thank her for inviting me here and hope it is a tradition that will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The volume of legislation that has gone through my hands in the past 19 years is staggering. Some time ago, I was highly unimpressed by the then Oireachtas committee on third legislation, which MEPs were allowed to attend but at which they could not speak. At the three meetings of the committee which I attended, a report was introduced and passed over because it had since been voted into legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs is doing a good job. It is interesting for us, as Members of the European Parliament, to consider how our colleagues at home tease out matters. Only one member state – Denmark – has a parliamentary committee at which real discussions on European legislation takes place before it is voted on.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">As I am the first MEP to have the privilege to address this House I will give Senators a brief idea of how we go about our work. Many Senators may have already been to the European Parliament. Each MEP is entitled to a full place on one parliamentary committee of which there are 19. Many MEPs are supplementary members of various other committees. For example, I am a member of the Civil Liberties Committee which deals with issues such as immigration and asylum. I am also a member of the Petitions Committee. It was as a member of that committee that I was invited to take on the role of President's mediator on matters relating to abducted children. I was appointed because the committee was receiving a considerable number of requests from parents whose children had been abducted. It was decided it was best to appoint one person to deal with these often delicate and dangerous cases. I have been involved in that work for eight years and have been re-appointed by five successive Presidents of the Parliament. The issue is, no doubt, of interest to many Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I will now try to give Senators a brief idea of the kind of work MEPs do. It may sound like a repetition of what Senators do as part of their daily work. I made a list of items on which I have spoken in the past week. My colleagues in the European Parliament are amazed at the amount of issues with which Irish politicians are expected to deal. Some years ago I had, for a brief time, a German researcher working with me in Brussels. After about three weeks he expressed his disbelief at the volume of work created in the office. He told me that all he had to do when working for a German colleague was to recycle the odd article for various magazines.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The type of intimacy that we, as Irish parliamentarians, have with our electorate is almost unknown in many other countries. Within the European Parliament some Members are elected from national list systems. We may think we have a problem making our work known here but that does not matter greatly in many other countries where one's party decides one's place on the list. The party also decides if one is not on the list. The situation has often arisen where a Member who has been active in the Parliament – the reason he was elected to it in the first instance – is not put on the list the next time round because he did not spend enough time at home doing whatever was required to get him included on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">In the past three days I have spoken at six conferences on diabetes – it was diabetes week in the Parliament and I have done a great deal of work in that area. Last Sunday, with the Dublin Simon Community, I viewed services for homeless people. I promised the organisation I would inform the House that its main concern is not the work initially associated with it, but that of moving people on to permanent housing. That is a really big issue for them. I have dealt with several cases of child abduction. I have spoken to the pharmaceutical industry about three pieces of legislation being introduced. I have also spoken to various people concerned about the recognition of professional qualifications. I have examined food law and been lobbied by a very well known company in this country which is being dragged in front of the District Court, as we would put it, for selling a jar of capers that is not labelled in at least three different languages, one of which must be English or Irish. I will refer to that area later, simply because, I regret to say, that whenever something silly arises or something goes wrong, it has been customary and really useful to be able to blame Europe. We are certainly blamed very regularly.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Several people, including publishers and musical rights people, have contacted me about legislation going through the Parliament. Debt cancellation is another issue, as is stem cell research. One thing that must be recognised when we are working on legislation in the European Parliament is that we can have a very large, lumpy piece of legislation, with a resolution drafted from the body of the report. Many issues may be dealt with in that report, but certain lobby groups will trawl through legislation to see if there is something they can get their teeth into or that is against their opinions. I felt a little sorry for some Members, since I am sure they experience this more than I, because as I was crossing the road to come here, a little old lady raced across screaming, "You are Mary Banotti, are you not?" and when I said I was she said, "You voted for gays and lesbians, you filthy pig." I thought, "Oh dear", and I hope Senators do not have to face that too much. They should beware of her. I think she is outside the door with a couple of barricades to catch Members on their way out.</p>

          <from>Ms Banotti, MEP</from>
          <p eId="para_346">I am sure many Senators have had a fair amount of experience in that regard. I have tried in my own work to publish a monthly newsletter in one of the Dublin free sheets, hoping some of the information will get out. One must accept that most MEPs have, at this stage, become almost resigned to being treated with contempt and forgotten about. That is unfortunately what we must accept. While some members of the press are interested in our work, and we are lucky that both our main newspapers keep a permanent correspondent in Brussels, the kind of day-to-day work we do is largely unrecorded and almost inexplicable to the general public. We are unhappy about that. We try to do our best and are usually extremely grateful for opportunities to speak to schoolchildren and special interest groups to let them know what we are about out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">There are 19 committees in the Parliament, and we now have a very good spread of MEPs on them. However, when I was elected in 1984, it was clear there was only one issue about which anyone was concerned here, namely agriculture. I am not sure of the exact numbers, but I would say that well over 50% of Irish MEPs served on the agriculture committee at that stage. We had no coverage on many other issues. I was therefore extremely happy to serve on the environment committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">In 1984, the Irish, according to various studies, had the lowest level of environmental awareness in Europe. I do not take any particular credit, but I tried to raise many of the issues that have since become very much part of the country's <i>lingua franca</i>. By the time of the next election in 1989, things had begun to change, largely because the schools had begun to teach children about the environment. Our low level of environmental awareness was due mainly to our being a non-industrial country not subject to the same kind of cross-border environmental disasters, such as the pollution of the Rhine and European air pollution, though there was, of course, pollution here. I emphasise that the reason we have got to grips with environmental issues in this country is European legislation. It was only because it became absolutely <i>de rigueur</i> for us to implement many of those European directives that we began to wake up and see that we needed to do something on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I understand I am to take questions when I finish, but I would like to talk to Senators a little about the issue of child abduction. It gets a great deal of tabloid press coverage, but it is quite a serious issue in our own country. On average, there are about 100 child abduction cases in Ireland every year. The interesting thing is that they are almost equally divided between children abducted into and abducted out of the country. The legislation that governs child abduction is known as The Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. It is private international law, one of many pieces of The Hague Convention legislation. It is based on an agreement made by over 63 countries to accept a basic set of rules on child abduction. The central issue in the legislation is that the custody of a child be decided in the country where the child habitually resides. If we allowed children being taken from other countries to come home here, we could not expect them to send us back our children when they are taken elsewhere. That is the basic reasoning behind the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">In the seven years I have worked on the issue, a great many things have changed culturally. One of the most significant is the issue of fathers' rights. Fathers' access and interest in maintaining contact with their children in the event of a relationship breaking down has become really significant, which I greatly welcome. Another issue is that more and more people are marrying or having children across national borders, and many of them are here, since many Irish people travel abroad. I call some of my cases the holiday romance cases. One goes off to somewhere lovely and sunny where the beaches are white and someone perfectly beautiful with big, brown eyes and lots of lovely hair comes up, and one falls in love. As we all know, love takes a great deal of working on, and within two or three years things are very often beginning to happen. I can see that many of the Senators realise that. As a result, the mother generally decides that she does not like the man any more. The reasons she fell in love with the man initially, such as him having a great deal of time to lie on the beach and court her, become a slightly different matter when one has two children and there is no money coming in. That is often when young mothers decide to go home to their own mothers. When they telephone me after they have arrived home, they are surprised when I say they have to return to where they came from with the child. I have to explain to them that, under international law, they have to go back. They may be able to return home again with the child, with the agreement of the father, but this may not be possible. Much more public discussion is required about this matter. Many young people who marry outside their own culture cannot understand why they cannot return to this country with their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">We will have to come to terms with the fact that certain countries have not signed The Hague Convention. When children reach the age of seven or eight, the rights of both parents may be quite different in religious courts in such countries. The imam of one of the mosques in Dublin spoke at a conference I organised in Dublin for the legal profession. The imam, who was a very nice man, argued that people from other countries living in Ireland should be required to obey Irish law. I am not sure that his belief is very prevalent when it comes to the rearing of children. I have discovered that trouble begins to appear around the time when children in our culture make their first holy communion.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I have to confess that I think this problem will become even bigger. That is not meant even as a mildly racist comment – I simply wish to recognise the reality that we may be dealing with these problems far more often. The President of the European Parliament decided to appoint a mediator in 1994 after hundreds of women from Belgium and France walked across Europe to the European Parliament to bring to the President's attention the fact that hundreds of children were removed from these jurisdictions, mainly to north Africa. The women could not see their children. It was decided at that time that the problem needed to be examined and addressed in the best way possible. We needed to inform ourselves, as best we could, about the issues of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">I have reached the end of my allotted time. I will be happy to answer questions. I reiterate that I am delighted to be here. It has been a real privilege to address the House. I thank Senators for organising this debate.</p>

Having examined the details of Ms Banotti's workload since 1984, I have to compliment her for the manner in which she has conducted her role. She has always given the impression of doing her job in a dignified and unpolitical way, which is handsome in this age. I hope that more people will adopt such a way of thinking.</p>

          <p eId="para_357">It is particularly appropriate in the area of child abduction, in which Ms Banotti made her name, as well as health care, homelessness and the recognition of professional qualifications. I am not sure how Ms Banotti finds time to set her mind to all of these different areas, which require a great deal of research. I know she is very much still alive and I hope the word "retirement" will not enter her vocabulary. I do not like the word, which should be removed from the dictionary. Although Ms Banotti does not intend to run for the European Parliament again, I hope she will remain active.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Ms Banotti described the area of child abduction beautifully, particularly when she mentioned how easy it is for one to become trapped. She could have a huge role in deciding how best to make this country's educational system work. The problem of child abduction is faced by many people.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I have always been concerned by the fact that although a great deal of work is being done at EU level, we do not seem to be able to make a connection with citizens. I hope Ms Banotti will comment on this matter. As the Convention on the Future of Europe and the enlargement process proceed, can Ms Banotti see a way of making improvements in this regard? We are trying to make improvements, for example by giving more powers to the Joint Committee on European Affairs, by having many debates on the future of Europe in this House and by attending the Forum on Europe. We do not seem to be able to make the link, however. I blame the media for this. We have to make improvements. Perhaps next year's European elections will give a huge thrust to the debate. I would like Ms Banotti's views on this matter. I thank her for attending this debate and I wish her well in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I welcome Ms Mary Banotti to the House. In particular, I welcome a distinguished former Minister for Justice, Mrs. Nora Owen, and other members of Ms Banotti's family to the Visitors Gallery. I will not make a lengthy statement because many Senators wish to ask questions. It has been a privilege for the Fine Gael Party to have been represented in the European Parliament for the last 19 years by such an energetic champion of so many social issues. Her departure from the European Parliament after next year's European elections will be a great loss to the people of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I would like to ask Ms Banotti a question that I have wanted to put to a Member of the European Parliament since the publication of the Convention on the Future of Europe's proposals for an EU constitution. The Seanad has 60 Members and the other House has 166 Members, but there are 420 MEPs at present, a figure that will rise to over 600 after the accession states join the European Union. What are the challenges for MEPs who represent the regions of Europe in such a huge parliamentary structure? Based on her knowledge of matters in Brussels, can Ms Banotti tell the House what is the view of ordinary MEPs in respect of the consensus arrived at in the Convention on the Future of Europe? Does she feel that sufficient powers will reside at the European Parliament if this constitutional framework and institutional structure is put in place? I refer in particular to the fact that the Parliament will have the sole right, for the first time, to accept or reject a person nominated by the Council to be the President of the Commission. I think that and other powers are welcome, but can Ms Banotti give Senators her opinion about the standing of the report of the convention among her European Parliament colleagues?</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_364">As all Senators have to declare their interests when they speak in the House, I must do so now. I walk along the South Wall in Dublin with Ms Mary Banotti most Sunday mornings. We settle all EU matters as part of our conversations. I am to blame, therefore, for some of the problems in which she has been involved. I thought it was interesting when Ms Banotti mentioned that although there are 19 committees, Irish MEPs were initially involved mainly with the agriculture committee. She was involved with the environment committee. It is considerably difficult for the smaller countries to ensure they can spread their MEPs over all the committees. The big countries have far more MEPs, but Ireland will now have fewer. Ms Banotti is right in saying that whenever things have gone wrong, it has been useful to be able to blame Europe, such as the problem pertaining to the caper jar, but we have improved matters by having a committee to scrutinise European legislation. It was decided to establish it following an address by a Dane to the National Forum on Europe, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes. However, there continues to be appalling difficulties in getting support for research.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">I am a member of the Committee on Health and Children. Some days ago an innocuous directive was introduced stating that certain medical devices were acceptable. A few weeks beforehand, I read in a medical journal about medical devices that, unfortunately, had been found to promote infection. How can we, as a committee, possibly state that we suppose this is all right? Has Ms Banotti any comments on how we could try to have better research support when considering directives? Directives come in thick and fast, especially to some committees, and we do not want to sign off on them unless we are satisfied.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">A recent directive stated that chillis must not be polluted with Sudan red. I did not know whether Sudan red was good for one or whether chillis should contain it. Such directives come before us and we have a difficult time trying to sign off on them. What recommendations can Ms Banotti make as to how we can get more support?</p>

          <p eId="para_367">Cuirim fáilte roimh Ms Banotti, Comhalta de Pharlaimint na hEorpa. Senator Henry talked about her Sunday morning walks. I remember being on holidays one August in the wilds of west Kerry and discovered that, in the house next door, a certain MEP was assiduously practising her Irish for a few weeks. One meets Ms Banotti in the strangest of places.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">We saw Ms Banotti earlier today and I tried to remember for how long she has been an MEP. It is some compliment that, at the end of her current term in office, she will have been one for 20 years. How has she seen perspectives on Ireland evolve while she was an MEP, having regard to her comment on the huge rush to join the committee on agriculture 20 years ago? How does the average MEP regard Ireland today? I am not only interested in the Celtic tiger in this respect; I am especially interested to hear what MEPs regard as not so good about Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">What elements of the European constitution are MEPs unhappy with? I am not trying to be awkward in asking this. We get such a diet from the neighbouring island, which is based on a slightly medieval view of the world, that it is much more interesting to hear what those who have totally accepted the concept of European integration regard to be the deficits.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">What does Ms Banotti regard to be the remaining area or areas of the democratic deficit in the European project? This concerns us in Ireland, particularly since the shock of the first referendum on the Nice Treaty. It affects the way in which we advance the important European project and enable people to see why it matters.</p>

It is also a pleasure to see such a distinguished former Minister as Nora Owen in the Visitors Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">My question arises from the changes in powers and scope for the European Parliament envisaged under the convention, which I hope will take place. The problem, as EM Forster said, is a case of, "Only connect". How will a smaller number of MEPs connect with a constituency in Ireland and cover all the issues? Does Ms Banotti see any utility in their being consistent debates on European issues in this Chamber that would provide MEPs with some sort of sounding board for their activities?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Ms Banotti, MEP</from>
          <p eId="para_375">I thank the Senators. I am thrilled to be here and am most grateful for the kind remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Several of the Senators' questions overlap a little. I was shocked by the standard of debate during the first referendum on the Nice treaty. While my generation – most people present are probably younger than me – has a certain memory of Ireland and of Europe, I realise that anybody under the age of about 40 has a totally different set of memories about the world in which we live. When I was growing up, the biggest charity in Dublin was the <i>Evening Herald</i> boot fund, the purpose of which was to collect money so children could have shoes. If I mention something like this to my daughter she laughs at me. She does not believe me and thinks I am getting old and sentimental. Therefore, we have to argue the case for Europe every ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">It is easy for me to hold my perspective because I have colleagues who remember the Second World War and who remember rooting in dustbins for food while it was taking place. Helmut Kohl has touched on this very well in terms of his passion for the European Union and his desire that it be supported, particularly because of the traumas experienced by his country. His attitude was still prevalent when I joined the European Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">When I joined there were less than 400 MEPs because three member states joined later. I marvelled at the size of that European Parliament in comparison to our national Parliament. However, I now regard it as having been a dinky little Parliament in which we knew everybody. It is very different today. There are 628 MEPs and there will be even more when the new member states join.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">There are representatives of the applicant countries in the European Parliament in an observer capacity. They do not seem to be making a huge amount of connection with the Parliament. A Latvian representative wrote an article which the lads back home did not like too well. They suddenly decided that they would take the representative back to Latvia as a result. We are now facing a constitutional issue because we will fight tooth and nail over this. While one may not like or agree with what somebody is saying, one would die for their right to say it. We are already encountering interesting issues such as this where a member of a democratic institution, in which members are used to having disagreements, can be replaced by someone who is more in line with thinking in his or her parliament back home. The outcome of this case will be interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I have noticed the new members from the accession countries are relatively old, which suggests they were politically active during the years when their countries were under a totalitarian regime. Without wishing to make a party political point, it is also interesting to note how conservative they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The European Parliament will be very different after enlargement and will take time to settle down. I paid some interesting visits to the accession countries, including, for example, Poland which I visited for the first time last September when we examined a number of issues. I also met a very charismatic politician, Mr. Andrzej Lepper, the Jean-Marie Le Pen of Poland, who attached himself to a particular political view as soon as he entered the European Parliament. We do not have an equivalent to Mr. Lepper or Monsieur Le Pen. Some of these politicians whose views appal one are extremely charismatic and speak excellently. I am afraid that having learned how to communicate so effectively, their point of view will gain precedence in their home countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Senator Brian Hayes asked about the powers of the European Parliament, which I have observed since being elected to it. I remember attending committee meetings where we sat around discussing at inordinate length legislation over which we had no influence – it made us feel good to do so. One would receive a list of up to 400 amendments proposing to change all sorts of minor details such as semi-colons. At the end of the process, one ended up with what I used to describe as a political string vest in that the legislation was full of holes and one did not know for what one was voting.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">By passing the referendum on the Single European Act, boredom inducing legislation of such staggering complexity that it is little wonder nobody understood it, we introduced a system which has made the lives of MEPs considerably easier. For example, qualified majority voting was introduced for various issues, which meant that if we did not achieve a qualified majority – about 334 votes – the legislation in question would not be passed. As a result, MEPs had to get serious and make up their minds on whether they wanted legislation to be passed. As we had to stop messing around with useless, ego-boosting amendments, it perked us up considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The powers of the European Parliament have increased exponentially since the enactment of the Single European Act and it has become a much more organised and professional parliament. Every step has been taken slowly and carefully. Nothing came easily or without a fight because the Council and Commission are not anxious to cede power.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The document produced by the Convention, which affects all of us regardless of what we are working on, is widely regarded as significant and brave and I am happy to support it. All legislation in the European Parliament is passed by consensus. Essentially, it is a consensus parliament, which means one does not often have wonderful days such as yesterday's sitting of the Dáil. We were delighted with Mr. Berlusconi's appearance in the European Parliament because he gave us a really good row on the floor of the Chamber, of which there are not too many. Regardless of their views on Mr. Berlusconi, all MEPs enjoyed his visit. The European Parliament does not have the same cut and thrust one finds in national parliaments.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">MEPs do their work primarily in committee, which is where the real political debate takes place, particularly on major issues affecting all member states such as immigration and asylum. I confess that immigration was minimal when we first started to consider legislation on issues of this nature, to the extent that if one saw a foreigner who was not on holiday, one wondered what he or she was doing here. I felt slightly uncomfortable, therefore, taking a political position on asylum and immigration issues because many of my colleagues were from countries into which hundreds of thousands of immigrants and asylum seekers were crossing. They faced completely different circumstances from Irish MEPs. The position regarding immigration has now dramatically changed. It used to be easy when one did not have to deal with this kind of issues in the sense that, as with all legislation, it is fine provided one does not have to implement it oneself.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The impact of immigration and asylum differs among the member states. Austria, for example, a small country which borders the accession countries is the first stop for a significant number of people entering the European Union from eastern Europe. For this reason, it is a massive political issue in the country and, given the numbers involved, an important economic question also.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Apropos of committees, Senator Henry is correct that it is difficult for a small country to have a good spread of MEPs across committees. Many of the countries with electoral systems based on lists of candidates include on their list a competent man or woman in each field, for instance, education, transport and economics, to ensure they have someone elected who is politically safe and knows what he or she is talking about. They can then be appointed on the various committees. This is not the case in smaller countries but, nevertheless, Irish MEPs are much better spread around the committees than they were in the past. We work closely together and the various parties do not attack each other politically. If issues of particular concern and interest to Ireland arise, most of us vote along the same lines. We do not try to trip each other up on issues, which is important. I enjoy this and like the idea that one can be friends with people from other political parties while also having differences.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">On Senator Ryan's question on the perspective on Ireland in the European Parliament, it was obvious when I entered the Parliament that our officials were brilliant at corridor networking. Ireland was too small to be considered a danger by other countries and we were universally liked because we were cute and nice to everybody and did not take strong political positions on anything. Other nationalities enjoyed our company and, being Irish, we used and continue to use this to our maximum advantage. The view of Ireland was, therefore, that the people were nice – a bit of gas – and the country was lovely and green.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Things began to change, however, when our economy made such a spectacular turnaround. At that point, people were pleased for us in the same way as a mother is pleased for a child who has just attained good results in school exams. At the same time, we could no longer play the role of being a poor, small island which could ask for money and keep quiet. We had to recognise that we had moved into a different league. Colleagues from other countries, particularly applicant countries, are interested in talking to us about how we did it. Senators will notice that a huge number of Irish consultants work in many of these countries, advising them on how we did it and how they can do it. We have had to grow up and, in that context, things have changed slightly. However, it is not unpleasant.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Everybody is aware of the cut and thrust that was involved in getting the final document from the convention. Some will jump up and down and find something wrong with it; indeed, everybody will find something wrong with it. However, it is important that it comes into force, if only for practical reasons. Several Senators were kind enough to refer to the amount of legislation I have been involved with in the last 19 years. There have been massive amounts of legislation, some of it so technical that I have regularly asked myself how a bunch of politicians, who know nothing about some of these highly technical matters, can possibly deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I remember the first time I went to the environment and consumer protection committee. Somebody told me I was in charge of the chocolate directive. I replied that the more than 40,000 people who sent me to Brussels did not send me there to talk about chocolate. I was there to change the world. I remember standing there and wondering what I should do with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_394">I turned to a more experienced colleague, Hanja Maij-weggen, a famous Dutch politician who is also retiring, and asked her what to do about the chocolate directive. She gave me the best political advice ever, that I had to find the political point.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I wondered what was the political point of a bar of chocolate. I was very inexperienced so I did the only thing I could, which was to ring Cadburys in Coolock. I asked the girl who answered the phone if anybody there knew anything about a directive. She put me through to the office upstairs and I repeated the question. The person who answered the phone told me: "There is a man here who thinks about nothing else but the chocolate directive". I knew I was onto a winner so I made an appointment to see him. I drove out to Cadburys in Coolock and fulfilled another lifetime dream. I spent the day in a chocolate factory. I watched the Milky Way bars go past on conveyor belts. I realised that Ireland is the Flake capital of the world. I saw cement mixers full of Smarties of all colours, which reminds me that there is another directive on colourings. I had the best time and came home loaded with free samples, something everybody hopes to get when they visit a chocolate factory.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I returned to Brussels and discovered that the British and the Irish make their chocolate in the same way so I knew I had some allies there. However, the main rapporteur on that report was a man called Mr. Nordmann, who lived next door to the biggest, best and most expensive chocolate factory in France. While I was getting my briefing from Cadburys he was getting his briefing from this factory, which wanted nothing more than to ensure that only chocolate made in the same way as it was made in this factory could be labelled as chocolate.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I arrived at the committee weighed down with free bars of Cadburys Fruit and Nut for every member. They thought it was my birthday and that I was celebrating it by giving them a free bar of chocolate. I met Mr. Nordmann in the corridor and I had a particularly big bar of Fruit and Nut for him. However, he stood with his hand held up in refusal and said: "A piece of that chocolate will never cross my lips until this debate is over". I thought it was hilarious. However, the next group to arrive was the development committee. Chocolate is a major issue for some of the west African countries because cocoa butter is one of their main exports. We therefore found ourselves dealing with an industrial issue, a consumer issue and a development issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I have always been grateful for the chocolate directive which, incidentally, still has not been solved. We dealt with it through a labelling device which would show how much cocoa butter was in a bar of chocolate and left it at that. The issue ran for a long time but it was a great political learning process for me. What confuses people is how an issue in which one has an interest or about which one has a concern can be affected by other issues, be they economic, consumer protection, environmental or so forth. One needs to keep a careful eye on such things and that is what we tried to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">No matter how important or complex the legislation, the public understanding of it is generally brought down to the most simple issue or to the one thing that will get members of the public outside the gates of parliament abusing politicians. It generally has nothing to do with the legislation as a whole. The children in the schools love my chocolate story and I talk to them about it because they are extremely interested in chocolate. However, I also hope it is a context to explain these things. I am sure Senators find, in the course of their work, that where a political issue is controversial, most people will only confront them about one part or aspect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The issue of stem cell research is a topical example. It is a controversial and anguishing issue. I heard Deputy Gay Mitchell speaking on the radio about it this morning. He made the justifiable point that it was not discussed in the Committee on European Affairs. He is right to be annoyed about it. I suppose I can be braver in what I say because I am not running again for election but when dealing with issues such as this, I have suffered as a politician over the years from the type of black and white debates they always generate.</p>

          <p eId="para_404">Exactly. My mother had Parkinson's disease. She lived with it for about nine years before she died. I am a nurse and have seen how that disease develops. Naturally, I do not want to kill babies or anything else. This is a highly complex, technical issue. I can understand the moral issues involved and I am touched by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">One of the most moving moments I experienced in the past year in the European Parliament involved a colleague I have known for many years, Nicholas Bethell, a distinguished Member of the European Parliament. A similar type of debate on this issue was taking place within my political group and everybody was up on their high horse, taking the high moral ground on this and that. Nicholas Bethell put his hand up. He is dying of Parkinson's disease and left the parliament about a month ago. He spoke quietly and calmly about having advanced Parkinson's disease. He said his father had died from Parkinson's disease and that his eight year old son was just as likely to get this dreadful disease, given the genetic issues involved. He said he was leaving the Parliament, but he wanted people to think hard when trying to simplify such issues. Having listened to some of the debate, I have decided to vote in favour of it in memory of my mother and of him. I have great respect for people with other points of view. However, I will vote for it because I believe some good can come from it.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_418">This matter relates to the Christian Brothers national school in New Ross in County Wexford. Before the last local and general elections, funds were promised by Government candidates for the development of a new school building. The original school building is still in use, but I am not sure how old it is. I was in contact recently with a number of teachers at the school who told me there is a serious possibility that the windows could fall in on top of students over the winter months. People who are familiar with New Ross know that it lies on the banks of the River Barrow. I would like to know if the Department has made any progress towards providing a new building for the Christian Brothers' national school in New Ross.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesMcDaid" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_216">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</from>
          <p eId="para_419">I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, the current position on the construction of a new school building for the Christian Brothers national school in New Ross in County Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">In 2001, the board of management of the Christian Brothers school in New Ross submitted an application to the Department of Education and Science for additional accommodation and the upgrading of existing accommodation. This application was referred to the Department's planning section to determine the school's enrolment trends. Since the enrolment trends at both primary and post-primary schools in the New Ross area generally were declining, the Department of Education and Science initiated a review of the educational provision in the area. In view of the extent of this review, Dr. Tom McCarthy was appointed as a facilitator to consult with the local providers and to identify the key issues in primary and post-primary school provision in the area. His report is currently under consideration in the Department and his recommendations will assist in finalising the optimum strategy for educational provision in New Ross into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The Minister does not, however, intend to move unilaterally on this matter. The scale of change potentially involved means that it is right and proper that all the schools' trustees are consulted and that discussions should also involve both Kilkenny County Council and New Ross Urban District Council. Discussions with the latter parties, in particular, are necessary to ensure the greatest possible clarity regarding demographic changes and housing formation in the area that will inevitably impact on educational provision. While discussions have already taken place with both the trustees and the local authority officials, further dialogue is necessary before finalising the likely future shape of educational provision in New Ross.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Consistent with normal practice, the Department will not proceed with capital funding at any school in the area pending finalisation of the optimum strategy for the area. Consequently, a decision on the construction of a new school building for the Christian Brothers' school in New Ross will not be taken until such time as all the necessary discussions have been finalised. I heard the Senator's comments about the school's windows. The school's authority should, as appropriate, use its devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works that may arise at the school.</p>

          <from>Mr. Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_423">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss this matter which relates to the Holy Family national school in Tubbercurry, County Sligo. There are six classrooms in the school, one of which is divided in two. It has ten teachers and five classroom assistants. There are also part-time teachers who teach in the school at different times. There are ten special needs children in the school who do not have any accommodation. Their classes are taught in the hallway. There are six non-nationals and 12 Travellers on the register. There is a total of 131 children at the school. The school is 55% disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I spoke to the principal this morning and she told me they have been looking for a new school since 1972. It is currently at stage six planning in the Department. They were at that stage in 1985, so I do not know what has happened since then. I cannot explain in detail the problems in this school. Some days there are 17 staff, but there is only one staff toilet. These people are working in very confined conditions. The INTO has taken an interest in this school and is one of the issues over which its members might go on strike because of the length of time the school has had these problems and the conditions in which some of the children are being taught. They are using cloakrooms as classrooms. I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that this school, whose conditions must be among the worst in the country for staff and students, receives the attention it needs early in the new year.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesMcDaid" eId="spk_218" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport">
          <from>Dr. McDaid</from>
          <p eId="para_425">I thank Senator Scanlon for raising this matter. He explained that the school in question applied for a new building in 1972, that in 1985 the project was at its current stage in the school building programme and that the school has six classrooms, 131 children, some of whom have various problems, and 15 staff. I am glad to have an opportunity of outlining to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science on the allocation of funding for school building projects in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The 2003 school building programme is on the Department's website and is designed to give the maximum amount of information concerning the school's capital investment programme to managers, boards of management, principals, parents, students and all other interested parties. The criteria used for selecting projects were also published for the first time. I am sure the Senator and the school management are aware of this. The large-scale building project for Holy Family national school, Tubbercurry, is listed in section 6 of the 2003 school building programme. This project is at stage 4-5, or pre-tender documentation stage, of architectural planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progression to tender and construction of these projects, including the school in question, in conjunction with the band rating individually assigned. I understand, however, that in view of the conditions that pertain at the school it is being given urgent priority. Management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety matters.</p>
