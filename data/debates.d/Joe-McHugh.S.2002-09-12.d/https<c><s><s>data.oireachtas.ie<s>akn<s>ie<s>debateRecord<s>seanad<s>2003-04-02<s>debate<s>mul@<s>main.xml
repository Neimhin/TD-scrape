        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Order of Business is No. 1, Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2003 – Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, to conclude not later than 1 p.m.; No. 2, Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2002 – Committee Stage, to be taken at 2 p.m. and conclude not later than 4 p.m.; No. 3, statements on the humanitarian consequences of the war in Iraq, to be taken from 4 p.m. until 6 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; and No. 12, motion No. 27, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">I am aware that a great number of Senators may wish to contribute to the statements and perhaps the Whips could have a quick meeting after the Order of Business to see how to divide up the time. We had sought with the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has agreed to come in, to take statements at 3.30 p.m., which would give us two and a half hours. While there are some amendments to the Central Bank Bill to be discussed, they might not take two hours. We are still pursuing that, but I will speak to the Whips after the Order of Business.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_3">We agree to the Order of Business. I thank the Leader for organising the debate on Iraq this afternoon from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and for arranging to have the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, in the House for that debate. Yesterday she took up a suggestion, first made by Senator O'Toole, that the House should look at possibly sending a delegation to Iraq to report on the situation in a free and open way. She said she would take it up with the relevant Minister and the Government. Is there any news on that front?</p>
          <p eId="para_4">I wish to make a suggestion to the Leader in an effort to be helpful. She is aware that very important discussions will take place next week, on 10 April, between the heads of both Governments, the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, in respect of Northern Ireland. I also understand that the blueprint on which both Governments have been working is likely to be published next week. Does the Leader believe it would be useful to have a debate next week in the House following the publication of the blueprint, which will clearly be in the public domain and on which people will be commenting? While I do not want in any way to provide a difficulty for the Government, the House should look at the blueprint once it is published and give a view on the matter. I put that suggestion to her in a bipartisan way.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">The Leader might find out from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment why a Bill, which arises from an EU directive, supposed to be transposed into Irish law by this year to allow specific rights to part-time workers, has yet to be published and put through both Houses of the Oireachtas. In January the Government said this Bill was a priority. The Bill simply puts into place a range of European directive rights for our workers, giving them permanent rights of employment where they are on fixed-term contracts. It would also be a significant help to those people from outside this country who are working here, some of whom are being treated abominably. We saw the case in the newspapers earlier this week of the Ukrainian people who have been treated very shabbily indeed. We need this legislation in place. The Leader might find out when it is likely to be published and put through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_6">I thank the Leader for arranging this debate on Iraq which is important, particularly in the light of the news overnight of further very significant civilian casualties, including children. I am very grateful that we are having this debate also because of the comments of British soldiers that the American pilots who shot them up were "cowboys out on a jolly".</p>
          <p eId="para_7">In that context, I want to ask the Minister a specific question. I recognise that my language is not always diplomatic and I am expressing this very carefully. I ask the Leader if she would request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to call in the ambassadors of the United Kingdom and the United States to express our concern at the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium shells, the results of which I have seen in the hospitals in Baghdad.</p>

          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_8">These are matters which the Senator could raise during the statements later today.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_9">This is a specific request to the Leader that she should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take this action and I have couched it in very mild and moderate terms, especially in the light of the fact that the film taken by the cameraman is apparently so unspeakable that it cannot be shown on television.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_10">A Chathaoirligh, while I do not want to incur your wrath, I sympathise entirely with Senator Norris's feelings. However, we can talk about it this afternoon. While I did suggest 15 minutes for spokespersons, I am not sure whether spokespersons should have any more time than others in this debate.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_7">

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_13">Ten minutes all around is better. Many have strong feelings on the issue. I have moved beyond beating Members on the other side of the House over the head about it because it is far too serious an issue to be discussed in that manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday contained comments from Ms Justice Laffoy that there had been “no real engagement by the Department of Education and Science with the Commission of Inquiry into Child Abuse.” I find this entirely astonishing. The Minister for Education and Science should be accountable to one or other House of the Oireachtas. How can it be that Ms Justice Laffoy is forced to say this in public? I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come here some time this week or next week to explain the reason the Department has had “no real engagement” with a commission of inquiry. We are all concerned about how long inquiries seem to take but the Department is central to an inquiry which is in many ways probing into matters infinitely more sensitive than the issues getting so much publicity in Dublin Castle. If it is hindering the work of the inquiry through incompetence or worse, the Houses of the Oireachtas, through which the inquiry was set up, are entitled to know the reason. I request that the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to issue a statement or come into the House to explain.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">At the last count, 15 Bills passed in this House are before the other House. We seem to be able to do our business efficiently.

These are still on the Dáil Order Paper, although we were expected to rush them through – before Christmas, in the case of the Immigration Bill 2002. Another Bill, utterly relevant to the current climate, was passed by this House in 2000 – the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill which was supposed to be our contribution to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. A major war is now ongoing because of an attempt to get around this. The least we can do to show that we are serious about the issues raised by the war is to pass this Bill which has been on the Dáil Order Paper for the best part of three years. It is time something was done about it.</p>

Perhaps the Minister of State will also provide us with an update on this.

          <p eId="para_30">I support Senator Brian Hayes's request for a debate on Northern Ireland which would be timely, although whether it will still be timely next week is another matter. The blueprint mentioned by the Senator will be published next Thursday and the Leader might guarantee us a debate, perhaps the following Tuesday. It is not a question of avoiding a Friday sitting but of allowing time to see the reactions of the various parties, particularly those in Northern Ireland, in order that the House can have a broader view. It might be interesting to reflect on and respond to the reactions of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">Senator Ryan mentioned the comments of Ms Justice Laffoy about the Department of Education and Science. I, too, was shocked that the Department was not co-operating with the Laffoy commission to the extent the judge expected. I read in today's newspapers that the Cabinet finds itself unable to support the case of Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin on the grounds that it would undermine the tribunal it had set up. I am not sure that it would be undermining the tribunal to help it clarify its legal powers and ambit. This is of importance because it is a conflict of interest between two institutions and should be dealt with. If there is no public money to do this, we, as Members of the Oireachtas, should in some way ensure these two Members are not left on their own to deal with it.</p>

He said very clearly that he did not think it was a good idea to spend a great deal of money on arms. Will the Leader convey a message to the Taoiseach that we all support that view and that he should do everything he can to deter those leaders of other European countries who want to set up such an army?</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Perhaps the Leader will send a message from the House to all those incredibly courageous reporters, cameramen and other journalists from the Irish media who are giving us such excellent reporting from Iraq. We are extraordinarily fortunate in being able to get such balanced reporting. Friends of mine visiting from America cannot believe the difference between the reporting in the Irish media and that in the American media. It is no wonder the war has 89% support, particularly when one bears in mind what is being broadcast on television – the medium from which most people there obtain their news.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">In recent years we enacted legislation to ensure that buildings of historical significance in different parts of the country would be respected and not demolished. That legislation was introduced as a result of hundreds of buildings being demolished in different areas, including the P. J. McCall house in Wexford, the de Valera cottage in the Nire Valley and many more. I am astounded to hear that 16 Moore Street is to be demolished. This building was the last headquarters of the 1916 leaders, where they met to discuss surrender in order to ensure the citizens of Dublin would not suffer any further. It is interesting that one official does not regard it as being of historical significance. The National Graves Association says it is particularly significant in Ireland's history and in America it would be the equivalent of the Alamo. I ask the Leader to take up this matter urgently with the appropriate Minister in order to ensure that 16 Moore Street will not, under any circumstances, be interfered with.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I call on the Leader to request the Minister for Agriculture and Food to personally intervene in the current difficulties within his Department where clerical personnel yesterday received notice by e-mail that they had been taken off the payroll. If industrial relations within Departments have descended to that level, there will be serious consequences. Many farmers have great difficulty communicating their problems and this is stifling progress in respect of many applications and the movement of animals, including some with diseases. Certain individuals have been waiting two years for a response to their claims from the Department officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I read in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that one individual received approximately €1.6 million for the provision of bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless people in Dublin. That equates to approximately €160 per bed per night. The Minister with responsibility for housing should come before the House as a matter of urgency to discuss this matter. The fact that the agency provides such funding to one individual indicates that something is seriously wrong and that the response to the needs of the homeless is out of control.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">I again ask the Leader to allow statements on the Irish language in view of the fact that a recent survey has shown there is a decline of use of the language even in Gaeltacht areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">It is regrettable that we continue to read in the newspapers and hear on radio and television of continuing knife attacks throughout the State.

This debate should include the views expressed in an article in the current issue of <i>Public Affairs Ireland</i> by Mr. Justice Smith on related matters. It is disturbing to learn from that article that Ireland is now ranked 23rd in the corruption index, behind Chile and Hong Kong. As this touches on the overall issue of tribunals and their outflow, it should form part of the debate.</p>

Any of us could face such a situation in the future. This decision is shocking, particularly when one bears in mind that they decided to give the information to the Minister privately and not raise it in the House. If they had raised it in the Dáil, they would have been covered by the privilege thereof. It is horrifying it has come to this and I hope some mechanism is found to ensure that they are legally protected in terms of whatever expenditure is involved. This is an important issue for both Houses. I hope to talk to my Fianna Fáil colleagues afterwards to find out how it feels to be infected by the genes of the Progressive Democrats.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">I endorse what was said by Senators Glynn and Ó Murchú about 16 Moore Street. It would be a travesty if that building were demolished. It should be preserved because it is obviously of historic importance. While it might seem early, we should be planning now for the centenary commemoration of 1916. I hope we will not have such an anaemic event as that which took place in 1991 on the occasion of the 75th anniversary.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">I previously asked the Leader for a debate on insurance. On that occasion a number of Members broadened it beyond what I sought, which was a debate on liability insurance. I ask the Leader to have a debate at an early stage confined to this issue. Many companies are operating without insurance and this makes matters difficult for employers and employees. The compensation culture that exists in this country needs to be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">I welcome the recently published report by the Law Reform Commission which takes to task the cost of the tribunals. There was a suggestion, which echoed a comment I made when previously asking for an insurance debate, that we could move to an inquisitorial arrangement rather than using the advocacy model. The report questions the correctness and necessity of legal representation for people brought before tribunals. I ask the Leader to examine the report and consider whether it might form the basis for a good debate. In the context of the report, a suggestion was made yesterday that one of the tribunals could last for another 20 years. Regardless of the importance of the tribunal's work, that would be an appalling imposition on taxpayers and the prospect should be examined carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">A number of Senators have called for the case that will be taken by Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin to be funded. Co-operation with tribunals is an issue to which we must give serious consideration and, therefore, we should not call for financial support for this case without looking at it thoroughly. I was surprised by the line the Committee on Procedure and Privileges took on that matter. The principle involved is important, but the issue of Members of the Oireachtas co-operating with tribunals is an entirely different matter.</p>

A more general principle is involved, namely, a requirement that some kind of certification be provided by an appropriate body regarding those buildings which are historic and those which are not. These matters should not be left to the casual decision of an official who may or may not be historically aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">In response to Senator Bannon, we are correct to keep regional disparities under close review. The information to which he referred was published ten days ago in one of the CSO's bulletins, so freedom of information issues do not arise in that case. Counties one might not expect – such as south Tipperary and Wexford – also fall into the same categories as the parts of the country to which he refers. People need to realise that the traditional disparities have shifted somewhat.</p>

Some of the 15 countries participating include Spain, France, Germany and Italy. The community-led event, which came to my attention only recently, has been aided by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Will the Leader inform the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism about the competition and ask some of his officials to contact the group in Downings? This is a good example of a community-led tourism project which could form a prototype that we should encourage and promote as we look for more sustainable tourism products.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">Senator Brian Hayes asked about the proposed delegation to Iraq. I made a cursory inquiry yesterday and was told unofficially that as Iraq is a war zone, the Department of Foreign Affairs advises people not to travel there. However, I will make a more official inquiry today.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Senators Brian and Maurice Hayes also raised the issue of the Northern Ireland talks blueprint, which is due to be published on 10 April, and requested a debate on the matter. On the basis of what the Senators said, it would be useful to have such a debate on Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week, which is the last week before the Easter recess. Senators would, at that stage, be informed by comment on the document which will be made over the preceding weekend. It is important we keep up to date with what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">Senator Brian Hayes also asked when legislation governing specific rights for part-time workers will be brought before the House, following the adoption of the EU directive, and I will make inquiries about it. Senator Norris asked that the Minister for Foreign Affairs be requested to call the UK and US ambassadors before him. I will communicate that to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Senators Ryan and Maurice Hayes referred to Ms Justice Laffoy's statement that there had been no real engagement between the Department of Education and Science and the Commission of Inquiry into Child Abuse. If this is correct – one must accept that it is – it justifies a strong query as to why this was the case. Often a case of non-communication can turn out to signify something else when it is investigated. I will follow up on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Senator Ryan also referred to Bills which are being delayed in the Dáil and asked if I would speak to the Taoiseach in that context. I would be delighted to speak to the Taoiseach, but I rather expect to speak to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, instead. The previous Seanad cannot be blamed for what happened in 2000 to the Bill to which the Senator refers and which is listed on page 360 of the Order Paper each day. We must discover why it has not been dealt with since 2000. I understand that Deputy Hanafin is concerned about delays in respect of some other Bills and is working to have them dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Senator Ormonde asked if the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, would come before the House to update Senators on events in Europe. No more than any other issue, it is important to have regular updates and we could use the House for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">Senator Bannon asked about the Local Government (No. 2) Bill. The Bill was due to be published today but I do not know whether it has emerged. It refers to a bridge in Waterford which, because the Local Government Act 1946 is deficient in one respect, cannot proceed for some reason. I will report to the Senator or Senator Brian Hayes on the matter during the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Senator Henry called on the Taoiseach not to spend any more money on arms and supported the Irish media's reporting of the war in Iraq. This has been a recurring theme in the House when Members speak about the war. At least when one tunes in to RTE, one feels that one is getting the full story, warts and all, whereas other broadcasters produce sanitised versions, some of them outrageously so. The voices are reassuring to us because we feel we are learning about what is going on. I telephoned the man in charge of news and told him there was general support in the House for the way the Irish media are dealing with the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">Senators Ó Murchú and Glynn referred to the alarming proposed demolition of 16 Moore Street. I recall – Senator Dardis reaffirmed – that every local authority must have a list of historic buildings which it aims to keep in shape. We should contact Dublin City Council in this context. It would be dreadful if the building was allowed to be demolished and it would be against all our sensibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Senator Ulick Burke asked if the Minister for Agriculture and Food would intervene in the Civil Service dispute. He also referred to the amount of money –€1.4 million – that is alleged to have been paid to one landlord for housing homeless people.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Senator Glynn requested a debate on the Irish language. A Bill on the Irish language is due to come before the House either next week or immediately after Easter and it will offer an opportunity for a full debate. The Senator also asked again about knife attacks. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, will be in the Seanad tomorrow and the issue can be raised then. The Minister is keen to come to the House. It will be a full debate, for all of which he will be present. He will also deliver a major speech. The issues relating to crime which Senators have mentioned can be raised in the course of the debate.</p>

However, the Dáil and Seanad established the tribunals and, having done so, we must keep faith with them. The costs are another matter.

          <p eId="para_68">Senator White acclaimed the actions of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, with regard to the Freedom of Information Act and asked when he will return to the Seanad. He will return when the Bill is returned to the House before the recess.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_84">In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_85">2.–In so far as additional payments are made to the Local Government Fund by virtue of this Act which, but for this Act, would not be made, such payments shall be applied to the construction, repair and maintenance of tertiary roads.".</p>
          <p eId="para_86">This amendment proposes that a special fund be made available by the Department to enable local authorities to repair and improve tertiary roads. My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, made this suggestion in the Dáil during the debate on the Bill. There is a major problem with tertiary roads. In my local authority area roads leading into estates, particularly old roads, have deteriorated severely in recent years. The road into my estate is full of potholes; it is in an unbelievable state. Every now and then the county council has the holes filled but the repairs only last for a couple of months before the holes reappear. Substantial work has to be done on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">There are tertiary roads throughout the country and the councils do not seem to be able to repair them in a substantial way. There should be a special fund for that type of work. It would also reduce costs in the long term. If proper work was carried out now, the roads would not have to be reinstated in the future, which would be far more costly. Last year, as a result of Government cutbacks, the mid-year grant usually made available to local authorities and which could have been used for this work was not made available. The funding proposed in the amendment would be useful in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">People feel badly about this and other taxes. On the one hand, the Government makes much of reductions in income tax but motor tax is one of a number of charges that are not income related. They are hitting people hard. Motorists should be able to see that this money is being put to a use that will improve their quality of life. It should be put into the improvement of roads. Despite this 12% increase in motor taxation, the amount spent on roads is not increasing but reducing. The grant last year for non-national roads was €438 million. As the same amount has been allocated this year, there is no increase for inflation. Effectively, the amount is being reduced. Other allocations have been reduced. The budget for restoration, for example, has been reduced from €221 million to €216 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">Motorists will not understand the reason they are expected to fork out more money when road budgets are being reduced. If they are paying extra tax, they should see how that money is being spent. I suggest it could be used for tertiary roads, the condition of which is particularly bad.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_47">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_90">I second the amendment. The Bill paves the way for the Government to increase taxation for motor vehicles by 12%, way beyond the rate of inflation. The biggest culprit in causing inflation is the Government because most of the charges it has introduced are in excess of 5% or 6% and, thus, not keeping in line with inflation, even though it preaches that we have to stay within the boundaries of inflation. It has the cheek to tell us that the additional funding is for the local authority roads programme but, as Senator Tuffy and others have said, no extra money has been made available for roads. In fact, some €70 million has been taken out of the roads programme causing a huge shortfall.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">At least three roads have been dropped from the County Longford five year road development programme due to inadequate funding from the Department. It is anticipated that the increase in motor taxation will bring in approximately €65 million but there will still be a shortfall of around €5 million on the allocations to local authorities for 2003. We are told we will have to make up the shortfall of €70 million by increased motor taxation but the allocation for county roads has decreased considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">The Government is playing a game of three card trick, robbing Peter to pay Paul. We have been misled several times by it since it took office. We have seen increased motor taxation and other increases in order to prop up the mismanagement of "Charlie's economy". I would like to show the Minister of State some of the roads in my area of the midlands, which are in a dreadful condition. He would not risk bringing a State car along any of them because they are in such a poor state.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">We were conned by the first Charlie for several years and it now appears that the Minister of State is being conned by the second Charlie, the Minister for Finance, given the 12% increase in road tax. These taxes are being introduced by stealth and will hit everybody, including families, thus contributing to inflation which is out of control.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">The Bill contains no relief proposals for disabled drivers. The purchase relief tax is unfairly administered. I know of many deserving cases who cannot avail of it, despite suffering from disabilities.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_109">I have much sympathy with what Senator Tuffy said concerning tertiary roads. I am concerned, however, that if we were to confine the amendment to the construction, repair and maintenance of tertiary roads, we would be forgetting about many other non-national roads. I am thinking, in particular, of county and regional roads. The Minister of State's Department makes a contribution to the CLÁR programme, about which I spoke yesterday. That programme ensures repairs are carried out on roads that might otherwise not be maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">I appreciate that the local roads improvement scheme is not available in every part of the country but it is very important in County Galway as it is responsible for funding the repair of roads leading to bogland. There may not be any houses along these roads but there has to be some way for people to gain access to such farmland. It would be wrong to confine the amendment to tertiary roads when there are so many other types of route that require funding for repairs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_63">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_111">The amendment proposes to give primacy to tertiary roads in the context of extra revenue generated by the increases in motor tax set out in the Bill. I cannot accept it as to give statutory priority to a particular class of road such as tertiary roads would set a most unwelcome and inflexible precedent. Senator Tuffy, supported by Senator Bannon, is saying the €65 million should be spent on tertiary roads at the expense of regional and county roads. That is what is being suggested, although I am not suggesting for one moment that tertiary roads are unimportant. If this was to happen, perhaps Senators could indicate how local authorities would decide which roads would miss out on funding. It might be the popular thing to say but it would not be a realistic or practical thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">The non-national road effort is based on a holistic approach which is bringing about quantifiable improvement to the network. It is important to set the context by providing a breakdown of what is involved. Of the 87,150 km of non-national roads in county council areas, there are in excess of 11,000 km of regional roads, 23,600 km of local primary roads, 32,000 km of local secondary roads, and 20,000 km of local tertiary roads. The proposed amendment seeks to give absolute priority to the latter category which accounts for only 23% of the non-national road network.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The maintenance and improvement of non-national roads are matters for individual local authorities which submit multi-annual programmes to the Department. Far be it from me to advise Senators but if councillors, Senators or Deputies feel priority should be given to their respective local authority areas, I can only suggest that in exceptional circumstances they should have discussions with their local authority. The Department is prepared to consider positively any request from a county council to adjust the current 2002-05 multi-annual restoration programme to allow for the inclusion of one or more local tertiary roads in place of schemes already included in the programme. If local authorities are of the view that this should be done and if they make a case to the Department, we will be more than prepared to give positive consideration to any such request.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">Some 50% of the overall allocation goes to the restoration programme, which has been in place since 1995. It aims to restore all those regional local roads which were deficient in 1996 by the end of 2005. The programme was undertaken on foot of multi-annual restoration programmes prepared by county councils and submitted to the Department. If it is the wish of any local authority to have this amended in any way, we will be only too pleased to act as positively as we can. Local authorities are best placed to determine the priority to be accorded to their roads under these multi-annual programmes. The restoration programme has been a great success.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">Up to the end of 2002, nearly 30,000 kilometres of non-national roads were restored to good condition under the programme. Priority would have been accorded to regional roads and more heavily trafficked local primary roads up to now. Given the progress already achieved, it would be expected that further such programmes will be in a position to include much greater numbers of local secondary and local tertiary roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">A further pavement study will be carried out in 2003. The Department is finalising the terms of reference for this study and tenders will be sought shortly. The study will ascertain the extent of the remaining deficiencies in the network and will examine each class of road, including tertiary roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Section 13(2) of the Roads Act 1993 places a legal responsibility on local authorities for the maintenance and construction of regional and local roads in their areas. It would not be in the best interests of the road network to accept an amendment that would give priority to one type of road over others. This would be inflexible. It would interfere with the local democratic decision making process currently operated by local authorities. I would not wish to introduce any legislative rigidities or inflexibilities into the funding programme for non-national roads. We are accused too often of not giving sufficient power to the local authorities. This is a matter for local authority members to decide. These tertiary roads will receive attention in the future and I await with interest the findings of the new pavement study on this category of road.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">The Cathaoirleach ruled out of order a debate initiated by Senator Bannon on funding and assistance through the health boards for primary medical certificates. This matter is currently being considered by the Minister for Finance as a result of the interdepartmental group which carried out an extensive study of it some time ago. I am sure the Senator, even in his capacity as a councillor, would have made a submission to the relevant Minister at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">It is difficult to listen to criticism – although this is what we are here for, but such criticism should be constructive – from Senator Bannon. I am not here to ask questions but to answer them. Nevertheless, I would like to ask Senator Bannon if he is aware of his local authority's contribution to the non-national roads in its area. If he is not, I will tell him what it was.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">The 2003 Estimate for this area is €432,000 compared with €410,700 last year. We must be realistic about this. I am making an obvious point. If there are problems in this area, local authorities have a duty and a responsibility to contribute some of their resources to address them. A number of local authorities this year reduced their resources in this area, possibly because they are under pressure. I made this point here yesterday and the facts can be made available to Senators if they wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">This is a difficult year in terms of resources. The Department, through the local government fund, increased its contribution by 6%, bringing the local government fund for 2000 to an all time record of €1.048 billion in comparison with an amount of €701 million in the fund in 1999. We are, therefore, making progress. We have a multi-annual programme for 2002 to 2005. I want to adhere to the amendment before us. If there are difficulties in some local authorities, they should communicate with us on them and we will act as positively as we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Unfortunately, I am unable to accept this amendment because it would not be in the interests of any local authority that an amount of €65 million should be ring-fenced for tertiary roads, which comprise only 23% of the non-national road network. That is not to say that I do not accept that there is a problem, but any Members who have been involved in public life for a long period will realise that all difficulties are not resolved immediately. We have a programme in place and we will have another one in place after 2005. I await the outcome of the pavement condition study and I would be interested in its views and recommendations in regard to these roads.</p>

As the Minister of State is aware, Longford is a poor and impoverished county and recent figures from the Central Statistics Office confirm this. Having regard to the disposable income per head of population, a person living in County Longford would have a disposal income of €4,000 less than the national average. Such income comes from a low rate base – in the region of 7% in the county, which is due to the number of industries that have been closed down. We have an impoverished county due to neglect on the part of the Government and its immediate predecessor to bring services and industry into the county.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">In reply to Senator Kitt and the Minister of State, the Labour Party tabled this amendment because there is a particular problem regarding tertiary roads. The funding that is being made available is additional. Where additional funds are available, it would be good for motorists to see that they are being put to good use. However, that is not evident from what the Minister of State said or from the way money has been allocated to the road programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">This amendment does not in any way give priority to tertiary roads over other types of non-national roads. There is a particular problem regarding tertiary roads and this additional funding provides an opportunity to address it. However, the money seems to be going into a black hole and we cannot see the use to which it is being put in terms of the roads budget. What we propose would be a way of identifying exactly where the money is going.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">The Minister of State said that it is a matter for local authorities to decide how they deal with allocations for tertiary roads. I do not have the exact figures for my local authority but my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, asked his council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, about this. It predicted that the estimate for the restoration of tertiary roads in its area would be €10 million, whereas the money it could provide from its own resources in any year was approximately €500,000. That is a big shortfall which is probably replicated in other areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The economy performed well for the past few years. Things may be slowing down now but we have not gone completely downhill. Tertiary roads have become worse, as most people would agree, and this deterioration has caused huge annoyance among motorists. This amendment would help the Government to focus minds in local authorities to deal with tertiary roads more strategically than currently. There are provisions which enable local authorities to view other roads in a more strategic way, while they tend to view tertiary roads in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner and dealing with them comes under discretionary funding. One has to shout just to get a pothole filled, but they reappear a few months later. They should be dealt with more strategically.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">All our roads are important but there is a particular problem with tertiary roads, which are in very poor condition. Defective surfaces on such roads are causing huge damage to cars and are also responsible for accidents. There is another cost here when local authorities are sued. The more annoyed motorists become, the more likely they are to sue local authorities for the damage done to their cars and for personal injuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">My colleague, Deputy Howlin, proposed the local government fund when he was Minister for the Environment. The idea was to ring-fence the fund and make it accountable for how money is spent. However, I am a member of a local authority and to me the funding process is very mysterious. I cannot see the necessary accountability for the expenditure of this money.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">This amendment seeks to ensure this is not another stealth tax which seeks to make up the shortfall arising as a result of Government mistakes. It would be far more constructive if people could see the money going to a particular purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">This is a matter for each local authority and we will look at it on an authority by authority basis. Senator Tuffy mentioned Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which under the 2003 allocation receives €9 million, though there is nothing for tertiary roads. However, if one goes back a few years it received €127,000 for that sector. This is a matter of priorities but if her local authority comes to us we will consider its application in the manner suggested by Senator Kitt.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Motor taxation is not a budgetary issue. The money accrued is ring-fenced and goes into the local government fund. There is also a substantial Exchequer contribution. As a result of the increase in motor tax over the years and generous increases in the State contribution to the local government fund, the non-national roads grants have increased from €214 million in 1997 to €435 million last year, a record level of investment. We will do our utmost to maintain those levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">I do not want to pursue the local politics of Longford but the general purpose grant for Longford has increased from €4.2 million in 1997 to €9.3 million in €2003. That is an increase of just under 120% and the increase in funding for non-national roads has increased by 67%. That positive discrimination is done on the basis of need and I realise that the county requires extra funding. The message should go out, however, that the Department is being as generous as possible and will look at each county on the basis of its needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Senator Bannon has the record which states that Longford County Council has the lowest own-resources in the country. I appreciate his point about the rate base but it is a good signal to the Department if an increase is indicated there because that would show this is a priority. We are supplementing the local authorities' resources but most of the time it looks like they are supplementing ours.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Unfortunately I cannot accept the amendment but, as I said to Senator Tuffy's colleague in the Dáil, the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has been pursuing this vigorously. The pavement study will be important if one wants the council to look at a number of roads. However, this will not be an add-on; it will be in substitution for something else and that will not be palatable. I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

There have been cruel increases already at a time when inflation is between 4% and 6% and I am trying to help those with overstretched pockets, particularly young people.

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_151">The effect of this amendment would be to eliminate altogether the existing relatively low surcharge that applies to taxing one's car on a quarterly rather than annual basis. Fractions of a euro are rounded downwards for motor tax purposes and the proposed amendment would make it cheaper to tax a car on a quarterly rather than an annual basis. There would also be additional administration costs to take into consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">There is no sound basis for doing this. It would encourage a far greater degree of quarterly taxing, which would have two effects. It would significantly increase the administrative costs involved in the motor tax process which, in turn, would reduce the amount available for the local government fund and would also lead to an increase in queuing time in motor tax offices and a slowdown in the time taken to turn around proposed tax renewals.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Last week, I took the opportunity to visit the Shannon motor tax office which was decentralised many years ago by the then Minister for the Environment, the late Sylvester Barrett. I was very impressed with the efficient operation of the office, which employs some 80 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Acceptance of the amendment would provide an incentive for those who pay motor tax on an annual basis to revert to paying on a quarterly basis. If they all chose to do so, it would be extremely costly and not in our best interests. The effect of the amendment would be that all motorists who renew their tax quarterly, with the exception of motorists in the two lowest bands, would pay less than last year. This would militate against the intention of the Bill which is to raise money for the local government fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">I am aware that some people have difficulty renewing their motor tax on an annual basis. To assist such motorists, the surcharge was reduced by the Government by regulation in 2001. The reduction amounted to a 1% saving. In addition, when the rates were converted into euro last year, the cent element of all rates was disregarded and for quarterly taxing the practice of rounding up to the nearest whole unit was replaced with rounding down to the nearest euro. I hope the House will agree that quarterly renewals have been dealt with in a fair and reasonable manner in recent years. In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Senator Bannon made a brief reference to taxation for disabled drivers. Senators will be aware that concessions are available for such drivers. Those who have successfully applied for the primary medical certificate benefit from reduced VRT and VAT rates. There is no doubt, therefore, that the difficult circumstances experienced by disabled drivers have been taken into consideration.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_78">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_157">The Minister of State and I, as well as many others, can afford to renew our motor tax annually. Mainly we do this for convenience because we do not want to queue to pay our motor tax as many as four times a year. Does the Minister of State have statistics on the number of people who pay quarterly tax?</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Young people, particularly those under 25 years, should be offered special facilities as they have major financial commitments in terms of purchasing their first car or leaving home to live in rented accommodation. The astronomical cost of insurance for persons under 25 years is higher than the value of the car in most cases. Memories of youth are lasting and steps should be taken to facilitate and encourage young people. Those who renew their tax quarterly tend to be the least well-off in society who cannot afford to pay annually. The purpose of the amendment is to accommodate this group.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_79" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_159">I appreciate the points the Senator makes. Everyone can face financial pressure and I readily accept that motor taxation is expensive for young people. More importantly, however, their insurance costs are much too high, a problem I hope will be rectified by the steps being taken by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The annual rate of motor taxation for cars in the 1,300 cc to 1,400 cc range is €278. The quarterly old rate was €70. This year the new quarterly rate will be €78, a minimal increase of €8, which is both reasonable and fair. If the large number of people who tax their cars on an annual basis decided to do so on a quarterly basis, it would create a phenomenal amount of additional expense and reduce the moneys available to the local government fund and the roads fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The rough estimate of the figures the Senator requested is that 45% of motor tax is paid on an annual basis, some 30% on a quarterly basis and some 25% on a half-yearly basis. If everyone decided to pay on a quarterly basis, it would cause serious problems. The difference between the rates is minimal and, therefore, the proposal is unwarranted.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_164">In page 4, lines 20 to 22, to delete all words from and including "substituting" in line 20 down to and including "Schedule" in line 22 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_165">"increasing the figures contained in Part 1 (inserted by the Act of 2001) of the first-mentioned Schedule by 5 per cent".</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The purpose of the amendment is to keep the figure in line with inflation. The Government is the greatest offender in terms of contributing to inflation. The proposed figure of 5% is roughly in line with the inflation rate. Amendment No. 4 proposes to substitute the figure of €43 on page 4 with €40. Again, the purpose of the proposal is to accommodate young people and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">People are feeling overstretched. Even since the war in Iraq began, fuel prices have increased considerably, creating additional demands on people and adding to inflation. In my conversations on the issue of motoring, the most common cause of annoyance is the high cost of motoring and the duties one must pay. There is no protection available to motorists whose cars are vandalised or robbed. The proposed figure of €40 is realistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Elderly people are badly affected by motor tax as they usually use their cars only once or twice a week to collect their pension at the post office or attend mass on Sundays. Motor tax is a hefty burden on this group which we propose to help. We will all reach old age some day. We should introduce concessions for this group.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">I ask the Minister of State to accept these realistic amendments which would reduce the levy from €43 to €40 and €255 to €240 respectively. I also ask him to accommodate disabled drivers by providing for some concessions in this area. People feel the manner in which the Government increased road tax after the budget was cold, callous and unfair and has added to inflation. I ask the Minister to be accommodating.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_170">I second the amendment. It would be better to keep the increases in line with inflation. As Senator Bannon said, these types of increases will only add to inflation and affect everybody unfairly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_83" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_171">As the House is aware, the purpose of the increases in motor tax is to fund local authorities' general purpose and road funds in 2003. The level of increase in motor tax rates provided for in the Financial Resolution passed by the Dáil on 12 December last, and provided for in this Bill, is set at 12%. The Senator's amendment would see the increases reduced to 5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">A decision to increase taxes is not taken lightly. If a smaller percentage increase was feasible, it would have been proposed but it must be remembered that the decision to increase motor tax rates was taken against the background of the past ten years, from 1992. If we were to increase motor tax on a yearly basis in line with inflation, up to last year that increase would have amounted to a cumulative figure of 33%. However, the increase was 3% in 1998, 3% at the beginning of 1999 and between 4% and 6% in 2001, giving a total increase of 12%. It has been suggested by Senator Bannon that we should increase taxes in line with inflation but we have done the opposite. There has been a 12% increase in the past ten years up to last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">I repeat what I said on Second Stage. For the majority of motorists the increase will be between 29 cent and 58 cent per week. The increases set out in the Bill have been introduced with good reason. The revenue generated by motor tax increases goes to the local government fund which, in turn, is used to finance the general purpose fund and non-national roads. If the Senator's amendment was to be accepted, it would significantly reduce the level of funding available to local authorities by €42 million. Nobody could condone this.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">In the light of current demands on local authority funding and the desire of the Government and local authorities to maintain non-national road spending at the 2002 record levels, it would not be sensible or wise to accept the Senator's amendment. I refer Senators to a debate in this House before Christmas when a case was made for more funding for local government. They cannot have it both ways.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_175">There are no additional services for motorists, despite the tax increases of 12%. Several people have approached me with regard to their cars being robbed or burgled. Some protection should be given to motorists who are annoyed about their cars being robbed. The Minister of State referred to the reduction in funding for roads but we were conned by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in the last budget when he left a shortfall of €70 million for road programmes nationally, which we now have to make up with extra taxation. Those are the facts which are evident in the Minister's Budget Statement. Every local authority has been affected by the shortfall. There is no extra money but people cannot be fooled. The Minister took that €70 million from the budget for the roads programme and this 12% increase in motor taxation which the people will have to pay is an additional tax. We should request that €70 million from the Minister to make up the shortfall in the roads programme nationally.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_85" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_176">There is no question of the Minister conning anyone. It was suggested in the other House that this would be additional funding over and above last year's figure but when the Minister introduced the Financial Resolution in the House on 12 December, he made it clear that the reason he increased motor taxation was to retain the same level investment in non-national roads. When I addressed the House recently, I made it clear that the allocation would be €434 million. Those of us who are pragmatic politicians stated clearly that in addition to this amount there would be an additional €65 million to €70 million. Anyone who says he or she was not aware that there would be the same record levels as last year is being economical with the facts and somewhat mischievous. I rest my case.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The question of cars being damaged is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Other increases are matters for the Minister for Finance. Insurance is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. We are all aware of the serious problems which we are trying to resolve.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Lest the message goes out from this House that those who qualify for the disabled driver's grant will be affected, there are concessions when it comes to taxation. Taxation in that area is minimal in that it covers administration costs but we are talking about those individuals whose application for the grant is successful. There may be another band in addition to this but that is the position.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_183">I thank all the Senators who have contributed to the debate. I thank the Leader of the House and the Seanad staff for their co-operation in ensuring this Bill will be passed by both Houses before the statutory date. This Bill is important as it provides for the local government fund for various local authorities and ensures the increase of the general purpose fund by some 6%. It will also ensure the maintenance of the record levels of funding for the non-national roads at €434 million. That is in sharp contrast with €214 million in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">This Bill is about local government, the arm of democracy closest to the citizens. It is incumbent on us in the Oireachtas and the Government to ensure that the additional funding is provided in the local government fund. I am particularly pleased by the independent evaluation carried out by economic consultants, Fitzpatrick Associates. Of course, there will be cases where people are unhappy with the quality and standard of specific roads. In a macro sense, the Fitzpatrick Associates report referred to the reasonable and efficient basis on which our roads are maintained. If we can improve on the efficiency and value for money, then the Department will work in co-operation with the local authorities. It is the Government's intention to maintain high standards and to develop our non-national roads network.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">I reiterate that the local government fund is funding for the roads network. It is ring-fenced and is under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and cannot be transferred to another Department.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_186">I thank the Minister of State for being with us while carrying this legislation through the House. We have had our political differences on this Bill and many other issues but I have always found him very approachable, even prior to my election to the Seanad. He is a good friend of local authorities and was the first local authority representative from Donegal when the Local Authority Members Association was established. As a Minister of State, he is co-operative in dealing with the association and tuned in to issues affecting local government. I also thank the officials of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Seanad staff for their assistance in carrying through this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Financial strategy for local government is an issue that must be dealt with. There are numerous cash-starved local authorities, in particular the smaller ones that come from a low rate base. The whole issue of equalisation needs to be examined quickly. I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">The non-national roads are important, particularly to the people who use them. We gave a list today of county, regional and tertiary roads and of the local improvement schemes which are under way. I was glad to hear the Minister for State say that he would look at requests from local authorities for all these roads in the multi-annual programme and I hope we will be able to deliver on that. He seems to have the funds and we will have more through the local government fund which he will be able to deliver for the people of each county. I feel confident that if the local authorities put forward those proposals they will get a good response from the Minister of State. I thank him again for his attendance.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">"(2) Within two years of the coming into operation of this Act, the Minister shall present to the Oireachtas a review of the operation of the Act which will <i>inter alia</i>, assess–</p>
          <p eId="para_193">(<i>a</i>) the impact of the operation of the Act on the Credit Union Movement,</p>

          <p eId="para_195">and</p>

          <p eId="para_201">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House for the debate on this important legislation. My amendment tries to deal with the most contentious element of the Bill, which is the idea of combining the consumer protection element with the existing responsibilities of the Central Bank for the financial services sector. The purpose of the amendment is to enshrine the consumer protection element, which many commentators have said is contradictory to the already aforementioned position of the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">This amendment seeks a review, after two years of the operation of the Bill, on how it is working, the impact it is having for consumers and its impact on the credit unions – which have expressed concern about this legislation and the impact it may have on them – and on competition in the banking sector. I urge the Minister to consider the amendment. It tries to allay some of the fears of those people who have reservations about the proposed new authority and the seemingly diverse roles which it authority seeks to fill. I would be interested to hear the Minister's response.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">Regardless of its merits, with which I will deal in a moment, the placing of the amendment in the preliminary section of the Bill is extraordinary. It is an amendment of some substance and this is clearly the wrong place for it. I have not worked out where it should go, but to put a matter of substance like this in the preliminary section is a fairly extraordinary piece of drafting.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_206">To come to the substance of the matter, despite a difficulty a few years ago the Government has good and close relations with the credit union movement and deeply appreciates and values the good work the credit union movement does in practically every town. There are ongoing meetings between the credit union movement and the Department of Finance and, where necessary, the Government. If serious problems were arising, I am sure they would be discussed and dealt with and, therefore, it is redundant to include a two-year review. The relations between the credit union movement and the Government and the Department of Finance are sufficiently close that if serious problems requiring legislative amendment arise, they would be dealt with without need for a formal review.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The new body has a different remit from the existing one. I am sure it will be anxious to report on the various dimensions of its activities, including those listed by Senator Phelan, such as protection of consumer savings, transparency of information, competition and redress for consumer grievances. I am sure that, from time to time, it will be accessible to a joint committee of the Oireachtas. Apart from my difficulty about where Senator Phelan wishes to place this amendment, the substance of it is superfluous and redundant in that all these matters will be taken care of naturally in the course of the proper operation of the Act.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_208">I would not wish to accuse Senator Phelan of superfluity and redundancy, but I am not disposed to accepting the amendment. He has suggested that a review of the operation of the Bill take place and that the results of this should be presented to the Oireachtas within a two-year period after the commencement of the legislation. The Minister for Finance indicated at an earlier stage that any review of this type should be delayed until we see how the legislation has operated over a number of years. With regard to the spirit of the amendment, I must point out that both the Central Bank and the regulatory authority will be obliged under this legislation to prepare an annual report which, under the legislation, must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In addition, the regulatory authority will be obliged to devise its annual strategic plan, which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and, subsequently, published by the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">It is also important to note that under section 33AM of the principal Act it is provided that certain officers of the bank can be required to attend before an appropriate Oireachtas committee. This element of accountability to the Oireachtas is built into the legislation. It will allow the Oireachtas ample opportunity to assess the operations and activities of the Central Bank and the regulatory authority. The Director of Consumer Affairs and the Registrar of Credit Unions are also required to produce strategic plans and annual reports for submission to the regulatory authority. Under those circumstances, I believe there is an effective review and assessment process involving the Houses of the Oireachtas which is facilitated by the proposed provisions of this Bill. For those reasons, I am not disposed to accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">I do not want to anticipate the Senator, but he mentioned consumer protection and I see he has a number of amendments down which deal with this. I would prefer to address that issue at this stage. The Minister was careful to ensure that the concerns of the Irish League of Credit Unions were taken into account in devising this legislation. A meeting took place between the Minister and a delegation from the board of the ILCU and this was followed up by a number of meetings between the league representatives and officers of the Department of Finance. The ILCU accepts that the Bill, as it now stands, recognises the distinct voluntary character and social and economic role of credit unions and is content with that. While I understand the vigilance of the Senator in respect of the credit union movement, which, as we heard on Second Stage, is shared by all Members, the fact remains that the league and its objections have been accommodated in the Bill as it stands.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">The matter of competition issues falls outside this legislation. In fact, the Competition Authority is at present conducting an investigation into bank charges.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_212">I understand what the Minister of State and Senator Mansergh are saying. I would love to employ a draftsman, but unfortunately I cannot do so. I gather that the Minister of State might be supportive of the amendment if it was placed elsewhere in the Bill. The regulations operated by the Central Bank with regard to the banking industry are designed to ensure that the structure stays in place – that banks keep operating and that people's money will not be affected by banks' becoming insolvent. However, the other part of the legislation is the complete opposite. It deals with consumer protection and tries to ensure that the consumer is not being ripped off. The two different objectives are miles apart.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">While I accept that section 1 might not be the ideal position for the amendment, the thrust of it is quite sensible and, therefore, I am disappointed. I understand that there is an annual report and a strategic plan, but there is a place within the framework of the Bill for some sort of impact statement, particularly for credit unions – for the sake of consumer protection – which is apart from these.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">The new section 5A(1)(<i>g</i>) to be inserted into the principal Act deals with the collection and publishing of data by the authority.

What is proposed in this paragraph is not clear and the amendment elaborates upon what is already contained there.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_96" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_217">The Senator has returned to his main criticism of the Bill, which relates to the combination of the prudential regulation function and the consumer protection function in one authority. The amendment proposes to change section 5A of the principal Act – the Central Bank Act 1942 – which provides for the general functions and powers of the bank. It is important to note that the responsibility for consumer protection in the Bill is actually delegated from the bank to the regulatory authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The legislation relating to the regulatory authority provides a variety of measures to deal with the quality of financial services to consumers and accountability in regard to consumer protection. In a sense, these functions are invested in the regulatory authority under the Bill. The regulatory authority, for example, is charged with responsibility for taking action to increase the awareness among members of the public of available financial services and the cost to consumers, risks and benefits associated with the provision of those services under the new section 33C(4). This includes reference to the quality of financial services to customers, which is in the spirit of the amendment tabled by the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">In addition, the Bill provides for the appointment of a person to the statutory post of Consumer Director, who will be responsible for monitoring the provision of financial services to consumers of those services, having regard to the public interest and to the interest of consumers. This is provided for in the new section 33S(1)(<i>b</i>). The Consumer Director will be required under the Bill to produce an annual report and one of the matters that must be included in this is the steps that have been taken by the regulatory authority to increase the awareness of consumers of relevant financial services of the cost to consumers and the risks and benefits involved in using those service under the new section 33T(3)(<i>b</i>). The regulatory authority is also required to produce an annual report which must be submitted to the Minister for Finance, who must, in turn, have the report laid before the Houses under the new section 33O.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Both the Consumer Director and the regulatory authority are required to produce their strategic plans each year and these must specify the nature and scope of the activities to be undertaken and the strategies and policies for achieving the objectives. The chairperson of the regulatory authority, the chief executive of the regulatory authority and the Consumer Director can all be called before a relevant Oireachtas committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">It is appropriate that the regulatory authority take responsibility for matters relating to consumer protection and awareness. The existing provisions of the Bill allow the regulatory authority to address the matters raised by the Senator and to be held accountable for these matters. I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment. My argument is that on the narrow issue of the amendment itself, the matters comprehended in it are comprehended in the Bill under the heading of the regulatory authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">I was going to make the same point as the Minister of State in much shorter form, but I prudently decided to listen to his explanation first. The authority has different parts and it is important not to confuse their functions. All the concerns contained in Senator Phelan's amendments are perfectly legitimate and well founded, but it is a question not of ends but of means. As the Minister of State said, the consumer interest is well catered for in the way the authority is laid out.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">This amendment states that within two and a half years the functions and responsibilities of the authority would be laid out in a consolidated statement. The proposed paragraph (<i>i</i>) states: “to perform such other functions as are imposed on it by or under this and any other Act or law”. This is a very open statement. While I accept the authority will have many diverse functions and at this stage it may be necessary to have such a provision, my amendment would propose a timeframe for issuing a statement of the functions of the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">This amendment should not be complicated for the Minister of State to accept. It could easily be done and would improve this section of the Bill. As it currently stands, it is rather open-ended. Such an amendment would be useful.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">Having studied the Bill, before it came to Seanad Éireann and during its passage, I can well understand the spirit that motivated this amendment. I disagree with the Senator in saying this consolidation could easily be done. It would be far from an easy task to consolidate this legislation. However, consolidation is very desirable and was requested by all parties on Second Stage in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I draw the Senator's attention to the fact that the McDowell group recommended that consolidation be carried out of all the statute revisions relating to the single regulatory authority. The European Central Bank also raised this issue in its formal opinion on the Bill. The Minister for Finance has stated there will be consolidation. I can appreciate how difficult it has been for Senators to study this Bill when in a sense they are looking at the beginning of the bricks and scaffolding of a measure which will eventually become a house. The Senator is suggesting we should put a deadline on its construction.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_230">That will be a very complex process for which the Minister for Finance has accepted responsibility. Because the regulatory authority deals with so many parts of the financial sector, some consideration will have to be given to whether consolidation alone is the appropriate way to go or whether there should be some harmonisation of the legislation for different sectors at the same time as consolidation. The Minister is committed to carrying out the exercise. However, he does not believe it is either necessary or desirable to set a timetable for the bank. The regulatory authority will have to look at this on its establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The Minister stated he would do his best to have the matter addressed while he was Minister for Finance but would not accept the timescale proposed and because of the size of the Bill and separate major legislation, the (No. 2) Bill, had to be addressed. Public consultation has taken place on that Bill. This Bill will include consultative panels with consumers and the financial services industry. The consumer panel will review the discharge by the regulatory authority of its functions, including those of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Registrar of Credit Unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">In a sense the (No. 2) Bill is a second set of bricks, mortar and scaffolding in this area. When both Bills are ready and the regulatory authority has an opportunity to look at all the various sectors comprehended by this legislation, we will be in a far better position to advance the consolidation exercise. At this stage it is important that the regulatory authority is established. This has been a very difficult legal exercise. While I appreciate the work was very detailed and complex, involving amendment to substantial legislation, the parliamentary counsel has done a very good job in identifying and itemising much of the existing position in the Schedules to the Bill before the House. At this stage it would be premature to insert a deadline on consolidation into the Bill.</p>

I appreciate his argument. Given the length and complexity of the Bill and all the interests involved, it would not be appropriate to put a particular deadline on it. The Minister has given a commitment, in principle, that this will be done if possible during the lifetime of the Government. One should not make commitments that one is not certain of being able to keep.</p>

I share the view of many that commitments were made that have not been honoured. I understand what the Minister of State has said. If I used the word "easy", it was unintentional. Even in the my short time here, I have seen the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Bill 2002, a monumental piece of work. I know considerable work went into this Bill and did not mean in any way to denigrate the work carried out by those who drafted it.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I am again disappointed the Minister of State has not accepted my amendment. Many items in this country are allowed to continue without timeframes, not just in the area of finance. It would be appropriate to have a timeframe. I ask the Minister of State to tell me when the (No. 2) Bill will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It was promised at the end of last year and we have still not seen it. While I understand consolidation cannot occur until it has been published, I would be fearful that it might not be published as soon as had been promised.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_257">This amendment seeks to provide that persons appointed to the board of the bank by the Minister for Finance should include persons with experience in the delivery of financial services, in the requirements for adequate consumer protection and the needs of business in a competitive environment. In making appointments, the main aim of the Minister for Finance is to select persons with the necessary qualities and attributes of each office, who are independent of the Government in the exercise of their functions. Needless to say, any such appointments can only be made after the most careful consideration. In this respect it is unnecessary to tie the hands of future Ministers for Finance by setting specific criteria for the appointment of certain directors of the board of the bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I am sure the Senator is aware that certain persons are designated as members of the board by virtue of their office and there are five such persons specified in the Bill already. In those circumstances, it seems reasonable to leave the Minister for Finance with some discretion in relation to the balance of the appointments. The Senator raised a valid question about trust in politics and politicians but, under our constitutional system, legislation gives Ministers powers which they have to exercise and be accountable for to the Oireachtas, as well as being responsible at the bar of public opinion. Therefore, any Minister for Finance has to be careful in the exercise of this more than any other appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">I was not impressed by Senator Mansergh's designation of the Ballygobackwards cumann. I was taken with Senator Phelan's observations about political parties and I am sure he will agree that it is important that people participate in political parties and that membership should not necessarily disqualify a person from being a governor of the Central Bank.</p>

Nothing in the text of the amendment ties the Minister's hands because it is the most loose form of words that could possible be applied to an amendment of this form.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I was taken by what the Senator and the Minister had to say because they both agreed with the amendment without accepting it. Such a loose form of words could not affect the Minister's ability to appoint people with suitable qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I share the views expressed by the Minister of State and Senator Mansergh about membership of a political party. I am proud to be a member of a political party. Membership of a political party should not be a barrier to people becoming members of State boards or authorities and it is not my intention that it should be. That is not mentioned in the amendment. The amendment merely provides that the appointees should have qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">We have seen in recent years the appointment of people to State boards in circumstances where other people with more suitable qualifications to take on the responsibilities of the job could have been found. The purpose of the amendment is to deal with that and I am disappointed the Minister of State could not accept it. The amendment would not have been strictly binding on the Minister for Finance.</p>

Senator Phelan would have to be more specific. I am not aware of any instance where anyone other than highly qualified people have been appointed to a body such as the board of the Central Bank. I do not accept that the fears expressed have any substance.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">There is a general issue about appointments to State bodies, but that argument does not apply to the authority we are discussing. It would be suicidal in terms of financial confidence for any Government to appoint people who were blatantly not well qualified. I have no fears that it would happen under this or any other Government.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_268">Senator Mansergh was put forward by a large number of cumainn, rather than taken backwards, in the recent past. Senator Phelan mentioned the looseness of the proposed amendment. That is not desirable in legislation. Senators are aware of the constitutional provisions affecting qualification for membership of Seanad Éireann and the amount of legislation that had to be provided, whether by way of judicial referee or final determination, to ensure that a person put forward for a particular vocational panel should be qualified for Seanad membership. When a provision such as this is inserted in legislation, one increases the danger that an appointment can be invalidated through non-compliance with the provision in some unexpected way. From the point of view of legal certainty, there is an argument for a simple, bald provision providing for an appointment. That makes it difficult to legally question its validity.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I have addressed the wider argument and do not wish to repeat it. However, it is important to note that there are five clear determined appointments. The Senator should not be under the impression that, in relation to the balance of the appointments, the Minister is at large. The Minister must make the appointments under the scheme of the legislation, which deals with financial regulation, and they must command the confidence of the sectors involved. He will be accountable for that to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

This relates to the debate we had earlier about the two separate roles of the authority.

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_273">The proposed amendment changes the provisions relating to the membership of the regulatory authority so as to provide that the Minister for Finance may designate the Director of Consumer Affairs as an official member of that authority. However, the Bill allows for this possibility. The proposed new section 33E(2) of the principal Act, as inserted by section 26 of the Bill, provides that the Minister may, instead of appointing a person to be a member of the regulatory authority, designate the holder of a specified office as an official member of that authority. That power, although stated in more abstract language, is already conferred on the Minister in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">The Director of Consumer Affairs is the holder of a specified office within the meaning of the Bill and the current wording of subsection (2) leaves it open to the Minister to appoint the director as an official member of the regulatory authority. The proposed amendment is superfluous. Its purpose is already comprehended by the legislation and there is no difficulty about designating the Director of Consumer Affairs as a member of the regulatory authority. It is permitted under the legislation. On that technical ground, I oppose the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">This might be the appropriate time to address the wider question raised by the Senator about the combination of the two functions of prudential regulation and consumer protection. That has been the main focus of the criticism of the Bill from the political interest represented by the Senator. The Central Bank is responsible for the prudential supervision of financial institutions operating in the State, such as banks and building societies, while the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment supervises the insurance industry. The Director of Consumer Affairs has certain responsibilities under the Consumer Credit Act 1995 in relation to financial service providers, including responsibilities in respect of charges and advertising.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Due to legal confidentiality requirements, there has been a well highlighted difficulty in the full exchange of information between these regulators. The McDowell group felt strongly that separating the consumer issue from the prudential regulator had two disadvantages. First, it left unresolved the legal problem of the exchange of relevant information and, second, the advantages of a one-stop-shop would be lost in that there would be two official bodies dealing with different aspects of financial services regulation. The McDowell group concluded that, given the requirement imposed by the relevant EU law, the best mechanism for providing for the maximum flow of information between prudential regulators and those concerned with consumer protection was to combine the two functions in one authority. The Government considered that this restriction on the exchange of information was unacceptable. As a result of this and other considerations, the Government decided to propose the structure that is before the House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The question of how best to deal with the issues arising from combining the functions of prudential regulation and consumer protection were dealt with comprehensively in the McDowell group report. A number of options were examined to see how best each of them would work. The group examined the issue of protecting the interests of clients of financial institutions on two levels: first, the level of the protection of the consumer interest in the context of solvency of regulated entities; and, second, the level of the individual consumer and his or her relationship with a particular financial institution. The relationship between these levels was looked at, particularly from the point of view of the obligations imposed under EU law in regard to the prohibition on disclosure of information to the relevant authorities on issues for which they have no statutory function. We know from the DIRT inquiry, for example, how important it is that we can elicit and disclose certain information.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">In the end, the expert group took the view that consumers' interests would be best served by combining the functions of consumer protection and prudential regulation in one body. The alternatives examined included separate authorities for prudential regulation and consumer protection and two competent authorities, one having a consumer protection function, and a regulatory authority with a subsidiary responsible for consumer protection. When one considers those options, I am sure the Senator will appreciate the difficulties they would have given rise to. They were all ruled out as it is only within the entity which combines the prudential regulation function with the consumer protection function that the disclosure of information between both could be done within the provisions of EU law.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Apart from the issue of the exchange of information, the Government was of the view that integration of prudential supervision and consumer protection did provide certain advantages. First, it provides a one-stop-shop for consumers, businesses and the financial services industry by having the regulation of insurance, banking and credit unions under one roof. Second, Ireland is a relatively small country in international financial terms, with a limited pool of expertise in the case of financial regulation. The building of a critical mass of skills relating to financial regulation in a single location is of major importance to the country. Third, it does place the interests of consumers at the heart of financial services regulation by giving the authority specific responsibilities in this regard. The Government is satisfied that the structure will work well but only time will tell.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The Bill provides for very clear functions of accountability which the proposed authority and the director of consumer affairs in that authority will have to the Houses of the Oireachtas. There is a clear delineation of the functions between the authority, the Director of Consumer Affairs and the registrar of credit unions, all of whom must produce plans and policy objectives which will be integrated into an overall strategic plan to be approved by the Minister. That is how the Government has addressed this issue and I thank the Senator for allowing me the opportunity of putting that on the record.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_281">I appreciate the Minister's reply dealing with what is the substantive argument concerning the Bill. While it is true that the McDowell report recommended a one-stop-shop facility both for consumer protection and the authority's regulatory role, there was an apparent contradiction in that, of the European countries examined by McDowell, virtually none had the one-stop-shop system. Both roles were separated in most cases. Opposition spokespersons frequently look to Ministers to enshrine and enact recommendations contained in various reports on specific areas of concern. However, I found the McDowell report's recommendation for a one-stop-shop approach actually contradicted the norm in other European countries. I would like to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on that contradiction because it probably goes to the nub of the problem concerning this legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_282">That has been the kernel of the objection to the Bill as raised by Fine Gael. It is important to stress, however, that this is a new Bill and is not simply a case of "New presbyter is but old priest writ large". The Bill is detailed and essentially transforms the Central Bank into a new bank which combines a regulatory authority. Because of the fundamental change in character of the bank that is envisaged by the legislation, this is a case of a leopard changing its spots. The Government took a view on combining the functions so that the issue of prudential regulation, which is the bank's traditional function, is restated in the Bill but will now be combined with consumer protection in the regulatory authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The choice of an appropriate supervisory structure is a difficult one. The Senator is well aware of the huge changes that have taken place in the financial industry in recent decades, where the traditional lines of demarcation have become blurred in the provision of financial services. Financial institutions of all types now tend to offer products and services, directly or through affiliates, that compete not only against those offered by similar types of institution, but also against those offered by other categories of service provider. We see this happening in the various markets that exist in the financial services sector, including credit, loans and current accounts. There is no consensus as to the existence of a single best approach in this particular area.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The Government had to make a judgment call which was that, by combining both functions in a small jurisdiction like Ireland, the one-stop-shop would have all the information available to it. There is an attraction and cogency to that argument. It is hoped that we can establish the authority, with all due respects to the House, by 1 May this year. Assuming we can do that, the legislation will have provided an opportunity to establish an authority that can put consumer protection at the heart of good banking practice. By combining the functions one can create that opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">I understand Senator John Paul Phelan's concern because somehow we see the Central Bank as an overarching and very proper body. However, the idea that it would hold consumers' concerns fast to its heart is slightly improbable, to say the least, and I recall being a participant at various times in that debate around the Cabinet table. Hopefully, the Central Bank will adapt to having this role bestowed upon it and will grow into the consumer protection component of the role.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">We think of the Director of Consumer Affairs, Ms Foley, as being a person who deals with consumer issues arising from everyday life, including what one pays for various things and whether one's rights are being protected. As the role will be enshrined in legislation, however, I have no doubt that the Central Bank will adapt to it but there is no doubt that it will take time. It represents a change of focus and emphasis for the Central Bank because as well as dealing with the probity of our national finances, which it does with great acumen, it will now have to adapt to the consumer role also.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I gave this matter a great deal of thought at the time and on balance I think the legislation will be good for the Central Bank which will adapt to its new role. It will work out in the end because the bank's authority will combine all these activities which, in essence, will be a good thing.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">The McDowell group recommended that funding for the operation of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority should come from the industry. That was a core recommendation of the group. Levies to fund the regulatory authority will be prescribed by the chief executive with the agreement of the other members of the authority and by way of regulation. This will only be done after a detailed consultation process. Any regulations made by the chief executive must, in turn, be approved by the Minister for Finance who must lay them before each House of the Oireachtas.

          <p eId="para_294">The estimate of annual income and expenditure must specify the amounts expected to be collected and recovered during the financial year concerned from the imposition of the levies under section 33J; any other sources from which the funds are expected to be obtained during the year to finance the regulatory authority's activities and the amounts expected to be raised from these sources; and the activities that the authority proposes to undertake during the year. There is a great deal of specificity written into the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The McDowell group emphasised the importance of adopting an approach which achieved a fair and equitable outcome. The approach, as set out above, is considered the best to achieve that aim. It is preferable to that suggested by the Senator. The issuing of a statement, as the Senator proposes, would not achieve a desirable level of active consultation. This procedure, in addition to other accountability provisions elsewhere in the Bill, will ensure the chief executive of the regulatory authority is accountable to the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas in relation to the justification for the levies.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The regulatory authority must lay its annual estimates before the Houses of the Oireachtas following approval by the Minister. Their accountability will be supported by the fact that the authority must also submit its annual strategic plan and report to the Minister who, in turn, will lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister will also require the authority to ensure its annual report includes appropriate indicators of performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I am satisfied that this approach is a more effective one than that proposed by the Senator which would require the chief executive to only produce a statement. Therefore, with regret, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">This is not a complicated amendment. It merely seeks to ensure that when the regulatory authority appoints the Consumer Director, the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs would be consulted in the appointment process. It is appropriate that the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs as well as the Minister for Finance would be consulted on the appointment of the person to fill this position. We have had a discussion on consumer protection and consumer affairs and how they relate to the authority in general. It would be appropriate that the Minister with responsibility for this area would be consulted on this appointment. It is necessary to spell this out in the Bill because provision is already made for consulting the Minister for Finance in this regard while in other parts of the Bill provision is made for consulting the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In this section which deals with the appointment of the Consumer Director it is appropriate that provision should be made for the Minister with responsibility for this area to be consulted on this appointment and have a specific role in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">I wish to make a few common-sense remarks. I appreciate the practicality of the Senator's proposal. On the surface, it appears practical that the Minister for Finance should consult the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs on this appointment – in this case, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am aware that the Minister for Finance has many discussions with her on many matters, as is proper in the conduct of Government business. Therefore, the proposal made by the Senator seems correct. However, this is a financial measure coming from the Office of the Minister for Finance who manages his business very well and is not used to having to consult colleagues all the time about measures in his Department. The Senator's proposal appears to be practical and make common sense but in effect—</p>

We can have a giggle about it but apart from the many matters on which he has to consult all the time, this is a financial measure for which responsibility rests with him as Minister for Finance, not with the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs. Given that when dealing with an earlier amendment we ruled the Director of Consumer Affairs out of the deliberative process, it follows that the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs would not be involved in the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I accept what the Leader of the House has said. However, there is a circular argument to this issue. There are two roles within the regulatory authority. The role that the Consumer Director has to play and the functions of the authority in the area of consumer protection come within the responsibility of the Minister for Finance. I am not disagreeing with what the Leader said but surely there should be some level of consultation with the Minister responsible for consumer affairs on the appointment of the person concerned. I understand this comes within the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and that perhaps he does not like to consult but he might not have much longer to worry about consultation in his role as Minister. Be that as it may, it is appropriate that consultation with the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs on this appointment should be provided for in the Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_306">The Bill provides that the consumer Director is appointed by the other members of the regulatory authority. However, the Minister for Finance must give his or her approval before the appointment takes effect. The approval of the Minister is to ensure proper procedures have been followed by the authority. For example, the recent appointment of the person to fill the consumer director post was made after an open and extensive recruitment process. It does not seem necessary or appropriate that the Minister for Finance should have to consult any other Minister about the appointment because the function of the Minister for Finance in this regard is to ensure proper procedure has been followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Once this legislation is enacted, the regulatory authority in the bank will report to the Minister for Finance and, as such, he or she will be the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs in so far as they relate to financial services. In this respect, the Senator's amendment is unnecessary and I will not accept it. However, I must commend him on his sense of humour in tabling the amendment because how often in the Oireachtas do we enact legislation which provides that a particular step cannot be taken without the consent of the Minister for Finance?</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_309">The reason that is a necessary accompaniment to much legislation is the essential control which the Minister for Finance must maintain over expenditure and numbers in establishments in every branch of the State. By tradition the Department of Finance, as senior Department, frequently imposes a statutory obligation on a Minister to consult with it prior to a matter pertaining to establishment being raised by the relevant line Department. It is not desirable, as a matter of general principle which is separate from the Department of Finance's unique position, to put this type of matter into legislation. Ministers should consult each other all the time. While the proviso to protect the interests of the Department of Finance which is often inserted is understandable because it relates to a fundamental constitutional point regarding that Department's priority over other Departments, in general it is not desirable. The Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs, who is a Minister of State with delegated responsibility, is free at any time to consult the Minister for Finance about the appointment of a director of consumer affairs under the legislation. If that Minister is doing his or her job correctly he or she might decide to consult the Minister for Finance about it. There is no bar to Ministers consulting each other, irrespective of whether that is dealt with in legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">This is an interesting amendment.

          <p eId="para_317">As the Senator points out, though the Consumer Director has the power of initiative, he or she does not have the final power of decision. The actual code or requirement must be issued in the name of the regulatory authority and with the approval of the other members of that authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Codes or requirements will be issued to protect the consumer. It is important that there be complete agreement from the regulatory authority in whose name they are to be issued because if an institution is in breach of a code of conduct or requirement, it is the regulatory authority which will have to deal with that. Although the consumer director is a member of the authority, it is fitting that codes or requirements issued by the Consumer Director be in the name of the authority. The provision should remain as drafted and I am not able to accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The McDowell report recommended that the regulatory authority should have the power to impose penalties and the question of providing this power to the regulatory authority is being considered in the context of the (No. 2) Bill. As the imposition of penalties will be linked to these codes of practice, it is only right that the codes of practice should be issued in the name of the regulatory authority, not in the name of the Consumer Director. The power to impose penalties will be vested in the regulatory authority as recommended by the McDowell report.</p>

          <p eId="para_323">This subsection deals with the annual report of the authority, which the Minister referred to earlier. Such a report is an important document for any authority. The amendment seeks to impose a requirement that the annual report contain a comparison with similar sectors in other countries. I have spoken about the McDowell report, which included a comparison with other European countries and we discussed how the report appeared to contradict itself in that way. It would be appropriate in the early years of an authority to have a comparison built into the annual report to judge how it is faring in relation to similar authorities in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">This is a sensible suggestion and I urge the Minister of State to accept it. It could be important in the consumer protection area. The commercial banks recently published a document on banking charges which selectively excluded certain European countries where bank charges are quite low but included countries where bank charges are quite high. The comparison showed us at the lower end of the scale, but it is easy to select statistics to suit one's purpose. It would be useful if the authority included a comparison between consumer protection in our financial services sector and those of other countries.</p>

The chief executive is the person in the body being established by the legislation who has the power of initiative in this respect. I have no doubt he or she will take into account the kind of issue referred to by the Senator. In those circumstances it is not appropriate to be so prescriptive in legislation about what else should be contained in the report. International comparisons might well be a feature of the report but it is a matter for the consumer director to decide what comparisons or methods might be used to fulfil his or her obligations under the section. For those reasons I am unable to accept the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_329">I welcome this opportunity to debate once again the humanitarian situation in Iraq. We are daily witnessing scenes of conflict and distress in Iraq on our television screens and on my way here I heard about the bombing of a maternity hospital in Baghdad. We do not have the full details, but it is quite harrowing news. Some commentators have suggested that we are becoming used to the 24 hour coverage and that the humanitarian crisis has become somewhat less urgent. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Iraq is potentially facing a catastrophe with millions of innocent civilians threatened by conflict, hunger and a lack of basic needs. As I have stated in this Chamber previously, my focus remains on the protection and saving of human lives. This is the humanitarian imperative to which I am committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The current conflict in Iraq comes on top of years of hardship and difficulty. Since 1991, the Iraqi people have seen a dramatic drop in their living standards. In the league table that measures quality of life – the human development index – Iraq fell from 96th to 127th place in a little over ten years. No country has fallen so far so rapidly. This deterioration is translated at the basic human level into increased child deaths, malnutrition and high rates of disease. Iraqi children are facing extreme risks at this time and we should be conscious of the fact that they constitute 50% of the population of Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Prior to the beginning of the current conflict, 60% of the population, that is, 16 million people, were dependent on rations delivered under the UN Oil for Food Programme as their only food supply. The suspension of that programme on 17 March, when the Secretary General withdrew United Nations personnel from Iraq, has put even greater pressures on an already extremely vulnerable population.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I welcome the unanimous decision of the Security Council, through Resolution 1472, to authorise the Secretary General to administer the Oil for Food Programme for the next 45 days and possibly longer. I hope the resumption of the programme will mean that despite the difficulties, basic food assistance can once again reach those who are most vulnerable. The question is whether the food can reach them in the midst of a conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">Senators will be aware that since I last addressed the House on 21 March, I have announced an emergency assistance package for the people of Iraq, with a particular emphasis on women and children. These funds, amounting to €5 million, will be disbursed through non-governmental organisations and international agencies such as UNICEF and the Red Cross. We will work with those agencies which are best equipped and have the capacity and experience to respond effectively to this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I have already authorised initial disbursements from this emergency funding. Assistance amounting to €1.5 million will be provided for the Red Cross and Red Crescent family and for UNICEF. These agencies are present in Iraq and their staff, the great majority of whom are Iraqi, are providing assistance on a daily basis for those most in need. My Department is currently appraising applications for emergency funding from Concern, GOAL and Trócaire. These NGOs have a proven track record for delivering emergency assistance rapidly and effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Two particular issues have come to my attention in respect of the way Ireland and the international community can best respond to meet the basic needs of the Iraqi people. I refer to the importance of safe and secure access to those Iraqis who are most vulnerable and also to the need to avoid the large scale militarisation of the humanitarian effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">It is difficult to obtain accurate and reliable information on the suffering of the Iraqi people. We are aware that the ability of the population to cope has been severely eroded over the years. Reports by the UN and NGOs have stressed the deterioration in all aspects of basic living conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The vulnerability of Iraqi children has been underlined repeatedly. In any conflict the primary responsibility for the protection and welfare of the civilian population rests with the warring parties. In a case of foreign occupation, the occupying power must ensure the provision of food and medical supplies for the civilian population. Over the last few days I have looked with growing concern at scenes of food being thrown off the back of military trucks. This is an object lesson in how not to deliver humanitarian assistance. A military truck does not become a humanitarian truck because food is handed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The involvement of the military in the humanitarian effort can make the work of civilian agencies such as NGOs and others very difficult. There is a blurring of the separation between military and civilian personnel. This can be dangerous, especially if the neutrality and impartiality of emergency aid distribution is to be effective. Throwing bags of wheat off the back of a truck is no substitute for the painstaking efforts of NGOs and UN agencies in determining those who are most in need and delivering assistance on that basis. In emergencies all over the world, NGOs, the UN and others such as the Red Cross family have clearly demonstrated that they are best practised and equipped to provide the most effective assistance. We have only to look at their work in southern Africa, the Horn of Africa, East Timor and Afghanistan to see how effective they can be.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">I hope that safe corridors for the delivery of aid can be established as soon as possible. In Afghanistan this happened very rapidly. I then wish to see NGOs, the UN and other internationally recognised humanitarian agencies take the lead in the delivery of essential items to those most in need. From the outset I have emphasised that the UN must play a lead role in any humanitarian relief operation. I am pleased to note that the European Council at its meeting of 20-21 March echoed the need for the UN to play a central role during and after the current crisis and urged the Security Council to give it a strong mandate for this mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I recently returned from a visit to East Timor, an area in which this House is very interested, where I witnessed at first hand the successful outcome of a UN operation which has placed this newly independent country on the road to development and prosperity. In 1999 the situation in East Timor seemed almost hopeless. Its infrastructure was destroyed and a large proportion of its population was displaced, yet today that new nation is looking to the future with determination and confidence. The UN played the key role in this transformation. The East Timor experience clearly shows how strong a force for good the UN can be when its members act in a united manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">A few days ago the United Nations issued a major international appeal for assistance in relation to the humanitarian situation in Iraq over the next six months. This assistance will be provided in strict adherence to the humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality that underpin the mandates of the United Nations and its emergency response agencies. I am currently examining the various components of this appeal and I hope to be able to respond positively. I hope to provide assistance through our key UN partners – UNICEF, UNHCR and the World Food Programme. The needs of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs will also be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Ireland has already provided almost €15 million for UNICEF and the UNHCR in 2003 for their global operations, including emergencies. These funds are not earmarked and, thus, provide these agencies with the necessary flexibility and the potential for fast delivery which can improve effectiveness and save lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The European Union and its member states are the largest donors of development assistance in the world. It is anticipated that the EU's immediate response to the emergency in Iraq will be approximately €100 million. The first tranche of €3 million is already being used to deliver assistance in Iraq via the Red Cross. I welcome this rapid response and I will continue to use every opportunity to highlight the humanitarian needs of Iraq to my colleagues in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">I wish to speak about the Irish funding of €5 million being provided to save lives in Iraq. The funding provided by the Irish Government for development co-operation and the reduction of poverty in the developing world has never been at a higher level. The primary focus of our assistance remains sub-Saharan Africa, where the greatest number of poor countries in the world are located and this focus will not change. However, there are many millions of poor people in other parts of the world and we must and do respond to their needs as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I assure Senators that the emergency humanitarian budget, which currently stands at €23 million, is, by its very nature, designed to be flexible. It is not allocated in advance to any particular region or emergency but is available to save lives and livelihoods in whatever region of the world there is greatest need. We cannot predict the number or intensity of crises we have to address and, therefore, the funding must remain flexible. My priority is to address humanitarian needs wherever they arise. I have sufficient funding under the programme as a whole to deal with the full range of humanitarian needs and also to tackle the longer-term development challenges in Africa and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">In 2002 the Government intervened to provide humanitarian assistance such as food, water, shelter and medicines on more than 120 occasions in over 30 countries, including Iraq. This is testament to our commitment to respond to the needs of the poor in times of crisis. It was the flexible and unallocated nature of our funds which allowed us to respond quickly to humanitarian needs as they arose. As the situation in Iraq unfolds, Ireland will work as part of a concerted international humanitarian effort involving the United Nations, the European Union and NGOs.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">Conflict in Iraq is upon us – that is the reality. I dearly wish this conflict could have been avoided. Ireland worked very hard during our time on the Security Council to alleviate the effects of economic sanctions and to avoid war. There is a very important task ahead of me now. I will do absolutely everything in my power to alleviate the effects of suffering on the Iraqi people by contributing directly to the humanitarian efforts. I will also use every opportunity at EU level, at the UN and in other fora to advocate the return of the United Nations to a central role in the humanitarian and recovery efforts and the reconstruction of Iraq.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_151">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_349">I welcome the opportunity to discuss events in Iraq. This House debated war in Iraq in advance of the conflict. As the situation unfolds over the next few weeks, we must continue to speak out on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Television coverage was raised in the debate and has been mentioned repeatedly on the Order of Business, with Members rightly criticising the coverage we have seen. The conflict has been presented by some media outlets as if it were a video game. Members have stressed that real war is not a video game and will result in the realisation of its full horrors, with killing, destruction, deprivation and fear being visited on the people of Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">In spite of complaints about some coverage, however, we now enjoy the advantage that every citizen in the world with access to a television can see on a daily basis the destruction and civilian suffering the war is causing. If there is any positive result to such up-front coverage, it is that no one can remain immune to the pain and suffering being experienced in Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">We should not, however, be surprised by this because all wars are brutal. I previously quoted President Jimmy Carter, who said that war is sometimes the lesser of two evils but is always evil. War will never be as neat or surgical as the planners would have us believe. The greatest casualties are not inflicted on the armed factions or the political leaderships but upon the ordinary civilians and this war is no different.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The Oireachtas, and society in general, has been debating the rights and wrongs of the war in Iraq. Opinion about the conflict is divided, as has been demonstrated in recent polls. It is fitting, therefore, that we should debate the matter, but we were never going to have any real say about the conflict or veto over it. We could take a moral stance but we were in no position to stop the war or influence the participants. Since the United Nations was unable to stop the war, it was unlikely this House would be able to.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">At this stage I believe we can play a meaningful and leading role in relation to humanitarian relief for the people of Iraq. We can speak clearly and strongly on the question of rebuilding Iraq when the terrible conflict has ended. My party leader, Deputy Kenny, last night spoke about what he described as the two absolute requirements, first that there must be full respect for Iraqi sovereignty, for its territorial integrity and for its independence, and second the right of the Iraqi people to determine their own political future and to control their own natural resources, which must remain sacrosanct.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">We must insist that when the conflict ends, Iraq will not simply be an oil well for the West. We must demand that the resources of Iraq are used for its sole benefit. The participants in the conflict, in particular the US and Britain, have certainly given assurances that this is what they want. We must publicly insist that they fulfil those commitments. We must use every possible occasion to demand of the US and Britain in particular that they do so, that they will respect the rights of the Iraqi people to rebuild Iraq in the way the Iraqi people wish, that they will ensure the resources of Iraq will be used for the people of Iraq. This will happen only if the reconstruction of Iraq is directed by the United Nations, and it is a very necessary first step that the United Nations have a strategic role in the humanitarian effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I mentioned earlier how the Oireachtas and in a sense the country itself is divided on this issue, but as Kofi Annan said to the United Nations, we have it in our power to either deepen these divisions or to start the healing process. We in Fine Gael strongly believe that the huge humanitarian effort which must start immediately, and which will take many months and perhaps years to complete, is the best possible way to start the healing of these divisions, within the EU and the United Nations. It is important that we can speak with one voice in both Houses on this fundamental issue of aid, and that the moneys which will be made available will be additional, not money directed from other relief programmes. I welcome the commitment by the Minister of State and the Government to allocate the initial €5 million, and I hope it is an initial sum and that more money will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Hopefully the war will stop soon. Possibly it will not, yet if it does, the following are the brutal statistics as brought to our attention by the various aid agencies and non-governmental organisations, statistics which show clearly the huge humanitarian efforts which will be required. At least 11 million people will need some sort of humanitarian aid, at least 10,000 people will have died in the conflict and at least 900,000 Iraqis are likely to become refugees. Half a million people will be left sick or injured, three million mothers and children will require urgent food supplies, two million people at least will require shelter, and millions of people will have been affected by the disruption to the food supply chain.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Furthermore, there will be huge numbers of people who will be fleeing from central and southern Iraq into the northern region of the country, and many of these could fall victim to the land mines which litter these areas. The mines advisory group has currently identified over 2,000 mined areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">That is a picture of the enormous humanitarian aid requirements which will need to be put in place. John O'Shea of GOAL said in relation to the aid efforts – which the Minister of State touched on – that television footage on all the major networks on Wednesday night last provided a lesson in how not to deliver aid. If aid distribution is poorly planned, as the intervention in the Iraqi border town of Safwan appeared to be, then the one thing we can be assured is that only the strongest will receive aid. Opening the backs of a few trucks and letting a desperate crowd of people fight between themselves for aid demeans us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">As for the cost of aid, UNICEF is I understand indicating a short-term ballpark figure of approximately $166 million, a drop in the ocean in comparison to what the war itself is costing. I believe President Bush is currently seeking $76 billion from Congress to help continue the war effort. The message from this House, apart from the obvious message that the war should stop immediately, is that at European Union level and at the United Nations this Government must lead the efforts to direct the aid effort and the humanitarian effort. This project must not be left only to the United States and to Britain. The United Nations, as part of the process of rebuilding itself, must use the rebuilding of Iraq, and of hope in that country, as its first step.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_361">I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to speak again about this awful war. Over the last ten days not alone have we discussed it in this House, but there is probably not a sitting room in the country where people have not been glued to their televisions watching the trauma reflected in those horrible pictures on screen.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The situation should concern everyone and there is no one in the country who would not love to turn back the clock and ask if there might be another way out of the situation. The war is a reality, so how do we move on? That is what we should be debating in this House and wherever we get the opportunity. I am glad that the Minister of State and the Leader of this House have found time again to allow us air our views as to how we might move forward and alleviate the awful suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I saw a sickening clip on television very recently involving the notion of journalists being "embedded". Some are embedded with the coalition forces in distributing humanitarian aid, and when it was rejected, there was the appalling feeling that these people were throwing aid at the Iraqis as if this were the way to overcome rejection by them. The journalists were reflecting that view, and that nauseated me when I saw it on television. I felt it was not correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I use this opportunity to congratulate our own journalists, who are being very fair in their assessment of the situation. They are describing it as it is, and I welcome that because it shows up that some other journalists are not reading the situation as it should be read.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Another loss is the lack of faith in the United Nations. It is a shame that such a noble organisation has been undermined to such an extent. I recognise the good work Ireland has for a very long time done in supporting the United Nations and supporting humanitarian relief efforts. We know that Ireland always had a strong voice for the innocent victims. We all want to see an end to this war, and every day we hope for the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The British forces are, I think, trying to handle the situation and trying to integrate with the Iraqi people and build up the confidence that is lacking. They are trying to counteract the lack of trust between east and west, which is such a pity. We should be aiming to rebuild that confidence and trust, because there is the fear that it is "them" and "us", and the Iraqis as a proud nation do not want to be handed aid. They would rather die than accept it in this way, and I am very conscious of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The question is how we can liberate Iraq. There is no democracy there. We are trying to build the future of Iraq, to give them a sense of their own identity and nationalism, their sense of being. It is not going to be easy to get that message across, but that is our aim. We have the experience of Afghanistan, where we aimed to give out aid, and that of the various NGOs, including Concern and GOAL, which have distributed aid with sensitivity. It is only when we go about the task in that way that we will establish ourselves as the key people.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">There is a need to restore water and food supplies. I was reading about what cutting off the electricity links and public health services will mean regarding disease. Many urban dwellers have a huge fear that, unless we get those grids back in working order, it will lead to diseases such as typhoid and respiratory infections, with an impact on public health. It has been well quoted that the collapse of services would lead to a humanitarian disaster. Many children are at risk from death due to malnutrition.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">I congratulate the Government which is doing everything it can to provide moneys for UNICEF and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees for their global operations, which currently include Iraq. The Minister referred to a current allocation of €15 million which I hope will be earmarked with flexibility and given in such a way that it can be easily distributed among the people. Our problem is that the journalists who have taken on a pro-coalition role have destroyed it for those who wish to enter the country to hand out aid and best deliver our contributions to the people. Unless we can restore that confidence, dealing with the lack of trust, we will have no role, which worries me greatly.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">I wish the Minister of State well and congratulate him on his work in the hope that he will continue and that we will go on debating the issue to ensure Ireland is working in the field, making the public aware of the suffering and how best we can move forward on a humanitarian level. What we really want is the war to end, to rebuild Iraq and make it a sovereign state. We can only do this through our resources, calling in GOAL, Concern, the Red Cross and UNICEF among other organisations to try to alleviate the suffering. I do not know what else we can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I recently read a line in the newspaper that sickened me. An American soldier said, "I had to kill that chick because she was in my way." I could not believe what he had said. They have a role to play but I could not believe he would use such an insensitive line. Perhaps he did have to kill her but it was the way he said that turned me off. There must be another way of doing this. I do not want Saddam Hussein or the current situation to continue. I want a democratic country, young people to receive an education and enjoy freedom of expression in the same way we do. I want to give Iraq the same sense of identity as we have. We must keep fighting to ensure people in the eastern part of the world are aware that we are on their side. We are not against them, we want simply to liberate them. That is my message today. We can do this best on a humanitarian basis. I hope we will keep pushing this line to alleviate the suffering.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_372">This is a filthy and unjustifiable war. While I know he is a decent man who feels things keenly, the Minister of State mentioned the fact that, as we have just heard, a maternity hospital had been bombed. Are we now to be told that the babies in their incubators bombed themselves? This the kind of thing the Americans have been saying. With regard to this business of liberating people and giving them democracy, one cannot dump democracy from the sky on top of them in the form of a bomb. That is simply impossible, it must be grown from the base up. One cannot have instant solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">We see the growing militarisation of the idea of humanitarian aid, something I find absolutely revolting. On television last night I witnessed the obscene sight of a soldier enticing a terrified child with a bar of candy. Do the people doing this remember the way they carried on when Saddam Hussein stuck a British child on his knee? They are doing exactly the same and worse. It is a violation of the innocent, nothing else. With regard to the so-called liberation of Iraq, can one be liberated against one's will? That is complete and utter nonsense. Let us spell it out the way it is: it is a rape. Of course, the rapists are saying the victims provoked their lust and that, in any case, they will get to like it. That is the message of the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States. We hear the cry of the Iraqi people, at home in Iraq, here and in Britain. They ask, "Are we not human?" It is remarkable how many of them have used this phrase. They say, "Leave us alone and we will deal with Saddam in our own way."</p>
          <p eId="para_374">There is, as I said, an utterly cynical and degrading abuse of humanitarian aid. Food and water – hunger and thirst – are being used as instruments of war in the siege of towns such as Basra. The proof can be seen, We were told that people would come out and welcome them but the proof is that there has not been a single sign of this. We have, however, had some instructive elements such as the bombing of a water purification plant. It is totally cynical that agencies distributing food and water should be bombed by the axis of evil of the United Kingdom and the United States, only for them to then go in with their laughable humanitarian aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">What we are confronted with, in fact, is a totally imperialist situation. I know that the word "imperialist" used to be tossed around in student debates but this is imperialism. Look at the struggle between the various elements in the Bush Administration. Colin Powell's State Department put in a list of eight people, who included several former ambassadors to Arab states, to be involved in the presumptuous and arrogant administration of Iraq after the war but Donald Rumsfeld and the Pentagon put their pens through them all and instead are trying to give the posts to long-time supporters of regime change, such as James Wolsey, a former director of the CIA. What was the one they had earmarked for him? The answer is the Minister for Information in the new Iraqi Government. Can one imagine anything more Orwellian? This is 1984 20 years too late. They are going to impose a Government, and the Minister for Information representing the Iraqi people is going to be the American-based former director of the CIA. That is what we are dealing with in this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Let us look at the language used. I salute and thank Senator Ormonde for her sensitive speech but they are not the only phrases and they are very interesting. There was the British soldier who said the American airman who shot up his tank column was "a cowboy . out on a jolly."That is what we are dealing with in the American army. Let us have a few more quotes from <i>The Sunday Times</i>, one of Rupert Murdoch's newspapers: “The Iraqis are sick and we are the chemotherapy.” What does that tell one about the mentality of those troops? However, there is a progression. The next person quoted said, “I'd like to meet one of those friggin' Iraqis, I'd kill him.” The final quote is, “I'm sick of the war, I'd like to nuke that bloody town.” Perhaps they will because they are mad enough. George Bush is so thick that he seems to believe gas masks are weapons of mass destruction and chemical warfare. They present them on television and say, “We told you so.” Are the unfortunate Iraqis not to protect themselves? It reminds me of the time in this country when the British were bombing the hell out of O'Connell Street, and one of O'Casey's characters in the play said, “Do they want us to come out in our pelts and throw stones at them?”</p>
          <p eId="para_377">These are a dignified people. I was astonished that we even had Mo Mowlam saying it is dreadful, it is awful but we have got to bomb them out of it and end the war as quickly as possible. It is like a game show – I have started, so I will finish.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">It reminds me more of <i>Macbeth,</i> the play we studied for the intermediate certificate. The feeling expressed by Macbeth hangs like a pall over this:</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I am in blood</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Stepped in so far that, should I wade no</p>
          <p eId="para_381">more,</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Returning were as tedious as go o'er.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">That seems to be what Bush thinks.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Then we had the case at the road block at Najaf. We were told, in that wonderful American principle that Mr. Nixon gave to the world of "deniability", that they were responsible, that they did not stop and the soldiers fired warning shots. Now we know they did not because there was an embedded reporter from <i>The Washington Post</i> who has shown to the world that it was all lies. Seven or eight people, women and children, trying desperately to flee with all their worldly possessions, were blown to smithereens, and then they lie about it. It works because today I heard somebody on Joe Duffy's radio show say, “They shot a warning signal, they told them.” They did not. Do not insult us with these lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Then they handed out ten body bags and an offer of money. The brave people there were the poor unfortunate relatives who had the courage to go in and claim the mutilated bodies of their families and refuse the money, and I hope they spat in their faces while they did it.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Last night 33 women and children were obliterated. I would like to quote the shameful account of this, again from <i>The Irish Times</i>:</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Most of the dead are women and children, and have the sort of amputation wounds caused by cluster bombs, which are banned for use against civilians.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">"This was done by US cluster bombs," a British-trained doctor, Dr Nazem al-Adali, said, speaking to the camera. "I appeal to all my colleagues in Britain to do something to stop this."</p>
          <p eId="para_389">If the medical profession in this country have any decency, they will, to a single person, unite and demand a stop to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The Minister should summon the representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States to demand that the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium is stopped immediately. We are told, regarding these incidents at roadblocks, that they learnt from Northern Ireland. Is that music in the ears of this Irish Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_391">We should see these images. It is far too sanitised. I could not sleep last night after what I saw and heard – the poor unfortunate man taking up his mutilated baby and screaming, "This is my baby. They are cowards." Two young men were hiding and screaming with their keffiyeh over their heads. I saw it and I hope Bush saw it, and I hope he slept as little as I slept last night. We have to see these images.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">We have had this business about Shannon. Of course we are complicit. I have a record in human rights and if they are brought before a war crimes tribunal, with my record I will stand and give evidence that Ministers in this country were complicit in a war crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I salute the bravery of the British soldiers, those two wonderful young men who refused to fight and who are to face a court martial.</p>

It is totally disproportionate.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I mentioned <i>Macbeth</i>. I hope that somebody around Bush has the intelligence to reflect on Macbeth's bitter musings: “It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.” So it will, and it will be on our heads if at the very least the Minister does not, as I have asked, call in the ambassadors of the United Kingdom and the United States to tell them plainly what we think of the use of cluster bombs on civilian targets, of the blowing up of maternity hospitals.</p>

They cannot find the armaments factory or the gas equipment that they told us were there. They cannot find the rose blossoms which were to strew the path of the incoming invaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Unfortunately and sadly, the invaders, what the Minister called the "occupying forces", are getting there. There has to be a better way than seeing every evening the lined and stricken faces of women and children, old long before their time through hunger, deprivation, worry, loss, abandonment, puzzlement, wondering where they are going and what it is all about. They have absolutely no way of knowing. Their daily lives, from morning until night are one long series of bullets and bombs and a sense that they are bereft.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">We must reflect upon the news about the maternity hospital. We must reflect on the fact of women giving new life and the life being stripped away from them as soon as they give it. It is a most awful picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">We are here today to talk about humanitarian aid. I applaud the flexibility of the Minister in the way he talked about the unallocated funds and how they do it. He dwelt on this particular topic fleetingly, but he did dwell upon it. I find it obscene that it is military lorries that are bringing death and at the same time bringing food.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">That has to be the wrong way to do it, throwing it out as if they were the lord protectors who had come to protect the people of Basra and all of these towns, the names of which, along with the those of the rivers and the passwords, trip off our tongues as if we were daily familiar with them. There is something wrong about men and women in uniform giving out aid and having the bullet in the other hand. It has to be, as the Minister stated, the NGOs and the recognised agencies and the countries that are giving the humanitarian aid. In essence humanitarian aid in the hands of invaders is wrong and obscene.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">It is aggrandisement – there is no doubt about it. There is no other way to describe it. But what happens? Afghanistan was overtaken and there is, in its main city, a semblance of governance, but the rest of the country is as lawless as ever. Nobody wants Saddam Hussein, as Senator Ormonde stated, but if you talk like this you are somehow believed to be on his side. How could anybody be on the side of a tyrant who denies everything of democracy to all his people? There has to be another way which is better than a war, because at the end of the day war achieves nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I am no pacifist, but I know enough of life to know that jaw-jaw is better than war-war. There is a sense of people needing to take part in a great, heroic war effort. There is nothing heroic about war, about bombing civilians, about beating women into the ground or about killing children. There must be a better way. I applaud the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has given his heart and soul to humanitarian efforts. I am glad we have had the opportunity to discuss this matter today.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_411">If people are concerned – as are many Members of the House – about the humanitarian disaster looming in Iraq, they are obliged to demand immediately an end to the activity that is causing that disaster, namely, hostilities. I do not understand why a Government that claims it is neutral cannot say that this conflict should stop now. The British Government says that if we stop now, we will leave Saddam Hussein in power. Is that worse than letting the Iraqi people continue to suffer? Who are we to say that it is more important to eliminate the regime in Iraq than to end the agony of that country's people? If we are genuinely serious about humanitarian issues, we have an obligation to say that the best thing that can be done to alleviate the humanitarian disaster is to stop now.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The fact that people launched into an activity that is clearly both immoral and illegal does not permit us to avoid confronting the realisation that what was immoral and illegal when it began remains so and that the only thing changing is the scale of the horror. It is up to us and the Government to speak out.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I do not want to make a political issue out of this, but the view of this conflict has been fudged at Government level. The leader of Fine Gael believes the war is illegal and immoral and the Labour Party and its leader also believe that. The leader of Fianna Fáil in this House believes it, but we cannot get the Government to say that it believes the war is wrong. The reason for this is that we could not merely discuss the outcome of a war if we believe that the activity is illegal and immoral.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">It is not as if we have always found it difficult to make judgments about invasions. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, we knew what was our position, although our official position was neutral. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia – to drive out the most appalling regime the world had seen since Hitler, which killed perhaps 20% of its population, deliberately and callously, in the pursuit of a most profoundly savage ideology – we refused to recognise the new Government of that country. We persisted in recognising the tyranny of Pol Pot, for the best part of 20 years, in the interests of power politics. Let us not pretend that in our strategic interest we are not allowed to say what we think about major issues. I challenge the Government, as I have done on previous occasions, to say what it thinks about this war.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Of course the war is regrettable. Every single death of a human being – be it an Iraqi soldier, an American soldier, a British soldier or an innocent civilian – is regrettable. However, regret is a step away from conscience. My conscience is where I decide whether something is moral and my understanding of law is where I decide whether something is legal. The fundamental problem, which is infuriating Irish people, is the fact that the Government cannot bring itself to say whether its advice suggests that this activity is either moral or legal. I believe it is neither. As a result, there is no reason to believe that we can simply stand back and hope it ends quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">What is happening in Iraq is a war of aggression on the part of two countries. I know the Minister of State has much goodwill towards East Timor, but I was taken aback by his reference to it because just two weeks ago in <i>The Economist</i> there was a startlingly blunt assessment of the grab Australia has made for East Timor's natural resources. There is something sickeningly ironic about Australia involving itself in a war to liberate the people of Iraq, while it is also involved in the use of what is essentially brute force to impoverish the people of East Timor. It has withdrawn from the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and has withdrawn its acceptance of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in order to justify its illegal grabbing of the natural resources of East Timor, which, according to all international conventions, should be the property of the people of that country. I have no patience with that sort of crusading spirit, which lines up with the USA in Iraq halfway around the world while bullying its nearest neighbour. I do not believe we can accept the ethics, values or morality of a Government that behaves in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">I am concerned that discussion about humanitarian aid will become a smokescreen for many who want to avoid confronting the real issue, which, I reiterate, is the morality of this war. There is nothing unique about the brutality of what is happening in this war, nor about the massacre of civilians, including children. It happens in every war. The real moral challenge to the Governments of the USA and the UK and their puny ally in Australia is whether the slaughter they have accepted is necessary and morally justified by the aim they have in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I invite our Government, which claims to be a subscriber to international law and decency, to say whether it believes that this war is right. Not whether it is regrettable – of course it is – but whether it is justified. If it is illegal and immoral, then, regardless of the precedents 55 years ago, we should not allow our airports to be used to transport troops to participate in such a war.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I ask the Minister of State not to reply that the Attorney General said we were not involved in the war. I accept that as an interesting, casuistic, Jesuitical distinction, but what I want to know is whether, if the Government believes a war is immoral and illegal, it will still tolerate troops passing through on the basis of some vague – I emphasise the word "vague"– precedent. It was shameful to allow troops to pass through during the war on Vietnam, but it was a different era: we had a different view of the world and we were less informed about the brutalities that were taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Let us by all means weep for the children of Iraq. Of course we should do so. Let us also urge others to do likewise. However, humanitarian tears that ignore the moral obscenity being perpetrated against the people of Iraq have more to do with crocodiles than with compassion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Mr. M. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_421">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his comments on humanitarian aid, which is an issue we have discussed both at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">For some time I have been concerned about the UN Oil for Food Programme. The Minister of State referred to the fact that the UN, which had suspended this programme, has announced its recommencement. Having met people from the NGO, CARE, when I was in Baghdad at the end of January, I know the Oil for Food Programme was operated very efficiently. Some 16 million Iraqis, or 66% of a population of 27 million, depended on the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Much depended on people being able to get to the depots from their houses to collect the food. Since the war started, I have been wondering how people have been able to collect the food rations available and bring them home. Earlier today, I spoke to a girl from Iraq who has been studying and working in Ireland for 12 years. I met her parents when I visited Iraq. She confirmed there was a difficulty with people collecting their rations. She also mentioned that refugees have always had huge difficulty getting to the borders with Jordan, Turkey and Syria because of the huge cost of transport. Unfortunately, the borders have been closed in recent times and it is very difficult for people to reach those countries. That is one of the practical issues that has arisen.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">At yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Chairman, Deputy Woods, proposed a motion on the political and humanitarian situation in Iraq. He rightly stated that the United Nations should do everything in its power to ensure that the stability of the region is maintained and that there will be no extension of hostilities outside the boundaries of Iraq. He referred also to the fact that there is a road map for peace and security in the Middle East. The representatives of NGOs who attended the meeting said the United Nations should provide assistance and it was not acceptable for this to be done by the military. John O'Shea referred to the militarisation of food provision and I agree that this is a matter of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The joint committee also discussed sanctions. On a number of occasions I have referred to the need to end sanctions as soon as practicable. It is obscene that military trucks are bringing in food when water supplies are being bombed. Water supply is key, but we are not allowed to provide chlorine to Iraq to assist in the purification of water. The lack of decent water supplies is one of the biggest issues in Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">We should learn something about human rights in Iraq. President Saddam Hussein has obviously abused his position. I condemn the fact that while members of the Baath Party receive preferential treatment, he has abused the Kurds and the Marsh Arabs.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Great work was done on the peace process in Northern Ireland and in South Africa in setting up the truth and reconciliation commission. We received – I hope we are still getting it – help towards the peace process in Northern Ireland. Representatives from the Seanad travelled to South Africa to monitor elections and look at the political process there. This sort of assistance should be available to the people of Iraq and the people of the Middle East. We should not dismiss the proposal made by Senator O'Toole yesterday to send politicians to provide assistance in Iraq. There are reporters from Ireland in Iraq and in neighbouring countries who are doing an excellent job. There are also doctors and nurses from Ireland, many of whom I have met, working there. The politicians should also provide assistance by visiting the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I congratulate the Minister of State on what the Government has done in terms of the provision of food. He mentioned that the UN has stockpiles of food, medicines and supplies of essential equipment in countries in the vicinity of Iraq. Those need to be made available as quickly as possible for the sake of the refugees and the innocent citizens in Iraq.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_429">Clearly Saddam Hussein is a dangerous leader. He is a military dictator in charge of a large country and he wants to have weapons of mass destruction, although no evidence has been shown to date that he possesses them. Two weeks ago, President Bush stated that the US and Britain would have a quick military success and that Iraq would be liberated. However, the war has gone on for a fortnight and there is no end in sight. What is happening in Iraq at present is very sad. As stated previously, all wars are bad and they bring much death and destruction wherever they take place. The inevitable loss of life of men, women and children is the saddest result of any war.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Leaders from all over Europe, and particularly from neutral countries such as Ireland, need to display their leadership by speaking out courageously against this war. Any days of war are evil days and this is something we have recognised in the past. History has written about the evil days of war and it is no different today from what we learnt in our history classes at school. The majority of Irish people are opposed to this war and we have a duty towards those we represent to try to bring some realisation of what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">We should be outraged at the level of military expenditure by the US and Britain at a time when famine is rampant in Africa and other parts of the world. If we are true friends of the American people, we must tell them of our concern that war achieves nothing but misery. There are many other ways of getting rid of a dictator. Ultimately, people power is what counts. If people rise up and they have the confidence and the support of all right-minded nations, they will eventually get rid of a dictator.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I have visited America on two occasions since Christmas. In general, its citizens are kind and generous but they are being conned by President Bush. Last night I spoke to friends in New York who are seeing a different side of the war in Iraq to that which we are seeing here. It is regrettable that people in the American media, who no doubt care about standards in the profession, are simply being used to deliver false information to the world. This was particularly evident when I spoke to my friends in America. It is being done through a system of censorship that applies to most journalists working in Iraq at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">We hear about the so-called embedded journalists but they are referred to more on US television networks such as Fox News where they are most prevalent. These journalists come from all the major television and radio stations and newspapers and are officially part of the American and British war units in Iraq. They travel into action with the military and what they report is strictly controlled by the military, which means that the information the public gets from such reporters is largely propaganda. This is the annoying thing about the modern media, but thankfully there are also many good independent journalists working in Iraq, some of whom are from Ireland. I compliment them on a good job – they publish the truth, which is paramount in this situation. I am glad we have people who stand up to the mouthpieces of Bush in this State and other EU countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I compliment GOAL, Concern, Trócaire and the many other agencies working for those afflicted by the war. It is important that we support these organisations because all right-minded people in a nation that has suffered should see that the ordinary decent people of Iraq are looked after and supported in every way possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LabhrasOMurchu" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_435">It is in the nature and tradition of Ireland to be at the forefront in any humanitarian mission in any part of the world and Iraq will be no exception. We are particularly fortunate to have Deputy Tom Kitt as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs. I hope he does not mind my saying so, but I have been observing him for some time and have been impressed by his work.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I am glad this debate is taking place and I support what the Leader said initially. I made the same point in the House on the occasion of our last debate on Iraq. I would love to see a united front by the Seanad, the Dáil and the people, reaching the common ground on this matter, which I believe there is, even though there may be peripheral issues upon which we disagree. It is always a privilege to be able express one's views in this House openly and honestly. However, with that privilege comes responsibility and accountability to oneself, the electorate and ultimately to all people.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Many of us have wrestled with our consciences on this issue for some time and there is no doubt that it can be a burden. That same conscience-grappling should apply to both ends of the spectrum. In that context, I agree with the words of a churchman who said: "Those who have laid aside the diplomatic role and have gone to war have taken on a huge responsibility in the face of God, in the face of their consciences and in the face of history."</p>
          <p eId="para_438">It is particularly important for us to be able to express our views openly. Most of us are trying to seek out a logic and rationale for this. We are reading every piece of literature we can get, listening to radio programmes and watching television programmes. We are questioning our own biases, prejudices and partisanship and still, I believe, we are dealing with an immoral, unjust and illegal war. Of that I have no doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">While reading through various articles, I came across the following piece in last Saturday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> which illustrates the difficulty in trying to make sense of what is happening:</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Let us scroll back a decade to the post-mortems which followed the liberation of Kuwait. Try to guess who said this –"The Gulf War was a limited-objective war. If it had not been, we would be ruling Baghdad today – an unpardonable expense in terms of money, lives lost and ruined regional relationships."? The same person went on to deliver the following insights into America's attitude to Iraq –"There are those who have asked why President Bush did not order our forces on to Baghdad after we had driven the Iraqi army out of Kuwait. We must assume that the political objective of such an order would have been capturing Saddam Hussein. Even if Hussein had waited for us to enter Baghdad and even if we had been able to capture him, what purpose would it have served and would serving that purpose have been worth the many more casualties that would have occurred? Would it have been worth the inevitable follow-up: major occupation forces in Iraq for years to come and a very expensive and complex American proconsulship in Baghdad? Fortunately for America, reasonable people at the time thought that and still do." That was Colin Powell.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">We listen to the theory and logic from the spokespersons and place it against what we know to be true and correct, yet we can find no logic. What is certain is that looking at the shattered bodies of men, women and children should bring us to our senses. A news item on the radio this morning reported that the media had been allowed to get close to the latest civilian casualties in Iraq. The journalist said that the scene was so bad it was said it would never be shown on television. That is a pity. I would show it on television and place it against the hypocritical diplomacy and its accompanying words and let ordinary people make up their own minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I find it utterly obscene that bombs – which are neither smart nor directed – are dropped and kill civilians by the hundred, while those civilians are told they are being liberated and are expected to garland and welcome as liberators those who have come to kill them and devastate their lives. The reason I make this point is that they may win this battle – for that is all it is – but there is no way they can win this war. That is because it extends way beyond the end of the present hostilities and there is no way there can ever be understanding between the people and those who have done this to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">We have an opportunity to cry "halt" and we must do so. We have an opportunity to ask sane minds to focus on this issue but we will not achieve anything by dividing, making this a political issue or being party political about it. I have made these same points before and a journalist from <i> The Irish Times</i> rang me two days later to ask if I had been admonished by Fianna Fáil for saying what I had. I said that I have been in the Seanad for six years and have always been allowed to express my views openly and honestly. Many Fianna Fáil and Government Members agree with me. That type of targeting is unhelpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">I accept that we must focus on the humanitarian issues. However, as the Leader said, it is difficult to see a situation where, after devastating a country, the same trucks bring in humanitarian aid. It is important that neither the UK nor the US has any role in this. One of the most obscene images recently broadcast from Iraq was that of a truck pulling up, its tailboard let down and starving people being forced to fight. That was no accident, it was trying to give the impression that the people were welcoming them even though, in their hearts, the people hated them. It is particularly important, therefore, that we work through the independent agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">We should not presume that this war will end in a certain way and let our policies be dictated by that presumption. We should take it for granted that if only one person believes there is a righteous approach in a time like this, that person will convince others. I will try to get inside the minds of the one in three people in Ireland who support the war and the minds of the one in four people who support what President Bush is doing. It will be difficult, but my main job will be to convince the one person in three – I will omit the political aspect of convincing the one in four – that there is no justification for this war. It should end now. The troops should come back and let us return to the diplomatic road.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_167">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_446">I acknowledge the Minister of State's commitment to this issue. The justification for this war is nil. I was one of the doctors who wrote a letter against this war to <i>The Irish Times</i>. I said that I regretted the fact that Ireland allowed the troops to go through Shannon. I doubt that it would make much difference if we stopped the troops passing through, but, unfortunately, our attitude will now be aligned with that of America. Given the great name we had in the past in terms of the distribution of humanitarian aid, I hope our workers will not be put in a situation of greater danger because of the flights into Shannon. I am sure the Government would not want that to happen, but it is a possibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">For Prime Minister Blair's sake, I hope that anthrax is found by the tonne. I do not mean just a few flasks of it. He has stated that it exists in Iraq. Unless it is revealed by the tonne, I will not believe it was there. If there are just a few litres, I will not believe that they could not have been brought in. There are numerous laboratories in America where anthrax is available. It is the only country where there has been a problem with anthrax in recent years. If Prime Minister Blair is to have any credibility, anthrax and some chemical agents had better be found by the tonne.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Minister and other Senators have mentioned the bombing of the Red Crescent maternity hospital. This is the last straw. In the past ten years, as I have said previously in the House, the maternal and infant mortality figures in Iraq have risen to an appalling level as a result of the sanctions imposed on that country. The maternal mortality figure for 2000 was 370 per 100,000 births. In this country the figure is eight and it might include car accidents, cancer and other causes. Even worse, before 1990 the figure was about half that. This is a serious situation. The country has been in a humanitarian crisis during the past ten to 12 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The infant mortality rate, that is, the death rate per 1,000 live births, was 100 in 1997; that is one in ten children. The mortality rate for children under five years of age per 1,000 was 120. Before 1990, the figures were about half that level and it was expected that by 1997 the infant mortality rate in Iraq would be about 37 per 1,000 live births. Instead it has trebled. The Iranian figures were always much worse than those in Iraq. The Iranian infant mortality rate in 1997 was down to 38 and by 2000 it was down to 33. The Iranians have improved enormously, even though they are in the same part of the world. The Iranian figures were always worse so one can see how seriously affected the civilian Iraqi population has been by the sanctions. We all tried to do something, but we did not do enough. There is no more or less to it than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs and our representatives on the Security Council did everything they could to try to prevent this war. The small countries of the world which are members of the international organisations have huge obligations to deal with the outrageous desire for power of some major countries. They will have to try to build up these organisations again.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I agree that it will have to be international organisations that distribute humanitarian aid. It was outrageous to see those poor people clawing for food out of the back of a lorry. Giving sweets to Iraqi children does not do much good either. Maura Quinn, the executive director of UNICEF Ireland, is a friend of mine. She wrote the following to me on 31 March:</p>
          <p eId="para_452">My last visit to Iraq was in February, when there was a sense of dread about the future. Iraq is truly the saddest country I have ever visited. I have witnessed its continuing decline from a thriving nation to a place where children are dying from malnutrition and preventable disease. And now war is going to devastate an already crumbling nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Currently UNICEF has 160 Iraqi staff in Baghdad with a further 90 national staff in other parts of Iraq and along the borders. The remaining non-Iraqi staff will return to the country as soon as it is safe to do so. Although conditions are very difficult and are changing from day to day, UNICEF staff have been able to carry out their work in the past few days, including getting supplementary food to children who are isolated in institutions outside Baghdad.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">There is an enormous number of homeless children who rely on people such as UNICEF workers to bring them food. Ms Quinn also stated that:</p>
          <p eId="para_455">UNICEF has been working in Iraq since 1983 and is currently the main humanitarian agency, along with the Red Cross, with our focus being on children. UNICEF has been given particular responsibility for nutrition, health and water and sanitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">We have heard about civilian casualties from the various bombing raids, massacres at checkpoints and so forth, but the American public has not. American television stations carry different reports of the war from those carried in Europe. I refer, in particular, to the fine reports we get from RTE. My husband has just returned from the United States and he told me the reporting is not the same. Even Fox News and Sky News, both of which are owned by Rupert Murdoch, have a different brand of reporting for their different audiences. It is no wonder that the American public is giving support to President Bush.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">If people have contacts in America, it is important that we tell them our views. Senator Ó Murchú is right about explaining our objections to people in Ireland. We also have an obligation to explain them to our friends abroad.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_458">I compliment the Minister of State on his passion and commitment on behalf of the Government to humanitarian relief, not only in Iraq but also worldwide. Looking at the statistics he outlined to the House, one can see the great endeavours undertaken by this small nation to provide humanitarian relief in so many countries. Long may that continue. It is the proud tradition of this country and Members of the House should salute the Government and the Minister of State for continuing that tradition and commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">In recent days, Members have had opportunities to deliver effective soundbites on the Order of Business. They are selective soundbites and one can be as selective as one wishes when discussing the situation in Iraq. This debate gives Members an opportunity to flesh out their arguments and try to get a sense of balance. I thank the Leader for organising this debate to allow that process unfold.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">There is no doubt that war is evil and I do not know of anyone who supports it. Reference was made to statistics which show that one in three or one in four people support the war, but I have yet to meet anyone who advocates it. It is easy to talk about the rights and wrongs of war when one does not have to make the ultimate decision to engage in military action. As we have seen on television in recent days, the consequences of military action are quite horrific and, unfortunately, it looks as if we will see more of the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">The pillars of power comprise the principles of diplomacy, information, military action and economic sanctions. In the Iraqi situation, diplomacy has been ongoing for a number of years. We should not forget that, as part of the 1991 ceasefire agreement, Saddam Hussein was given 15 days to co-operate fully with the international community. Some 12 years and 17 UN resolutions later, he has still failed to comply.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I would have preferred if this war had not taken place. I supported the build-up of troops in the Middle East in the hope that the show of force would bring people to their senses. Equally, I had hoped that any action would be taken under a UN mandate, backed by a Security Council resolution, but, unfortunately, that was not to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">In an effort to bring some balance to the debate, however, I want to join the "what if?" brigade. We must ask what if action had been taken earlier, what if we had taken action in the Balkans, what if the EU and the UN had not procrastinated as much on these international issues and what would the result have been if they had not stood idly by? In yesterday's newspapers, we saw some of the 8,000 bodies – victims of that tragic day in Srebrenica – being prepared for reburial. The Americans later took action there when the UN had failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">There is an ongoing issue concerning the operation of the UN and its failure to take decisions based on collective responsibility. We have seen that occur in the past few weeks with regard to the situation in Macedonia, which I highlighted in the House recently. As a nation, we now find ourselves in the unique position where we cannot participate in that peacekeeping operation. I hope we will be able to discuss that matter again.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">What should we do now regarding Iraq? The greatest role we can play is in the area of humanitarian aid. Some of the examples highlighted by previous speakers are correct, including the fact that the UN has to take a major role in this matter. I fully endorse the Minister of State's commitment to having NGOs involved in relief operations. It should not be the role of a military force to do so, but in the early days of the conflict there has been no alternative. We have to get food in there and that is being done initially by the military force. However, the UN and the NGOs will have to, as far as is possible, become involved. The Government must fully support every effort to bring that about. From day one of the conflict, we ensured that we would have an active role in the relief effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I was very taken by a BBC 2 television documentary last week which featured interviews with Kurdish people. In particular, one elderly gentleman said, "Even if we were to lose half of our population and I were to be one of them, I would welcome that so as the other half could live in peace and not under the barbaric rule of Saddam Hussein." We cannot forget the 11 year old child who waved at American troops and was hanged within one hour for doing so. We cannot forget either the people trying to leave Basra who were mortared by their own troops. We can be selective and some may say that is western propaganda and is not true. However, the information war is part of the conflict and media input is used as a tool of war. The new era of embedded journalists is part of that tool. It will be left to historians to decide in future who was right or wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">We are facing an international conflict of cultures following the rise of fundamental Islamic elements in the western world in recent years. Whether we like it, 11 September 2001 was a catalyst for this conflict between cultures. We have to decide whether to sit in our armchairs and continue procrastinating or ask why we did not stand up earlier to stop this. We must cross-check every course of military action against whether it corrects the wrongs and injustices in this world. There are serious question marks over American foreign policy in certain areas. To be effective in a war against terrorism and rogue states, one must match it with proactive action to correct the wrongs and injustices in the Middle East, particularly in the Palestinian conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Ireland must be proactive on the international stage in terms of the provision of humanitarian relief. I know we are already proactive, but we have to be even more so now. Our role in the United Nations represents a proud tradition of service and I urge the Minister of State to continue his good efforts in that regard. We also have to try to get diplomacy working again, but we should not lose sight of the multinational force that went into Beirut in the early 1980s. That force failed and eventually had to be replaced by the UN. There is, therefore, a precedent for a multinational force being replaced by a UN operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">No one knows whether the war in Iraq will end quickly, but it does not look like doing so at present. Despite the atrocities that have been highlighted on television, restraint has been shown. If the allied forces were to unleash all the power available to them, there would be far more casualties and the war would be over far more quickly. However, restraint is being shown. The types of atrocities we are now witnessing are both a cause and a consequence of war.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I congratulate the Minister of State on his efforts. We should move forward in playing an active role in providing humanitarian assistance, as well as encouraging dialogue between the parties to this conflict to bring it to a conclusion as quickly as possible. We must not lose sight of the information war or the real wishes of the majority of the Iraqi people.</p>

        <speech by="#FeargalBrowne" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_471">This war is already taking longer than originally planned. We were led to believe that it was going to be over very quickly, but the timescale has now changed completely and both the British and American media are saying it could continue for an awfully long time. There is much more involved than appeared to be the case initially. It is frightening to think that 120,000 extra troops are on the way to Iraq as we speak. I agree with Senator Minihan that, as the war is now on, we must deal with the facts. It would defeat logic for the US and British forces to pull out of Iraq at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I firmly believe that history repeats itself, but I hope that is not so in this case. We were told lately that 12 years ago the then coalition forces were within two days of capturing Saddam Hussein. One can think of all the pain and suffering that could have been saved had they proceeded. The US general in charge at that time pulled back, even though he wanted to go ahead. President Bush senior would not let him as he believed that the Iraqi people would topple Saddam Hussein because he was so weakened, but unfortunately it did not work out that way. Not alone did he survive but he came back worse than ever. There is no benefit whatsoever in the forces pulling back. All we can hope for is a quick and successful war and the removal of Saddam Hussein.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">We cannot leave the Iraqi people exposed as they were last time. We saw the disbelief and hurt of the people in southern Iraq who rose against Saddam having been left high and dry when the coalition forces pulled out, but then Saddam got his revenge on them. It is not hard to understand why they would be somewhat sceptical and cynical of the coalition forces there now. It is in everyone's interest that we remove Saddam Hussein from his role in Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">I question the comments of the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, today when he spoke about Iraq being ruled by Iraqis. That is a simplistic approach. Iraq is made up of many ethnic groups and the question remains as to which group will be in charge. I regret that was not planned in advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I also question the role of the US and Britain in the provision of humanitarian aid. I am of the view that if a person creates a mess, that person should also clean it up. It is not good enough that the US, which over-rode the UN, should look to the UN to bail out Iraq in terms of the provision of humanitarian aid and its rebuilding. The US has an important role to play in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I am cynical and sceptical of the Government's commitment to foreign aid because it cut the foreign aid budget in its term of office. Senator Minihan spoke about tradition in terms of foreign aid, but the Government's tradition in this area is certainly questionable.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I was delighted to hear some colleagues speak about organising a delegation to visit Iraq in the future. I am aware of the difficulties that would present, but it was an idea I suggested two or three weeks ago when we spoke on this issue. That would be well worth doing, especially in light of the high level of propaganda presented day in day out whether in the newspaper or on television stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">RTE should be complimented on its balanced presentation of the facts. It is hard to digest all the information. This morning one of the English newspapers carried a story that Saddam Hussein was on the way out, that he was wounded, but we do not know if that is the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">It is hard to know what is the position. We saw horrific images of the innocent victims of war last night. The only way we can justify this war is by having Saddam removed. All we can hope for is a quick and speedy conclusion to this war. I share Senator Minihan's view of people who support war, but we need war every so often to remove evil tyrants like Saddam Hussein.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this matter. I look forward to Ireland's playing a positive and constructive role in the provision of humanitarian aid, an area in which we have played a fantastic role.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_483">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I find a good deal to support in what Senator Browne said, but I stop short of endorsing his scepticism about the bone fides of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">All war is filthy – we all know that. The first casualty of war is truth and we just labour on from that. We are in danger of almost canonising Saddam Hussein by having produced an anti-hero in the form of the American President. That is a terrible position for us to get ourselves into.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The innocent Iraqi people have suffered and they will suffer more. What is important is to bring that suffering to an end as quickly as possible. That will not be effected simply by telling people to stop in their tracks now and return home.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Senator Norris talked about the spirit of Macbeth. There is another Shakespearean character who boasted, "I can call spirits from the vasty deep," to which the response was:</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Why, so can I, or so can any man;</p>
          <p eId="para_488">But will they come when you do call for</p>
          <p eId="para_489">them?</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Ours is a small voice and we do not want to imagine that it can be magnified to that extent on the world stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Let us imagine what would happen if the war stopped now. This is an aspect of Senator Browne's analysis which I found quite telling. The Minister of State indicated the plight of the Iraqi people, how their standard of living had fallen. It had fallen for two reasons, one being the regime under which they were living and the second, to which Senator Henry referred, is due to the United Nations sanctions, to which we all subscribed. The sanctions were the result of the regime. The other cause of their immediate and terrible suffering is the war.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">I agree with Senator Browne that the last Gulf War stopped about a week too soon without achieving its objective. Simply to stop things now and leave people in the hands of a corrupt regime would not effect any great improvement. Apart from praying for a rapid end to the war, for the minimisation of casualties and for as little destruction as possible of the infrastructure, we need to use whatever influence we have to ensure that a humanitarian programme is put in place under the aegis of the United Nations and the EU rather than a military or an imperial occupation.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Reference was made to the fact that there were two American shadow governments waiting to move in, one from the State Department and the other from the Pentagon. That could only be disastrous. This needs to be considered in the wider geopolitical sense. Attention needs to be paid to the running sore of Israel and Palestine. I hope the Minister of State can redouble his efforts in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">There is an immediate need for relief. I, like many Members, find it difficult to imagine the armalite and the bread-basket coming in together, but it may be the only way. I would rather see people getting water from soldiers than getting no water. It is important for the relief programme to be managed by the NGOs and they may well need the logistical support of armies in order to do so, owing to the need to shift vast quantities of food. Then there is the question of developing the capacity of the Iraqi people to set up administrations for themselves. There is a need to build up the infrastructure and, on the longer scale, to help restore democratic institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">The one great advantage is that Iraq was a developed nation before Saddam Hussein came to power. It has great resources of oil and it should be one of the better off nations in the world. Iraqis are educated, with a long tradition and a fine culture. It is important that is respected and the Government, with other governments in the United Nations, does its best to ensure that the future of Iraq is in the hands of the Iraqi people and that all necessary assistance is given to them.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_499">I welcome the Minister of State and his efforts regarding aid which he outlined. The Government and some Fine Gael Senators seem ambiguous about or at least resigned to the war. The war may be taking place but it is still wrong and unacceptable. It is still illegal and Ireland must make a stand in that regard. We need further debate on this aspect of the war, which is also relevant to the debate on the humanitarian consequences. It is war which causes the need for aid. The war poses a risk to the stability of the world in addition to the risks it poses to the lives of Iraqis.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The Minister of State mentioned the Oil for Food Programme and my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has pointed out the difficulties for Iraqis in accessing that aid. He said the best way to bring in humanitarian aid is to end the war. Ireland can take the initiative at Security Council level by seeking intervention from that body to end the war. I also support Deputy Higgins's comments requiring the examination of compliance with the fourth Geneva Convention regarding damage to infrastructure needed for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">I agree with the Minister of State and other speakers who said we should object to the militarisation of aid. I also agree that aid should be provided through UN organisations and NGOs. We must ensure that aid is not abused but gets to the people who need it. There should be no diversion of aid from other programmes; the money provided should be additional funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The outcome of this conflict must be in the interests of the world and the Iraqi people and not in the interests of the superpowers. The Government must stand up for the reinstatement of the pre-eminence of the UN and for a global approach to the interests of the world in general, not for a world order determined by superpowers. We must work for a fairer world, both in development and in the way the world is divided economically, in order to prevent future conflicts. We should also work on our relationships with countries in the Middle East and elsewhere, building fair, balanced relationships.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_503">I thank Senator Tuffy for giving me a minute of her time. I will not dwell on the military situation, past or present, but I make a plea to the Government based on some of the views of Senators Tuffy and Maurice Hayes. When this is over, in so far as that is possible, the future of Iraq should be in the hands of the Iraqi people and not in the hands of the United States. That is not a judgment but there are already ominous signs in the past few days that the Iraqi people, not just the United Nations, will be bypassed.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The Government has been relatively silent on this issue and maybe with good reason. However, it has some influence on the United States because of the huge numbers of Americans who claim Irish ancestry and loyalty. Most Irish people have great reservations about or are actively hostile to the actions of the United States. The Government should warn the United States that this is the situation among those numbered as their greatest friends. That may not be possible without causing great difficulties but it can be done silently and behind closed doors. I do not expect the Government to tell us about this in an open forum, nor do I expect a response to this plea. However, there are diplomatic channels which can be used without making an exhibition of ourselves. I plead with the Government to make those views, which are almost unanimous in the Seanad, known to the United States Government in whatever way is open to it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_505">War is obviously regrettable in any circumstances and we have seen why in the current conflict in Iraq. War should be a last resort but that was not the situation here, as there was still time for the arms inspectors to carry on their inspections. Though that might ultimately have led to war it would have meant all avenues were exhausted, which was not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Senator Ryan stated that the leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party said the war was illegal and he prompted the Government to do likewise. Such a statement would be highly irresponsible. That is not for the Government to determine – there are international bodies which can determine such issues. However, the conduct of the war is a matter for scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Some of those involved in the conflict have said on television that should the Iraqi generals use chemical weapons they would be held accountable for war crimes. That should happen but the allied conduct of the war should also be open to such scrutiny. If there is indiscriminate bombing or shooting, then such actions must be subsequently justified to establish whether or not crimes have been committed. It is inevitable to an extent that there will be civilian casualties but Kofi Annan put it cogently when he said there was a duty on belligerents on all sides to ensure the civilian population is protected. One gets the impression that this is not happening to the extent we would like.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Serious issues arise in the context of the aftermath of the war, such as humanitarian requirements. I compliment the Minister of State on his interest in this area. It is imperative the United Nations plays a pivotal role here. It is reprehensible to see arguments behind the scenes between Britain and the US about who will be awarded contracts to rebuild Iraq while the country is still being demolished on a nightly basis. If the reconstruction is to have any credibility then international bodies must play a role.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">It is imperative that certain events occur in the aftermath of the war. First, there must be a genuine effort to resolve the conflict between the Palestinians and Israel. It is noteworthy that the Israelis have ignored many UN resolutions. The rules regarding the operation of the UN must apply fairly across the globe and must be seen to do so. Also, the issue of weapons of mass destruction was instrumental in the instigation of the war. If such weapons are not discovered then serious questions will be raised as to the war being initiated.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">It is necessary to strengthen both the UN and the EU. World order should be policed and I acknowledge the US has played a role in this area when other countries were reluctant or unable to do so. However, it cannot be done on a unilateral basis. The international community must adjudicate on what action should be taken in such policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">There are many similar rogue dictators in various jurisdictions across the world in which the populations are oppressed to the same or an even greater degree than the people of Iraq. One of my concerns about the conduct of the war is that it will encourage some of these dictators to develop nuclear weapons to protect themselves because they do not have sufficient might to do so by other means. We recently saw tensions between India and Pakistan, both of which possess nuclear weapons. The prevention of nuclear proliferation must take place on an international basis.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_515">I thank Senators for their contributions. I want the issue of the humanitarian situation in Iraq to remain on the political and public agendas. This debate has been helpful in that regard. I thank Senators for giving strong support to the work we are doing. We will continue to play a role in meeting the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. As many Senators noted, this country is good at fulfilling this kind of role and our non-governmental organisations enjoy a tremendous reputation and have always been held in high regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Senators Maurice Hayes and Ross raised the important issue of the role of the Iraqi people in the reconstruction process. I agree they must be empowered and enabled to rebuild their own country. Our focus is firmly fixed on the important principle that the United Nations must be the central actor in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">Senators rightly raised the issue of access, which was also raised by NGOs during a meeting with me last week and at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. Safe access and a safe environment are vital if NGOs and other agencies are to do their work properly. I will pursue this objective in all my contacts.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">I share the view of Senators on the quality of the output of Irish journalists. The role of the media in this conflict is important and has been commented on extensively. I share the cynicism about the so-called embedded journalists. We have to be discerning about where the truth lies when watching some of their television reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">We are all agreed on the need to look to the future in order to ensure the humanitarian effort is delivered in a neutral and impartial manner. We must also ensure the recovery process is designed taking into account all the lessons learned in places such as Afghanistan, East Timor and Kosovo. The Iraqi people must be central to the future of their country. I fully concur that Iraq cannot become an oil well for the West.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I have made my feelings known on the important issue of the militarisation of aid, which I discussed in my earlier contribution. It is the wrong tactic in every respect. I share the concerns expressed by Senator Tuffy about the recommencement of the Oil for Food Programme. As the programme was operated by more than 40,000 Iraqis, it will be very difficult to get the delivery system operational again during the ongoing conflict. The United Nations Secretary General believes the United Nations can make a difference in this respect and I hope it can. The Senator is correct to point out that this is not a simple issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The issues of the legality of the war and the use of Shannon Airport have been well rehearsed and debated and are unlikely to disappear. However, Senators have recognised that I have a special responsibility for development co-operation and my role is to accept the reality that the war is now raging and focus my energies on the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">As Senator Ó Murchú stated, the spirit of all the contributions today has been one of trying to find common ground. This has been helpful. We have an enviable reputation for the extent and quality of our emergency response. I now have a duty to work with UN agencies and NGOs to deliver the highest quality aid, as has been the case in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">On the media reporting of the war, I agree with Senators that some of the reports we have seen are sickening and, like many Senators, find it difficult to watch some of them. The voices of reason sometimes appear to be muted. Again, however, I will not deviate from the job in hand. We will do everything possible to assist the innocent victims of this conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Senator Jim Walsh and others referred to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, correctly stating it requires immediate and urgent attention and a very clear focus by the international community. Ireland has a strong tradition of involvement in the region and we will play our part in developments. Incidentally, the matter will be raised in the other House later this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The overseas aid budget was mentioned. We have a strong tradition in development assistance. This year's budget is approximately €30 million more than last year, making it the largest in the history of the programme. The House will agree that if €30 million constitutes a cut at a time of considerable pressures on public finances, many Ministers would welcome similar cuts in their budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">I thank Senators for their co-operation during the debate. Despite the divergence in views, Senators, like Deputies in the other House, have made a genuine effort to come together to do what the Oireachtas does best. I will do my utmost not to let down the House or the nation in the important weeks ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_540">and</p>
          <p eId="para_541">(ii) accelerating the studies of professional services, which were initiated by the Competition Authority at the request of the Government on foot of the OECD review of Ireland's regulatory regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">I extend a warm welcome to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and thank her for taking time from her extremely busy schedule to discuss this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">We decided to table the motion to highlight the work of the Competition Authority. In recent years there has been a growing trend towards removing many of the tools of economic policy from the hands of national policy makers and placing them within the responsibility of transnational organisations. Interest rates are now set in Frankfurt and the annual budget is drawn up within the guidelines set down in a European Union pact. A key area in which national economic policy can make a difference is overseeing the competitive environment for business. The Competition Authority was established in 1991 as a statutory body with a specific role to enforce our competition law which is designed to protect and benefit the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Greater competition in the economy stimulates innovation and efficiency among business, enables consumers to buy goods and services at the best possible price and enhances overall national competitiveness. A competitive economy provides a basis for increasing productivity and living standards. In the long term it is also the most important policy tool for holding down inflation. This is a competitive process which the Competition Authority is committed to safeguarding in the interests of the consumer, businesses and the economy in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">It is very much in keeping with the Minister's philosophy that the Competition Authority is working very well as an independent statutory authority. In carrying out its commitment to oversee and promote competition in the market, the authority has published a number of reports providing clear, sometimes disturbing and often surprising findings. It recently announced the publication of its annual report for 2002 which reveals the first promising indications of increased output arising from improved public investment in competition. It also highlights the resolution of many important investigations without resort to litigation, as well as information on two criminal investigations, 56 summonses and 18 searches which were carried out by the authority during the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The Competition Authority has also signalled its determination to aggressively tackle anti-competitive practices in the economy. This has already been demonstrated in sectors such as telecommunications and air travel, but it has also become the authority's responsibility to put certain sectors in which competition is less evident under the microscope. To that end, the findings of a specially commissioned report on competitive practices in eight professions was made public. The study examined the activities of doctors, dentists, accountants, veterinary surgeons, architects, engineers, solicitors and barristers. Those findings are interesting and worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Of the eight professions studied, the authority found the most serious anti-competitive practices in the legal profession and in medicine. The regulation of these areas restricts entry and competition through a variety of mechanisms. One example is the legal profession, where all solicitors qualify from a course run by the Law Society and all barristers from one organised by the Kings Inns. Another is the limited number of places in medical schools and some of the restrictions placed in the way of doctors educated elsewhere who seek to work here.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The authority also included a number of recommendations in its report. For example, it is stated that removing the restriction on some professionals forming limited companies could increase investment in the provision of services such those of a primary health care nature. There is no doubt we would like to see increased investment in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Furthermore, the authority found that the limitations on places in medical schools reduced competition in this sector. The authority was able to identify a number of areas to be improved in the sector, which could result in facilitating the creation of new general practitioner practices and allowing them to respond to market demands. Using the research as a foundation, the authority has plans to issue individual reports on competition in each profession on a phased basis. If appropriate, the authority will seek changes to existing practices or offer regulatory guidelines to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The result of anti-competitive practices in industry is clear. Those involved in the business make higher profits and the consumer pays more. For this reason, anti-competitive practices can no longer be allowed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Since its foundation, the Competition Authority has taken on an active role in the economy. Having received additional powers under the Competition Act 2002, the authority is ready to assume a more active and effective role in the economy. Old cases are being cleared out to allow the authority concentrate on priority issues and it has increased its staffing level considerably during the past six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">As stated earlier, the authority's annual report was recently published as well as a major report on a number of professions. I congratulate the authority, particularly the chairman, Dr. John Fingleton, on these excellent studies. In addition, reports on the banking sector and the insurance industry are currently in preparation.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Representatives of the authority came before the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, which is carrying out studies into the insurance industry. I am aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has taken up this matter as a priority of her ministry. Insurance costs are becoming a major issue in the economy in terms of public liability, car insurance and other insurance companies which operate in the marketplace. There is no competition in this area. Many businesses have been forced to cease trading as a result of the increase in insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Following advertisements, the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business received an enormous number of submissions on this area and the number of industries and small companies that have closed is frightening. Insurance costs for small companies have trebled. I am aware that the Tánaiste intends to ensure that a change is brought about in the industry and I wish her well in her endeavours.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Promoting competition has been a relatively underdeveloped area of economic policy but it is now one of the main policy tools available to ensure a productive economy. That puts a heavy onus on the authority, which has much ground to cover, but also on the Government, which has the final responsibility for policy action and ensuring the authority has the firepower to successfully undertake this vital role.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I take this opportunity to congratulate all the staff of the Competition Authority, particularly Dr. John Fingleton, on their tremendous work. It is important that the momentum is maintained because it will boost competition and significantly contribute to the economic well-being of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">An area about which I have been concerned over the past 12 months, and on which I contacted the Competition Authority, is the beef industry. There is a view abroad that a cartel is working in that industry. Farmers are dissatisfied with the consistently low prices being paid for their quality of product and the same prices are being paid across the entire industry and in all the factories. It is obvious that there is some type of arrangement in the industry to maintain prices at a certain level.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The difference in the price of petrol and diesel throughout the country is interesting. Anyone driving from Roscommon to Dublin or the south will find there are enormous differences in prices. One can pay between 89.1 cent and 94.9 cent per litre of unleaded petrol in some locations. That is a considerable difference but members of the public are literally voting with their feet. The Leas-Chathaoirleach will be aware of the major difference in petrol and diesel prices between Belmullet and Dublin. Competition has ensured that they are maintained at the lowest possible prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The same applies to the airline industry. In fairness to Ryanair and other low cost airlines, they have reduced costs and created competition. I am sure the Tánaiste is delighted with the way Aer Lingus, which is now extremely competitive, has responded. We wish to see the same environment created in the insurance industry in particular. That would be a tremendous personal achievement for the Tánaiste, in conjunction with the Competition Authority. The Tánaiste put in place a number of measures in this regard since returning to office as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last year. I hope she can bring about a result that will reduce the cost of insurance, which will in turn stimulate job creation. It is discouraging for anyone setting up in business to be presented with enormous insurance costs and it is a deterrent to the creation of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Anyone who saw the "Prime Time" programme on fraud in the insurance industry will understand the reasons costs are so high in the economy. One individual from Tralee made approximately seven claims in recent years, while another young boy was encouraged to make claims. This has resulted in enormous insurance costs. The banning of advertisements by solicitors encouraging people to make claims on a "No foal, no fee" basis is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">I welcome the Tánaiste to the House. The work of the Competition Authority is very worthwhile. This House endorses the work of the authority and wishes it well in the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_562">I welcome the Tánaiste. We are aware of her keen interest in this area, particularly in regard to insurance. I look forward to the ongoing work of the Competition Authority as outlined by Senator Leyden.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I welcome the motion and the opportunity to speak on the various matters highlighted in the Competition Authority's report. Of its nature, it is something of a preliminary report which is highly critical of the medical and legal professions. As we are aware, the authority is investigating eight professions in all.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">It was rather startling to read that the cost of legal and medical services could be reduced by up to 30% if anti-competitive practices in these professions were ended. At least that is the view of Indecon, the economic consultants commissioned by the Competition Authority to prepare this report.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">This major report will form part of a three year process of assessing anti-competitive practices in eight professions. The process is due to end next year by which time the authority hopes to have issued further reports and recommendations on each of the professions concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Mr. Alan Gray, managing director of Indecon, pointed out that in other jurisdictions the removal of anti-competitive practices such as demarcation had led to falls in prices of 10% to 20%. However, when a number of anti-competitive practices were removed regarding a single profession, decreases in prices of 20% to 30% resulted. He cited solicitors, barristers and doctors as professions where such large decreases in costs were possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The other professions included in the Competition Authority's ongoing inquiry are architects, engineers, vets, opticians and dentists. So far the studies have found that there is normal competition between architects and engineers. However, with the other professions the extent of the restrictions on competition is very significant. The extent of the restrictions in the legal and medical professions is, according to Mr. Gray, "really very remarkable and has the effect of damaging consumer interests." He said the issues identified in the report were ones which Indecon believed should be addressed as a priority by the Competition Authority and Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The Competition Authority's chairman, Dr. John Fingleton, has indicated that it will use the report as a detailed base for the remainder of its study of competition in the professions concerned. The study will now progress profession by profession, starting with engineers and working concurrently rather than sequentially, and consultation papers will be published before a final report on each profession. Dr. Fingleton made the point that in beginning with the engineering profession it was likely to be completed quickly because it was not heavily regulated and he believed this would be of interest when hearing arguments from other professions with regard to regulation and quality of service.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Control of education and limits on advertising seem to be the most common barriers to competition. Mr. Gray of Indecon found very severe restrictions on competition between solicitors, extensive restrictions on competition between barristers, a number of extensive restrictions affecting competition between doctors and significant restrictions on competition between vets and dentists. As already stated, it found relatively few restrictions to competition between architects and engineers. Regarding opticians, he said there were a number of restrictions which had a potentially negative effect on competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The prohibition in some professions on members setting up limited companies and working in multidisciplinary practices with other professions and issues to do with demarcation and conduct led to restrictions on competition. The report stated that removing the restrictions on some professionals forming limited companies could increase investment in the provision of services such as primary health care. Dr. Fingleton said the effects of any changes introduced could take time to work their way into the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The report found that the Law Society's monopoly on the provision of certain courses for trainee solicitors was likely to restrict the number of entrants to the profession and also meant that Dublin was the only location where such training was available. Removing certain restrictions on solicitors who qualified in other jurisdictions coming to practise in Ireland would enhance competition. It also stated solicitors should be allowed to advertise superior specialist services and make "cold call" approaches to potential clients. Personal injury services would be an exception – we have all seen the extensive advertising in the <i>Golden Pages</i> by solicitors, an indication of how lucrative the business is. I agree with the report's conclusions about the exclusion of such services.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">On conveyancing, the report stated restrictions on solicitors from other EU jurisdictions offering such services should be lifted and that a system of licensed conveyancers could be introduced. It also stated solicitors should be allowed to form limited liability companies and work with members of other professions.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">The report stated the Kings Inns monopoly on the provision of a number of legal courses was likely to restrict the number of entrants to the profession of barrister. It also stated the fact that trainees were not paid was likely to act as a barrier to the profession. Rules that prevented barristers from advertising and prohibited clients getting direct access to barristers were likely to restrict competition. It criticised the restrictions whereby barristers employed by companies were not allowed address the courts and, furthermore, were obliged to use a solicitor to get access to a practising barrister who would then represent the company in court. Again, it found that barristers should be allowed to form companies and work in multidisciplinary practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The report stated many of the regulations covering the medical profession were appropriate and for the protection of the public. It added, however, that there were extensive restrictions that inhibited competition and investment without providing proportionate benefits. The limitation on places in medical schools cuts competition, as does the system used to control the transfer here of doctors from non-EU countries. It pointed out that the system for creating and filling public sector consultancy posts was too slow and not responsive enough to demand. We all know about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">According to the report, no limit should be placed on the number of medical card contracts that could be awarded to general practitioners in any particular area. This would facilitate the creation of new GP practices and allow the number of practices to respond to market demands. There should be scope for patients to make direct contact with consultants without having to go to a GP first.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The report concluded that a system for registering qualified dental technicians and denturists would increase competition in the sector by allowing people other than dentists to sell dentures to customers. Rules in relation to non-EU dentists coming here to practise were criticised, as well as the limitation on the number of places.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">We are all at one on this issue. I am aware of the Tánaiste's keen interest in the area, which is very welcome, but there are contradictions that we must address. The recent Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill provided for the transfer of large sums from one insurance company to another. Choice is needed. We must become more consistent in our practices. I support the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_183">
          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_578">I am glad to have the opportunity to address the Seanad on this important issue as I firmly believe implementing a successful programme of regulatory reform is critical to our ability as a country to sustain future economic and social progress. I am a firm believer in the power of competition to benefit the consumer and spur innovation and productivity growth. Research has shown that vigorous competition in local markets not only benefits consumers but is also an essential element in providing the competitive base that will enable export companies to succeed in world markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">While we have been very successful at attracting and developing an export sector which has productivity levels and growth rates up there with the best in the world, the same cannot be said for some of our sheltered sectors. The difference is not the brains or talent of those involved but their exposure to competition. Given our small home market, our internationally traded sector has to compete with the best in Europe and the world, while our sheltered sector is frequently protected from real competition by way of archaic regulations or cosy cartels. That is the reason there is such a strong focus on competition and regulatory reform in both the programme for Government and the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">I have a particular concern for consumers, not least because of the fact that although everyone is a consumer at some level, consumers do not have a very loud representative voice. I have put the consumer at the top of the priority agenda, as stated in An Agreed Programme for Government, and I am determined that we remove unwarranted constraints on competition in the interests principally of consumer welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Regulatory reform is one strand of this campaign. It is the process of reviewing both the quality and quantity of regulation to ensure it promotes economic and social well-being. The Government's better regulation agenda involves measures to improve existing and new regulations. We need to examine critically the need for regulation and the effects it can have on our citizens. Although regulation is an important tool for governments to achieve public policy goals, too much regulation can impede growth, stifle creativity and create bottlenecks in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">We have a wide range of regulation in Ireland. The electricity, gas and telecommunications systems are regulated. Airport charges and access to the airwaves are regulated, as are the professions and public transport. Equally, we have a range of standards in regulation. I support well thought out and properly implemented regulation in areas where competition alone will not achieve optimum consumer welfare. However, these must be horizontal, transparent rules which apply equally to existing and new market entrants and not simply a mechanism to confer advantages on incumbent suppliers.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">What is the state of our regulation and who can give an authoritative independent view on it? The OECD in its report on regulatory reform in Ireland, published in 2001, said that we made a good start in implementing a regulatory reform programme, that we compare well with other OECD countries in terms of market access and that the pace of liberalisation of the telecommunications and aviation sectors has resulted in many benefits. However, it pointed out that there is much more to be done in respect of certain sectors to strengthen competition and rebalance the relationship between producer and consumer in favour of the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Prior to the OECD report, we had made much progress on competition law. There was a wide-ranging review by an expert group which resulted in the drafting of the Bill which became the Competition Act 2002. The Act brought together competition and merger control law and implemented significant changes. These included the abolition of the notification system for agreements and more independence for the Competition Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">In the important area of enforcement, enhanced powers were given to the Competition Authority. There are increased jail terms from two years to five years for so-called "hard core" competition offences, such as price-fixing and market-sharing. Powers of arrest and detention were also introduced. Responsibility for deciding upon mergers, other than media mergers, was transferred from my Department to the Competition Authority on 1 January last, with decisions on non-media mergers being based solely on competition criteria. The Act also gives the Authority a clear advocacy role regarding measures necessary to improve competition in markets by way of structural and regulatory changes. To complement improvements in the law, the resources, both staff and financial, of the Competition Authority have been significantly improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The Government is committed to better regulation and much has been achieved in areas such as taxis, liquor licensing and pharmacies. However, we recognise that much remains to be done and that if state regulation is excessive in quantity or of poor quality, it will be an unnecessary burden on economic and social activity. Our approach to regulatory reform is pragmatic. We want to simplify regulation and ensure that it is proportionate.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Following receipt of the OECD report, the Government put in train a number of actions to address issues raised. The retail pharmacy sector was criticised by the OECD in regard of the award of general medical service contracts to pharmacies on what was regarded as a restrictive basis. Restrictions included quantitative entry criteria and the offending regulations which governed this matter have been revoked. Entry to the retail pharmacy profession now has no restrictions on granting contracts in terms of location, population or viability of existing pharmacies. The opening of new pharmacies continues to be governed by the Pharmacy Acts, which apply qualitative criteria and are subject to restrictions imposed by non-pharmacy legislation such as planning law.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">The OECD recommended the restriction on pharmacists educated in other EU countries managing or supervising a pharmacy that is less than three years old be eliminated. I agree with OECD on this, but Ireland has availed of a derogation under the relevant European directive on the free movement of pharmacists which permits the restriction. A review group appointed by the Minister for Health and Children in October 2001 has completed its work in regard to retail pharmacy and the Minister is currently examining the report. I look forward to seeing remaining quantitative restrictions lifted.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">In the area of pub licensing, much progress was made in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000. Furthermore, the Commission on Liquor Licensing published a report in 2001 recommending a further easing of restriction in the off-licence trade. In 2002, it published studies with recommendations focusing, in particular, on theatres and night clubs and on access to licensed premises. The commission published a further report today. I look forward, on the basis of its work. to seeing a more competitive bar trade emerging in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">In so far as my responsibilities are concerned, the Competition Authority's study of the professions started in May 2001, following the OECD report which suggested that competition in the professional services sector in Ireland could be stronger. Following a preliminary public consultation process, the authority announced that the study would cover competition in eight professions in three sectors: engineers and architects in the construction sector; medical practitioners, veterinary surgeons, dentists and optometrists in the medical sector; and solicitors and barristers in the legal sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">These professions touch on almost every aspect of society and they work in critical areas of people's lives, such as health, food safety, legal rights and security of building structures. Historically, the way the professions were regulated had important and often unintended consequences. If regulations or restrictions result in unnecessarily high prices, barriers to the provision of professional services, disincentives to innovate or barriers to entry to these professions, the negative consequences for consumers can be significant. A situation of inappropriate or bad regulation leads to higher costs, which, in turn, contribute to inflation. In the current climate we need to avail of every opportunity to keep down inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Many aspects of regulation have no adverse impact on competition. Examples would be professional competence, client confidentiality and codes of ethics. In other cases, however, regulation may sometimes damage competition, notably in the restriction of educational facilities for aspirants, quotas on numbers of operators, quotas on students and "scale" or "recommended" fees. Some restrictions may, however, be justified if there are wider public policy benefits. It is essential to ensure that regulation does not simply protect certain practitioners or serve to support narrow, vested economic interests. It is important to also recognise that, for the most part, maintaining standards and facilitating competition are mutually supportive.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The Competition Authority has received a wide-ranging report on the professions from its consultants and is now taking the result of that work into account in finalising its study. At this stage I will not comment in detail on the work which has to be done, other than to say that it is disturbing to see the list of restrictions which exist across the range of professions. It is important that vested interests are not permitted to maintain the <i>status quo</i> because in many cases this militates directly against our fight to be competitive and provide consumers, whether they purchase services or goods, with the best deal possible at every level.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Senators are aware that the Competition Authority is also involved in studies of the insurance and banking areas, the former in conjunction with my Department. This is a study of competition issues in the non-life insurance market, with particular reference to motor insurance, employer's liability and public liability. It arises from the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. It is intended that most of the work on this study will be completed in 2003. The study of competition in the provision of banking services – excluding investment banking – will identity barriers to entry into non-investment banking in the State. It will also identify and analyse industry practices, legislation and/or administrative practices in non-investment banking in the State that limit the degree of rivalry on the market to the detriment of consumers. It is intended that this study will also be completed in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The new social partnership agreement contains a number of objectives and commitments on regulatory reform and seeks to renew Ireland's competitiveness using a broad range of policies. It advocates a regulatory policy that provides for the screening of new and existing regulations in terms of their impact on the economy and society, establishes the framework whereby regulatory arrangements can be optimised for particular market sectors and renews the focus on reducing the burden being imposed, through regulation, on the citizen and business.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Sustaining Progress also contains a commitment to publish a White Paper this year and to introduce regulatory impact assessment in all Government Departments. There will be a renewed emphasis on sectoral regulatory reforms, including reforms in the networked industries and infrastructural sectors, and, in particular, markets such as liquor licensing, financial services, construction, legal and health care professions. In addition, there will be a renewed emphasis on creating a better regulatory environment for enterprise, particularly for companies of small and medium size.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">In the area of anti-inflation initiatives, to help exert downward pressure on inflation in order that we can maintain competitiveness in some areas and recover it in others, Sustaining Progress contains a commitment to set up a group representative of the major economic departments, IBEC and the ICTU. It also includes participation, as appropriate, from the Competition Authority and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. It is envisaged that this group will draw up an action plan on anti-inflation initiatives and monitor progress on this plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">At this stage of our country's development, I find it difficult to understand why restrictions, which were justified historically by arguments such as "maintaining employment", remain when all evidence has shown that where there is real competition, there are benefits for businesses, professions and consumers. The truth is that vigorous competition benefits the economy and society through lower costs, low inflation and higher employment.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_599">I am glad to have the opportunity of responding to this debate. First, I welcome the Tánaiste and congratulate her on the work she has been doing for the consumer in this area. It has been progressive and positive in many ways and I have been very happy to co-operate and support it in as many ways as I possibly can. The initiatives that have been taken are having an effect, albeit far too slowly but the work cannot be done more quickly because there are real difficulties to overcome. It is trying to unlock and uncover issues that have existed for generations, in some cases for centuries. I take heart from the reference in broad general terms in the Tánaiste's speech to the question of regulation. She said, "I support well thought out and properly implemented regulation in areas where competition alone will not achieve optimum consumer welfare." I support this nuanced approach to regulation. That is what it is necessary and where things need to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Elsewhere the Tánaiste referred to the resources and supports for the Competition Authority. Recently I indicated in this House that at the first opportunity I would put a proposal to the Tánaiste and will take the opportunity of doing so now. The Criminal Asset Bureau's success has created some additional resources for the State, perhaps not huge amounts but in the meantime the Competition Authority is now dealing with issues that can lead to criminal charges. It is investigating potential criminal offences, yet its resources – the last time I checked – amounted to no more than three detectives for the whole State.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I ask the Tánaiste to consider as an appropriate move redirecting some of the resources from the CAB to the Competition Authority. This would produce a double gain. In the CAB we are recovering resources that have been stolen from the State in one form or another and which we can now effectively invest in continuing the work under the Competition Authority. It would be an appropriate, positive and progressive <i>quid pro quo</i> to move resources from one area to the other. I ask the Tánaiste to consider whether that is a feasible proposal and whether on its own terms it is feasible for the Competition Authority to attempt to do the work she has set out for it. Nobody in the House will disapprove of or argue against the outline of work that has been laid down but there is a huge amount to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">Leaving aside the issues dealt with in the Tánaiste's speech and also by Senator Coghlan, with all of which I agree, particularly regarding the Indecon report, there remains the issue of price fixing. In the past week I have travelled around the country a lot and now automatically check fuel prices as I drive through every town. I could make a list of the towns where clearly there are price fixing cartels.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_604">I passed through a town today where I counted seven large service fuel stations and not one of them offered a price that was 0.1 cent different from any of the others. I passed through the next town, ten miles away, to find there was a broad difference of ten cent between the cheapest and the dearest. It is very easy to see that seven outlets do not suddenly come on the same figure of 89.9 cent or 90.6 cent, or whatever the figure happens to be, per litre, suggesting that there is some form of conspiracy, co-ordination, or cartel operating in those situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Another issue I have raised several times in the past couple of months is the gap between the price paid to farmers at the farm gate and that paid by consumers at the other end. This includes the price of milk, meat and other products. There is an operation that we need to look at very closely. On a number of occasions we have discussed the question of building, housing and land development in that context, something that we need to and can do. I ask that those issues be looked at very closely.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Personal injuries is another example of an area where prices and costs can be reduced. In personal injury cases somewhere between 25% and 50% of the cost on average comprises legal fees; in other words, it never reaches the victim. This percentage very often rises to 70% or 75% but on average is somewhere between 25% and 50%, which is unacceptable and cannot continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">Controlling inflation is a concern which everyone shares. It is not just a matter for Government, the business community or workers. It affects everybody, including consumers, families, and the broader community.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The issues outlined in the motion are important for every one of us. We must at least put our shoulders behind them to give them as much support as possible. The partnership programme will be of help in this direction but on its own will not deliver the goods. Opening up the areas which have come through in the Indecon report is crucial. Further resources for the Competition Authority are also crucial as it cannot do its work without them. I would like to see at least ten more trained or qualified detectives available to it in order that it can conduct the investigations that are necessary and will be required if it is to deliver the goods. It gives me great pleasure to support the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_609">I welcome the Minister of State for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern. I am sorry that the Tánaiste has had to leave but that is no reflection on the Minister of State. Perhaps I am relieved that she had to leave in that she addressed in much of her speech the pharmacy sector which I intend to cover.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_189">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_611">I belong to a party which supports competition and the market economy. However, that is not to say the market economy does not have its limitations or that there are not instances where Government must intervene to protect the public interest. I am not driven to achieve a free market at any cost. I recognise, for example, the need for Government to intervene, particularly in the provision of key social and health services. When it comes to services of this nature, the overriding consideration must be what Government can do to ensure quality services are available or to improve services, whether they are provided directly by Government or on behalf of Government through the private sector. Appropriate services should be delivered by the private sector on behalf of Government where it is effective and efficient to do so. For example, I recently read a report from the pharmaeconomics department of St. James's Hospital that estimated that it was 11 times cheaper for Government to deliver the methadone protocol through the private sector, that is, through pharmacies and general practitioners, than directly through State services.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I am happy to say I support the motion. In doing so I put down a clear marker that competition and economics are not the be all and end all in providing professional services for the people. The Tánaiste referred at some length to the debate on pharmacy, one of the areas of which I have some experience and on which I would like to make a few points to highlight the arguments I am making. The decision is whether we view a pharmacy as a retailer driven by economics or as an integral part of the health service operated by professionals who provide a medical service for their customers. It is interesting to note that even when all sectors of the medical service are under attack, there is no dissatisfaction among members of the public with the service provided for them by their local community pharmacist, yet we have a situation where people driven by economic logic are set on following a course of action that will seriously damage the service available to the customer. A recent report commissioned by the EU on the economic impact of regulation in the field of liberal professions in different member states interestingly showed that Ireland has the lowest level of regulation in the pharmacy sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">In a submission to the Pharmacy Review Group referred to by the Tánaiste, the Asthma Society of Ireland stated that it, "as a representative organisation of and for people with asthma, would have grave concerns with regard to this term of reference that deems to ‘maximise the potential to increase competition within the sector', if this means deregulating the sector." It stated that encouraging open competition, whereby chains of pharmacies could set up throughout Ireland, would more than likely damage local pharmacies in the community. It also stated that:</p>
          <p eId="para_614">There is also the risk that opening up competition within the pharmacy sector will actually lead to the closure of rural pharmacies, with new pharmacies being established in the more economically viable areas. This would mark the decline of these essential community amenities; the very opposite of what your fifth term of reference implies. Simply put, the Irish pharmacy is not merely a business venture; it is an integral part of our primary care system. The pharmacist is also the first port of call for many who don't have a medical card and are looking for medical advice. The customer gets free advice and reassurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">In its submission, the Diabetes Federation stated the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_616">We feel that the de-regulation of pharmacy services may curtail services and in effect reduce patient care, as has been the case in the United States, just at a time when the role of the pharmacist in the promotion of primary, secondary and tertiary care has been identified as an important element in the provision of future diabetes patient care in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The Irish Senior Citizens Parliament stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Our experience shows us that pharmacy services, if they are to be effective, must be available as locally as possible to people, and staffed by confident pharmacists who build up a personal relationship with their customers. This, we believe, is something that you cannot put a price on.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The national health strategy, 2001, was based on core principles of equity, being people-centred, quality, accountability, continuity of care, a holistic approach and improved population health. The current ownership structure of the community pharmacy sector in Ireland facilitates the delivery of such a service and should be allowed to continue to do so. The challenge for the future, therefore, should be to build on that core base of professional service managed and controlled by pharmacists.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that the cost-effectiveness of the Pharmacy Regulations 1996 saved the Exchequer at least €155 million annually as a result of significant reductions in the leakage of demand in other parts of the health service. For example, increased drug compliance resulted in reduction of demand for accident and emergency services.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">In rural areas we have seen this type of thing before. Gone are the local bank, post office and corner shop – valuable community services lost forever in the name of ideology. The community pharmacy may be next and we cannot afford to let this happen. PWC also showed that there is considerable evidence to suggest that in excess of 300 of the 1,200 pharmacies in this country are very small marginal businesses, which are now vulnerable to closure if we proceed with a deregulated market.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">At a recent seminar on the future of pharmacy in Ireland, the American experience was discussed and the dangers associated with a free market in the delivery of pharmacy services. Their experience is that rural health care suffered in a deregulated market because multinationals concentrated mostly in large population centres – the US chains concentrated on the east and west coasts. This will hit hardest the highest users of pharmacy services – the elderly, the long-term ill, etc. – who will have to travel further for access to these services. In Norway, the Government deregulated pharmacy services 18 months ago and today three chains own 70% of all pharmacies. There is no reason to believe the Irish experience will be any different.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The recently published report by the UK Office of Fair Trading called for the full deregulation of the pharmacy sector in the UK. The report was quickly rebuffed by the UK Trade and Industry Secretary, who said, "I am clear that there are limits to markets, particularly in the delivery of health services." Her comments were quickly followed by those of Lord Borrie QC, former director general of the OFT and Labour Peer, who said:</p>
          <p eId="para_624">I do not think we should take risks with the health of the nation. The key public benefit of the current regulations in pharmacy is the ease of access .. Deregulation would be a jump in the dark. The risk of less easy access is too great to justify what the OFT is suggesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">On superpubs, I note that the recently published report on the drinks trade recommends that limitations be placed on the size and location of pubs. The report recommends that the owner should manage pubs and that new publicans cannot own more than one premises, specifically to reduce the power of the chains. The report, backed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, calls for the replacement of superpubs by small owner-run premises which will be designed to serve the needs of local communities. Why are pubs' licences being treated in this way while pharmacy licences are being thrown to the wolves?</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Have the economists taken a narrow view in certain areas and, as a result, confused our priorities to act in the overall good? Following free market ideology is not enough, we have to consider all aspects of the service required and ensure we legislate in the public interest. As legislators, we have a responsibility to question varying opinions – those of the economist, the vested interest groups and the consumer – and, in particular, we need to way up the consequences of our proposed decisions. Having examined the proposed courses of action, we should legislate in the overall interests of the community we serve.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_190">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_627">What is great about being a pragmatist is that one picks up the best ideas and looks at the concepts that work. That is one of the reasons I long ago abandoned liberal market economics. They do not work because they are based on presumptions about human behaviour that are not true. They espouse the view that people should be driven into a form of behaviour which is inimical to their well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">When one looks at something like competition, one starts from the same base, namely, what works best for those who are receiving the service, and this is where economists have a problem. What is best cannot be encompassed by considerations of price alone. It is probably indisputable that Ryanair provides, in many cases, the cheapest air service between this country and the United Kingdom, but it is highly debatable that it provides the best.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">This evening I read the executive summary of the Competition Authority's report on the professions. I endeavoured to print it but, in the joys of monopoly service providers, my printer would not work and apparently it will take another week to get it fixed. I could not print it, but I did read it. I was intrigued by the different parts of it. I am particularly intrigued by the fact that the authority identified the problem of the quantitative restriction in entry to a number of the professions – particularly medicine, dentistry and veterinary science. There is a degree to which this is also true in the case of the architectural profession. There is no simple solution to that particular problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">I have believed all my life that every young person in this country should be able to enter any profession for which he or she has the intellectual capacity. There should be no quantitative restrictions on the entry to any profession. That is the single best and simplest way of dealing with some of the restrictive practices which appear to characterise some of our more eminent professions. That is the first aspect. Are we going to take the responsibility, which will be expensive for the State, of ensuring that there are enough places for every young person in the country who wants to study medicine, veterinary science, dentistry or law? There are enough places for anybody who wants to do engineering, my own profession. There are probably not enough for those who want to do architecture.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_192">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_632">It is a very competitive profession and always has been. In fact, I am a little taken aback at the Indecon suggestion that the consumer would be better off if the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland did not publish records of fees. The consumer would be worse off if he or she did not know. The lists should be an accurate record of historical data: this is what the ACEI and the IEI do. The idea that these could be a constraint on competition is another matter which could be debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">We have surrounded what we call the liberal professions in a cloud of mumbo-jumbo and self-righteous self-importance. The sooner much of this is cut away the better but some of the nonsense the Competition Authority has come out with about health care needs and deserves to be challenged. It is of the opinion, in public, that if there was more competition in the provision of health care, the consumer would be better off and prices would drop. The problem is that there is an infinite demand for health care. As there is no limit to the demand, the more that is provided the more people will want. If we have competitive provision based on market principles, we end up with a more expensive health service – as has happened in the USA where the health service is the most expensive in the world, costing 14% of the GDP. The USA is the richest country in the world: according to the way economists present these figures, it is perhaps 25% richer than most countries in Europe, yet it costs Americans that much more to have a health service which has singularly failed to give them a life expectancy as high as that of many countries in Europe and has tragically failed to give them an infant mortality rate comparable with that of the best countries in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Let us not get carried away with competition. The solution, in terms of the so-called liberal professions, is very straightforward. It is to allow, or require, people to publish fees, increase the supply of qualified personnel, reduce the artificial qualification barriers that are often introduced and establish objective criteria. The students I teach do four years of study and within six months of leaving the course can go out and be left in charge of a piece of equipment costing perhaps €5 million or €10 million. After six months they are regarded by tough, competitive, market focused US multinationals as capable of being left in charge of something like that, perhaps overnight.</p>

          <p eId="para_637">The legal profession, on the other hand, would have us believe somebody who does a four year degree in law needs another four years before he or she can function adequately as a lawyer. That is palpable nonsense. Either there is something wrong with the degree course or there is something wrong with the subsequent training.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">There is one thing in the Indecon report which is dangerous nonsense and demonstrates how we should not let ideology get in the way of practicality. The idea that every specialist consultant should be directly accessible to every individual who has a pain, without referral from a general practitioner, is a recipe for chaos. We may well investigate whether there are enough consultants – that is a separate issue – but the idea that we would improve the quality of health care by allowing everybody who had a pain in his or her head and thought he or she had a brain tumour to go straight to a specialist rather than having to accept the practical and common-sense advice of a GP first is absolute nonsense. Only those who had let ideology cloud practicality would come up with such a recommendation.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_642">I welcome the Minister of State. I will talk about the last part of the motion:</p>
          <p eId="para_643">[that Seanad Éireann] supports the Competition Authority and the Director of Consumer Affairs being given additional priorities and tasks to boost this counter-inflationary policy, including:</p>
          <p eId="para_644">(i) more aggressive implementation of competition policy, including dealing with sheltered sectors where unnecessary barriers to entry exist,</p>
          <p eId="para_645">and</p>
          <p eId="para_646">(ii) accelerating the studies of professional services, which were initiated by the Competition Authority at the request of the Government on foot of the OECD review of Ireland's regulatory regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I will try to stick to my last remark and discuss the medical profession. It is very odd to hear the word "competition" used so much in dealing with the medical profession because most of us involved in it feel that if only we could have a bit more competition, life might be a bit more bearable. Far too many doctors are far too busy and many, unfortunately, are now taking early retirement. I do not think this has been taken into account, nor has it been taken into account by those who would address the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Thirty per cent of all doctors are general practitioners and work, on average, a 79 hour week, of which 46 hours is on calls. I note that this all comes from the report we are discussing. A total of 39% of general practitioners said it was extremely difficult to get help. Another 33% said it was very difficult. In other words, 52% were having terrible trouble in getting help to run their practices. We must take into account that there really is a shortage of supply rather than a need for competition. This has not been dealt with in the report. Certainly, the price of a visit to a general practitioner seems to be about €35 but is more expensive in town than in the country. The increase in the price of a consultation with a general practitioner is larger than inflation but one thing on which the Minister for Health and Children and I agree all the time is that medical inflation has been much larger than general inflation, of which, unfortunately, our old bugbear, insurance, is a very important part.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Deputy Glennon could be asked about the increases Medisec have had to bring forward. He initiated a very economic scheme but after a certain number of years the fees are now about twice what they used to be. That is a big problem. On questioning patients, the authors of the report did not find that price was a major factor in whom one chose as a doctor. Geographical proximity, reputation, quality of service and customer trust, as it was described – I would prefer to have seen it being described as patient trust, but what harm – were more important factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I have found that one of the greatest difficulties experienced by general practitioners in starting up lies in getting planning permission. Senators might remember that in the good old days people could start in their front rooms or perhaps have a garage converted but that is no longer allowed. Obtaining planning permission in one of the new shopping centres is a difficulty but there is also the problem of cost. These outlets, which are competing with retail outlets, are very expensive. This is certainly putting up the cost of seeing general practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Quite rightly, patients would like more information on fees. Perhaps the Medical Council's stipulations have been too harsh – certainly, one cannot advertise one's fees in the <i>Yellow Pages</i>– but one can put up a schedule of charges in one's surgery. The vast majority of doctors do this. It is nearly a form of advertising because it does tell people about one's specialist services. I do not think doctors would have a problem with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The report did discuss the issue of doctors' being disallowed from forming limited liability companies with other medical or paramedical practitioners. It seems a good idea from the point of view of economics. We all see how well the new co-operatives are working. However, there is one problem. The report stated if doctors set up a limited liability company, there could be specialists within the company but there is a problem with this. If the company had a specialist in toenails, we could see everybody being referred for treatment for their toenails for the good of the company – not that any of my colleagues would ever think of doing something like this. That is something we have to take into account just in case in the distant future some medical practitioners are like that. It could end up making things more rather than less expensive for the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Over the years there have been clinics that have occasionally developed very bad reputations for continually referring patients from one person to another. That adds hugely to the cost of health care services and was at one stage tackled by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">It is a pity general practitioners are so dependent on the pharmaceutical companies for promotional literature encouraging people to have vaccinations, even though the Department of Health and Children produces some very good literature. Patients who have colostomies have a stoma with a bag attached and they have to learn how to deal with it. A patient recently pointed out to me that all the stoma care nurses are employed by the pharmaceutical companies. Naturally they will push their own product and encourage frequent use and frequent changing. It would be far better if the Department of Health and Children employed stoma care nurses. In areas like this more competition would be extremely useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The report says there should be easier entry for all general practitioners into the General Medical Service. I could not but support this. Nowadays the IMO must be consulted to see if setting up another GMS list in an area where there are plenty of other doctors with GMS lists would be resisted by people in those areas. This very rarely happens now and the most serious problem is getting people to take up GMS lists in some parts of the country. It is not a question of trying to get competition for these lists; it is a question of getting anyone to take them at all. Not all of this was taken into account by the people who wrote the review.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Some 25% of doctors in the country are consultants, but we have a terrible shortage of consultants. The report points out that we are ranked 13th out of 14 European countries in the number of inhabitants per doctor. The health boards and hospitals apply for the doctors they want and are far more likely to apply for cardiac surgeons than neurologists. There is a desperate shortage of neurologists, but people with Parkinsonism or degenerative myelomas do not get the same sort of attention that people with bad hearts do.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">There is a serious delay in appointing consultants. This is not just the fault of Comhairle na nOspidéal or the Department. A doctor who is appointed in December might not agree to start until September due to existing commitments. These sorts of considerations have not been taken into account. They have taken no notice of these important delays.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">We must be careful about assessing the non-EU medical schools through which people from outside the European Union have qualified. Not enough consideration is given to that. The Medical Practitioners Act, which we brought in with great haste last June to allow service as well as examinations to be taken into account, still has not been enforced. We have been promised for years a medical practitioners Act but still do not have one.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">There are plenty of people who are skilled enough to come forward for medical posts. However, they have to be given intern jobs in order to be registered. The Department will not allow for an increase in the number of intern jobs when there are already too many.</p>
