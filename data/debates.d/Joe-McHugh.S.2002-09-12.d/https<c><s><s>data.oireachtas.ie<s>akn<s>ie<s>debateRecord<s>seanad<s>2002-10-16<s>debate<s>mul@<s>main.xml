          <from>An Cathaoirleach:</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I have notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make an urgent statement concerning the decision by Cardinal Healthcare to defer its investment in Longford for at least two years as a positive statement is needed to lift commercial life in Longford and give a much needed economic boost to the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Scanlon of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to investigate the circumstances surrounding the disposal of TB cattle belonging to farmers from County Sligo to a meat plant in the Dublin area which has subsequently gone out of business; and what steps he will take to ensure that the farmers concerned are compensated for their loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Leyden of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address the current crisis in the beef industry and to direct the Competition Authority to carry out a re-investigation into the alleged anti-competitive pricing structure within the beef processing industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Terry of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to make a statement concerning the failure in his Department to properly fund Morton Stadium, Santry, and the reason his Department has reneged on a payment of €79,000 per year to the stadium since 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Bannon, Scanlon and Leyden and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Terry may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</p>

        <heading>Order of Business.</heading>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Ms O'Rourke:</from>
          <p eId="para_10">The Order of Business is No. 1, European Union (Scrutiny) Bill, 2002 – all Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 20 minutes, to be resumed after Private Members' Business, if not previously concluded; No. 2, motion re restoration to the Order Paper of the Immigration Bill, 2002, to be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re restoration to the Order Paper of the Official Languages (Equality) Bill, 2002, to be taken without debate; and No. 19, motion No. 9. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is in attendance and anxious to take the European Union (Scrutiny) Bill. In view of this, I propose that consideration of Nos. 4 to 16, inclusive, on the Order Paper, dealing with the establishment of committees of the Houses, be deferred until tomorrow.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes:</from>
          <p eId="para_11">I have no difficulty with the Leader's proposal for dealing with Nos. 4 to 16, inclusive, on the Order Paper. Will she contact her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in connection with the growing problem of stabbings, especially in large towns and cities? She is no doubt aware that to date this year, of the 53 murders committed in the country, 25 were the result of violent and vicious stabbings. In view of the unfortunate events of the past weekend and the seeming rise of the knife sub-culture in some parts of the country, will she discuss this issue with the Minister to see if additional legislation is required to amend the Dangerous Weapons Act, 1990, to restrict further or prohibit the proliferation of these dangerous weapons?</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The proposed Order of Business for tomorrow has only one item. We, on this side of the House, need to debate various issues. In view of this, it is inappropriate that only one item of legislation be debated on a sitting day. Unless there is a problem of a work to rule on the other side of the House, there is a need to include a number of items on the Order of Business for each sitting day to ensure relevant issues, such as the Flood tribunal interim report or Northern Ireland, raised last week in the House, can be debated when they first arise.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole:</from>
          <p eId="para_13">I congratulate the Government side of the House on accepting and dealing with a Labour Party Bill today. It is a sign of a new approach. We hope the Government will be open to consideration of more Bills from this side of the House, especially from the Independent benches. Perhaps we will begin the process on Private Members' Business today.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I agree with Senator Hayes's comments on debating issues. Last year there was a major controversy over the housing issue. The decisions taken then have not worked. It is appalling that after all the argument about affordable housing, only 272 houses in that category were built last year. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is being snowballed with requests from the building industry. If there is any sign of the Government caving in to its demands, there will be war. It is unacceptable. The House should clearly indicate it will not stand aside and see that happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The issue of Northern Ireland is even more crucial than housing and it is important that we express our views. There is an extraordinary gap which needs to be looked at. We must look at what can be done from this perspective. The answer has never been the Assembly alone but, as the people of this island saw it, the Good Friday Agreement to which we must restate our commitment. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, is coming to the House later. I ask the Leader to put it to him that we should now consider the re-establishment of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation which did not finish its business and did not deal with issues such as that of consent. It would be of some comfort to Unionists in Northern Ireland were they to see an absolute commitment to the principle of consent coming from the Oireachtas. I ask that these issues be put down for discussion and that at least one of them be taken tomorrow.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. McDowell:</from>
          <p eId="para_16">Senator Hayes raised the issue of the incident in which a 17 year old young man was killed in the constituency I formerly represented in the other House. I am sure the Leader will join me in expressing condolences to his family and, although I do not want to pre-empt legal proceedings, expressing our shock that it appears that those responsible may well have been under age. It brings up the issue to which Senator Hayes alluded, the knife culture that has arisen in this city, but it also brings up another issue of broader import, the way the justice system deals with child offenders. I know that those living in my part of the city who have followed what recently happened with shock and horror will also want to be reassured that the mechanisms are in place whereby the offenders, if they prove to be under age, can be dealt with efficiently and properly by our juvenile justice system. The evidence of recent years suggests that this may not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Last week on the Order of Business we debated the issue of foreign policy, specifically in regard to Iraq. Perhaps the Leader, and the Minister who will address us shortly, will draw a similar conclusion to those of us on these benches from what happened at the weekend in Bali, namely, that the threat of international terrorism is still very much alive and that the international community should not go down the cul de sac of looking for a regime change in Iraq when that terrorist threat is so obviously present. Likewise, I am sure the House will join in sending condolences to the representatives of those countries whose natives were killed in Bali, particularly Australia.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke:</from>
          <p eId="para_18">Will the Leader notify the Minister for Education and Science of the crisis at third level, particularly in institutes of technology where many students are denied access to lectures due to insufficient personnel to provide them? First year students, in particular, who may have had a difficult transition from second to third level, have their woes compounded by this situation, although we are almost two months into the academic year. What will the Minister do with regard to providing proper education facilities for students who are in college from 9 a.m. until 7 p.m?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoryKiely" as="#Cathaoirleach" eId="spk_7">
          <from>An Cathaoirleach:</from>
          <p eId="para_19">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader? He can make a speech if he is granted a debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke:</from>
          <p eId="para_20">Will the Leader notify the Minister of the number of students denied the opportunity for education?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Mr. Norris:</from>
          <p eId="para_21">I join those who have called for a debate in regard to violence and the use of weapons, particularly among young people. I call for a separate debate on the related subject of the increasing problem of under age drinking and the rising levels of alcoholism. It is the responsibility of the drinks industry to play a positive role. It is targeting the most vulnerable groups all the time. The consumption of alcohol has skyrocketed in a way that is unimaginable in any other country in Europe. Scenes of public drunkenness and disorder are perfectly visible all over our principal cities and towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Will the Leader say when the Government will address the issue of libel? I read newspaper reports that legislation in this area was being drafted. The House will be interested in this, as I certainly will be. Many politicians are nervous when it comes to newspapers and newspaper editors, although I am not. I would be concerned if suggestions I have seen put abroad are contained in the legislation, namely, the shifting of the onus of proof on to the defendant and away from the newspapers. We need to be careful.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Mr. Norris:</from>
          <p eId="para_24">I thank the Cathaoirleach, but have two further small points to make. One is almost a housekeeping matter. I am sure Members have noticed that the interview room has suddenly disappeared without any advance warning. That fine room was very useful to Members for meetings, receiving delegations or making telephone calls. It has disappeared. I understand it has been grabbed by the Ceann Comhairle. Can this decision be reversed in the interests of Members?</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris:</from>
          <p eId="para_28">A distinguished reporter well known in the House, Chris Glennon, has retired as political correspondent of the Independent Group. He rarely reported on the Seanad, but was a fine reporter. I am sure we are sorry to see him go and wish him well in his retirement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan:</from>
          <p eId="para_29">I support Senator Brian Hayes's remarks about tomorrow's proposed Order Paper. It appears decidedly slack. I thought the Leader agreed last week that the House would debate the Flood report this week given that it was established by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Perhaps we should also have a debate on Northern Ireland, as suggested by Senator Hayes.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">The Government has announced its intention to create a corruption assets bureau to pursue assets gained by the corruption of politicians and public officials. How it is intended to distinguish it from the Criminal Assets Bureau? Will the Leader inform the House when it is intended to introduce the legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_31">We have witnessed leaks in recent days concerning the proposed national spatial strategy, with considerable speculation about the proposed major growth centres. I noted from the leaks that the Leader's constituency fared well.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne:</from>
          <p eId="para_37">Great minds think alike because I was about to raise the same issue as Senator Coghlan. I agree with what he said. The plan is to have six new cities, all in the northern half of the country. It is important we have a debate on decentralisation and the spatial strategy because it affects every area of life, especially transport, something of which I am aware because I am commuting again. I read with interest that it is considered desirable that 75% of all future jobs should be relocated.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to explain the Government's position on providing radiotherapy facilities in the regions, especially the south east? This issue concerning the Limerick region was raised previously by my colleague, Senator Finucane. The Minister would not meet Waterford City Council for a matter of months to discuss it. It was only when the council unanimously decided on Monday night last to bring their protest about this discourtesy to the Houses of the Oireachtas that the Minister agreed to meet it. He should come to the House and explain the Government's position regarding radiotherapy facilities.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry:</from>
          <p eId="para_41">Several Senators mentioned the increase in violence, especially among young people, and in under age drinking. I call on the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to explain why, at very short notice, he cancelled courses in both Trinity College, Dublin and University College Dublin for clinical psychologists, the very people who deal with such issues. There is a shortage of at least 50 clinical psychologists in health boards at present. There is also a shortage in the courts, the probation and welfare service and many other areas. When I asked the Minister for Education and Science, he knew nothing about this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">With such an apparent need within the services, particularly in view of the problems that have been pointed out by other Senators, it is extraordinary that the Minister for Health and Children should have abandoned these courses at two weeks notice. As I stated during the education debate last week, some people gave up jobs to take part in the courses and were left high and dry.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">I ask the Leader of the House to invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to the House to discuss IDA plans for attracting inward investment. To use a case study in the Milford area in Donegal, the IDA is trying to attract large-scale companies to a rural peripheral area, based on projections that there will be investment in services, broadband and roads. However, this is not happening and will not happen. I want the Tánaiste to tell us what are the IDA's plans and whether we are going down the right road in industrial investment. Maybe we should consider the creation of more indigenous jobs in rural areas.</p>

As the Cathaoirleach is aware, coming from an agricultural background, if this proposed closure goes ahead, there will be no fertilizer industry in this country. Hundreds of jobs in Cork and Wicklow will be lost and the Leader should make immediate representations to the Tánaiste on this crucial issue because, following a meeting with the Tánaiste on 12 September, the workers were led to believe that sufficient time would be allowed to bring in a plan to keep the factories open.</p>

I am aware that, in the last few days, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources listed various events which will be designated in future, but I am disappointed that people will have to watch a crucial match this evening on Sky Sports and will have to pay for that privilege. The Minister started consultations on the list last July, but he could not finalise the issue to include tonight's game. It is interesting that legislation referring to this matter was in both Houses in 1999 and one must ask why the Government delayed designating these events. I worry about what will happen in the future. Will the State be sued for negligence on this issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_53">Senator Finucane took the words out of my mouth when requesting a debate with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources regarding listed sports events. This would be timely given that this evening's game cannot be seen on terrestrial television. I also seek a debate with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.

          <p eId="para_58">There is no doubt that the Tánaiste is top of the poll for requests to come to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Senator Hayes and Senator O'Toole spoke broadly about the need for general statements and more attendance by Ministers to deal with issues and I agree. We discussed this at our parliamentary party meeting today and we decided that, after this week is over, we would attend to it. The Senators are right that it is not enough to meet for half a day on Wednesday and half a day on Thursday; that is not earning our keep. However, I need not spell out that this is because we were all busy with various matters and it might have been difficult to get various Ministers to attend. Hopefully, once this week is over, we will return to more regular sittings and take on board many of the issues which have been raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">There is the mechanism of the Adjournment Debate and three matters have been accepted for this evening. We could arrange to have three further matters raised on two other evenings, with a period set aside for definite statements on particular matters of State requiring attention. I appreciate the Senator's statement. We are aware of it on this side of the House and plan to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Senator Brian Hayes and Senator McDowell spoke about the sad event at the weekend involving the death of the young man. Murder is always awful, but this was a most poignant event, involving a young man legitimately enjoying himself and on his way home. It seemed so pointless and awful and we all sympathise with his family and friends. I share Senator McDowell's view that if it transpires that those involved in this crime were minors, there should be proper rehabilitative and remedial care for them. It was an awful event and nothing we say can make it any different.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">Senator O'Toole raised housing and asked that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government come to the House to deal with this issue before the situation gets out of hand. He also spoke about Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. I have spoken to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. He is keen to come to the House to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland and also Iraq. I hope that a date can be arranged as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Senator O'Toole and Senator McDowell also spoke about the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. They asked if an eye had been taken off the ball because of the concentration on Iraq and the terrible events in Bali.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Senator Ulick Burke asked that the Minister for Education and Science, should address the crisis, as he put it, in the institutes of technology. The Minister was in the House last week, but I will convey the Senator's comments to him. Each college is given its budget and it must work within it and plan for the year accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">Senator Norris spoke about under age drinking. I propose we deal with that issue when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is invited to the House. He has announced the setting up of a review group on the law of libel.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">I have no information about what happened regarding the interview room, but I will convey the Senator's views to the Superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">On behalf of the House, I bid farewell to Mr. Chris Glennon and offer our best wishes. He is a very fine example of the profession of journalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">Senator Coghlan asked about CAB. Legislation for CAB will be introduced and it will clearly mark out the difference between the earlier legislation and the proposed legislation.

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</from>
          <p eId="para_88">I take this opportunity on my first visit to the new Seanad to welcome new Members and to wish the Seanad well in its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">I welcome that we are meeting here today to consider the European Union (Scrutiny) Bill. The Government attaches great importance to addressing public concern relating to democratic accountability on EU issues. This was identified by the National Forum on Europe as a key issue in the aftermath of last year's referendum on the Nice treaty. I know that it is a concern which is shared by all Members of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">In recognition of these concerns the Government decided earlier this year, in consultation with the Oireachtas, to introduce new arrangements to enhance Oireachtas scrutiny of EU business and to improve accountability and transparency in relation to EU matters generally. The new agreed procedures, which came into effect on 1 July, provide for ongoing interaction between the Government and the Oireachtas throughout the EU legislative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">The Government, therefore, welcomes the EU (Scrutiny) Bill which is intended to place the essential thrust of the new procedures on a legislative basis. I pay tribute again to the Labour Party which initiated the Bill. We have been happy to work with it and others in reshaping the Bill to achieve an optimal level of accountability while, at the same time, enabling the Government to operate in the Council with the degree of flexibility necessary to ensure that the interests of the country are fully protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Section 1 of the Bill sets out clearly the wide range of measures be covered by the legislation. These include regulations and directives in the first pillar, joint actions and common positions in the second pillar, and all measures requiring the prior approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas under Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution, which embraces third pillar framework decisions and conventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">Section 2 sets out the essence of the scrutiny procedures and notably the action required by Ministers in relation to the measures listed in section 1. This section will require Ministers to lay the text of measures listed in section 1 of the Bill before each House of the Oireachtas, together with a statement outlining the content, purpose and likely implications for Ireland of the proposed measure and including other information as he or she considers appropriate. Subsection (2) stipulates that Ministers will have regard to any recommendations made by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Subsections (3) and (4) provide for cases of urgency – which in practice would be exceptional – where there is insufficient time to lay the text of a proposed measure before the Oireachtas in advance, in which case the Minister concerned will be obliged to do so afterwards, together with a statement outlining the implications for Ireland, the circumstances of its adoption and any other relevant information.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">There is also provision in subsection (5) of section 2 for a report by each Minister every six months in relation to measures, proposed measures and other EU developments relevant to their Departments. Such reports will provide an opportunity for Ministers to keep the Oireachtas informed of developments in relation to legislation which will already have been brought to the attention of the Oireachtas and on which views may have been expressed or may be pending.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">Section 3 is intended to provide for those exceptional occasions when it might be necessary to guarantee the confidentiality of EU proceedings. It is proposed that where this procedure is invoked, the Minister may make a report to the Oireachtas as he or she considers appropriate in the circumstances. This provision is necessary in view of the wide remit of the Act, which embraces all three pillars as well as proposals by member states under the second and third pillars. It is envisaged that it would only be used in exceptional circumstances and is most likely to arise in the CFSP and JHA areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Turning to section 4, Senators will be aware that the Government produces a report every six months on developments in the European Union in accordance with the terms of section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972. The report for the last six month period, 1 January-30 June 2002, was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this month and copies have been sent to all Members of the Oireachtas. In view of the new requirement in this legislation for reports from all Ministers to each House of the Oireachtas every six months, it is proposed that the Government's overall report should, in future, be produced on an annual basis. Such a report would provide a clear and informative summary of developments in the European Union in the preceding year.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Section 5 of the Bill is an amendment proposed by Fine Gael which the Government was happy to accept on Committee Stage in the Dáil. It provides for an annual report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation of the scrutiny arrangements in the preceding year. Such reports are a standard feature of scrutiny systems in other EU member states and will provide an opportunity to review the effectiveness of the scrutiny arrangements. The last section of the Bill is the usual short title and collective citation.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">I believe that this Bill will go a long way towards addressing the concerns that have been expressed with regard to democratic accountability in relation to EU matters. If effectively implemented it will give the Oireachtas an opportunity to influence the negotiations on legislative proposals from an early stage of the EU's legislative process. It will give Ireland one of the most advanced systems of parliamentary oversight in the European Union. It will be important that the Government and all Members of these Houses work closely together in implementing the new legislation effectively . This is an important long-term task for the Government and Oireachtas alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">While one of the main aims of the new legislation has been to ensure that the national interest is served by a balanced and informed interaction with the Oireachtas about EU legislation, it is also critical as necessary that the integrity and flexibility of Ireland's negotiating position be protected. This requirement is reflected in the Bill, for example in the provisions providing for exceptional cases of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">The Bill, as I indicated, builds on the existing system of Oireachtas scrutiny that has been in place since 1 July 2002. Some elements of the existing system are not explicitly reflected in the Bill as they are not appropriate to legislation but will continue to be implemented fully. Once the draft legislation and information notes from the Government have been submitted to the Oireachtas, it will be for the Oireachtas itself, through its relevant committees, to decide how it wishes to proceed in reviewing and examining the legislative proposal. A committee may choose to seek further hearings or seek the views of interested parties, including Ministers, officials, the social partners and other interested groups to assist in its examination of the legislation, so as to enable it to form an opinion on the proposal. Ministers will be obliged to have regard to any recommendations made by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">The arrangements introduced from 1 July for consultation between Ministers and relevant committees, notably in advance of meetings of the Council of Ministers and European Council, will continue. I have met the Select Committee on European Affairs several times in recent months in advance of meetings of the General Affairs and External Relations Council while the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform appeared before the select committee in advance of this week's meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council. These meetings have been useful and productive.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">Another element contained in the procedures introduced from 1 July, but which will not be included in legislation is the provision by the Government of information notes on Green and White Papers for the Oireachtas. This has not been explicitly defined in the draft legislation, as the focus of the Bill is primarily on legislative instruments. The Government will continue to provide information notes on Green and White Papers for the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">It may be of interest to note that since the new Oireachtas scrutiny system was introduced on 1 July, 67 legislative proposals have been tabled and 31 information notes have already been submitted to the Oireachtas. I understand that, following a review of these information notes, the scrutiny sub-committee of the Select Committee on European Affairs decided last Thursday to refer five of these notes to other committees for further examination and scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The amendments to the Defence Acts included in the original version of the Bill as tabled were removed from the Bill on Committee Stage because it was considered that they were quite separate and distinct from the issue of Oireachtas scrutiny of EU affairs and not appropriate to the Bill. Moreover, issues relating to defence and Ireland's policy of military neutrality are fully covered by the Seville Declarations and the proposed constitutional amendment which, in effect, preclude Ireland from entering an EU common defence policy and will require a "Yes" vote next Saturday for that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">I use the opportunity of this debate to comment on the next three final days of the Nice treaty referendum campaign. The Government has set out the many positive reasons we are asking for a resounding "Yes" vote for this important EU treaty of enlargement. All Europeans look expectantly to the Irish electorate in the hope we will confirm for them the view that the Irish are a generous people prepared to now make room for the applicant states in the European Union in the same way as room was made for us in 1973 to join the then European Economic Community as equal partners with the other member states. I do not for one moment believe we are a people who, having benefited so much from EU membership, are about to deny the same potential benefits of membership to others.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">There is a coincidence of interests involved in Ireland voting "Yes" for the ratification of the treaty. It is in our own interests to allow negotiations with the ten applicant states now deemed eligible by the European Union to be ready to conclude their negotiations for full membership within the timescale envisaged, that is, by the end of this year. We have an internationalised, open and competitive economy which depends for its continued growth on access to markets where we can sell our goods and services. Our economic history confirms that restricted markets in the past meant a restricted number of jobs fuelled by the historical legacy of structural unemployment, under-investment and mass emigration.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Membership of the European Union has provided for us the initial and necessary gateway to opportunity and national progress on an unprecedented scale. The European Union has been the means by which we have found a meaningful way to realise our ambitions as a people. It broadened our horizons, not just economically. It also helped to engender a sense of self-belief in our ability to manage our affairs with a real prospect of social as well as economic progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The real political context of the arguments about the merits of the treaty is that on the basis of the indisputable benefits that have accrued to Ireland from our engagement and participation in the European Union as a full and active member state, are we to deny to the ten applicant countries that same prospect of prosperity, stability and security which they are asking us to provide by voting "Yes" in this referendum? Will we show a commitment to the enlargement process by ratifying the only available legal basis agreed between the countries in order that those countries can become full EU members after successfully concluding their negotiations?</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Are we ready now, as a people, to take advantage of facilitating the successful conclusion of this historical political process in terms of our future relations with the member states of the European Union from which we can only derive further benefits or are we going to set our face against the enlargement process and by voting "No" create a huge dilemma by creating a degree of political and legal uncertainty as to how the enlargement can then proceed, with all the risks and downsides for Ireland that will be a consequence of a "No" vote, and do so in the sure knowledge that it will delay the enlargement for an indefinite period until an as still unknown solution is found with all the very negative and adverse political consequences that will undoubtedly flow in respect of the way Ireland's commitment to Europe is viewed, not only by the applicant states, but also by the existing members?</p>
          <p eId="para_111">Making the wrong choice for all the wrong reasons will be a very serious national setback. It would be at variance with the whole strategic direction our country must take in an increasingly interdependent and globalising world where our influence for good is best served by pursuing common policies for common objectives with like-minded states committed to peaceful co-existence and mutual co-operation on a scale and covering a comprehensive agenda unparalleled in terms of modern governance among a community of nation states anywhere in the world. If we are serious, as I believe we are, in seeking to use our influence for good on the major issues in our world, all of the empirical evidence confirms that we can best do this with other democratic states in this European Union of common values.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">The reality is that the time has come for us to show that we are prepared to give something back. Without being asked to disregard any of our essential interests, Ireland is being asked to allow the applicant states to shape their political destiny in a European Union of partnership, mutual respect and solidarity. That solidarity shown to us is further exemplified by the fact that the European Union totally respects our position on military neutrality, a position that will be copperfastened by a "Yes" vote which would see it being inserted into the Constitution for the first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">I want to outline what I believe should motivate our people as they consider this decision next Saturday. We have seen this week the importance of maintaining the momentum behind our own peace process. The European Union has provided consistent political as well as financial support totalling some €1.3 billion on cross-Border peace and INTERREG programmes as a measure of the practical help that the Union provides for communities in need, with all the employment spin-offs that such major resources signify.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">We have rightly seen those committed to the Agreement stress the absolute importance of not unpicking it. They recognise that the Agreement was hammered out between the parties and the two Governments after full discussion and analysis of all the issues came to those conclusions. Compromises were made to bring about the Agreement. It represents the finely balanced agreed positions of all the parties and the principles that inform it are partnership, inclusivity, equality and a recognition that all pursue their own legitimate and differing ultimate objectives by working together to implement the Agreement. The Agreement's supporters refute the rejectionist agenda, yet there are those in the "No" campaign in this referendum who take a totally different tack when it comes to the Nice treaty – in effect, Europe's agreement on enlargement. While they solemnly declare that Ireland's agreement, the Good Friday Agreement, must be implemented in full and not selectively picked at or eroded, the very opposite argument is used by them in relation to the Nice treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">The Nice treaty is the hard-won political compromise by 15 member state Governments. It, too, comes as a package. The greater good is shared by its full implementation rather than concentrating on those individual aspects about which people may have a reservation. No concern outweighs the importance of facilitating enlargement as agreed by the existing European Union and the applicant states. The Nice treaty provides the only mechanism in political and legal terms to facilitate that enlargement now. Let us grasp that opportunity. Just as we disagree with rejectionists in relation to Ireland's agreement, let us be consistent and also refuse to listen to the rejectionists of the Nice treaty – Europe's agreement on enlargement. If we favour enlargement, and we do, then let us logically vote for the only agreed basis by which it can happen, that is, the Nice treaty. There is no reason to believe that another treaty would provide us with better terms, should one be agreed. Indeed, all predictions are to the contrary.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">To those Little Irelanders who regard sovereignty as something to be stored away like a national treasure in a museum and to those, thankfully in a tiny minority, who think it resides in illegal arms dumps, I say that I am proud to be a constitutionalist who has seen those of our tradition, under proper and democratic authority, use their sovereignty intelligently with others to ensure that we are now the first generation since independence with every prospect of being educated and working and living in our own country. Half our generation is no longer being lost to foreign shores because of a proven lack of opportunity here. Now, from this strong position, with our proven ability to compete among the best the world can offer, are we to recoil from possibilities, shirk our responsibilities and allow ourselves to be mistakenly portrayed because of hesitation or doubt?</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Let us enthusiastically embrace the historic opportunity this referendum decision presents for us. Let us vote "Yes" to the consolidation of democracy in Europe and "Yes" to Ireland's full, active and committed participation in the enlarged European Union. Let us welcome the ten applicants to a Union that is committed to the right of all present and future member states to pursue their nations' interests democratically, peacefully and co-operatively.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">This Bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to greater openness, transparency and accountability in the EU legislative process, a commitment which I know is fully shared by the Oireachtas. It will enable the Oireachtas to play an enhanced role in the EU legislative process and, if effectively implemented, will give Ireland one of the most advanced systems of parliamentary oversight in the European Union. I therefore strongly commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_57">
          <from>Mr. McDowell:</from>
          <p eId="para_119">I thank the Minister for his contribution. We understand that he has other appointments this afternoon but we appreciate his and the Government's support for the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The Minister, particularly in his concluding remarks, dwelt at some length on the issue of the Nice treaty referendum which faces us this weekend. We had the opportunity to debate this in the House before and I will not dwell on it at great length, but I have one focal scoir. Let there be no doubt that this treaty is important and that it is about enlargement. If we take them at face value the Trotskyists, ultra-nationalists and neo-fascists who form the core of vocal opposition to the treaty in Ireland apparently believe that it is about something else. The rest of us know, however, that one would be hard put to find anybody from Holyhead to Istambul who agrees with that analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">It will simply not be possible for any representative of the Irish people this day next week to say to the rest of our colleagues on this Continent that the Irish people voted against the Nice treaty for reasons which have nothing to do with enlargement. This is about enlargement: if we reject Nice it will rightly be construed as a rejection of enlargement by the Irish people. We are in a pivotal position, one in which we have never found ourselves before. The people are making a decision in which our national interest is scarcely at stake, but which will hugely affect the rest of the Continent and determine its future. We have the opportunity, as the Minister says, to do a lot of good, to take away that last brick in the Berlin wall, as it has been put. We also have an unparalleled and unprecedented opportunity to screw up the rest of the Continent. I hope that before people decide how to vote they will contemplate not just our own self-interest – which is on all our minds to a greater or lesser extent – but also the greater good of the rest of the Continent.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">To put the Bill in context, after the defeat of the first Nice referendum last year my party said that it would support putting the same or a similar question to the people again if three preconditions were met. The first, on which I readily concede that the Government accommodated us, was the establishment of the Forum on Europe. The second dealt with the issue of neutrality. As the Minister, who has now left us, knows, we were happy to deal with him and his officials in advance of the promulgation of the amendment which is to be put to the people. We were satisfied to support the amendment because, for the first time, it gives the people singular sovereignty on the issue of neutrality, particularly in regard to participation in mutual defence arrangements. I would support such an arrangement if the conditions were right but it is now explicitly a matter for the people to decide in good time if such proposals are made. Strictly speaking, therefore, it is not part of the Nice treaty debate as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">The Bill before us relates to the scrutiny of what is happening at EU level. If one looks back at our participation in the EU debate over the past 30 years there is no doubt there are great deficiencies in the way we have done business. I was a member of the sub-committee on secondary EU legislation in the early 1990s and I must confess that it was one of the most unrewarding jobs I ever did. We were totally and constantly snowed under with so much paper which usually was not accompanied by any executive summary or information document. It was impossible for a small committee of four or five Members of the Houses to come to terms with what was being proposed. The procedure did not work and the committee either ceased to function or was abolished. Its functions now, at least in theory, come under the Committee on European Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The issue we are seeking to address is that of the democratic deficit. Before we go any further we must identify the reasons for the democratic deficit, not all of which have to do with this Bill or this House. The reality is that many people do not engage with European issues because they are not interested in them. The reality is that there is also a deficit in this country in terms of political debate. Those of us who like to debate matters of policy know that it can be quite difficult to get any public attention or attention from the media on these issues. This has nothing to do with whether the issue has to do with European Union matters. There is a general malaise about politics in this country which we have debated previously and which is very dispiriting.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">There is also a tendency to blame Brussels for everything. It is a fairly common practice for Irish Ministers, or, for that matter, Ministers of other governments, to go to Brussels, say their piece, frequently know the outcome and afterwards blame the process, the Commission or the bureaucrats in Brussels for something they may have agreed to or which they only formally opposed in the first instance. By our rhetoric and the way in which we treat Brussels almost like a whipping boy, we necessarily create a democratic deficit about which we then complain.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The real problem with the democratic deficit is how the Union works, that is, the whole business of intergovernmentalism. The reality is that most legislation at European Union level is decided by the Council of Ministers in private or by prior negotiation. This is in complete contrast to the way national government works. In this country there is less division of powers than applies in most other countries where the Executive and the Legislature can be on occasion almost the same thing. We know the Executive or the Government in Ireland effectively makes all decisions in relation to legislation and that the Houses of the Oireachtas effectively hold it to account only to the extent that Ministers are required to come in and shepherd legislation through the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Decisions taken by civil servants, Ministers and the Cabinet almost always get translated fairly rapidly and almost without amendment into legislation as passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Therefore, our Legislature is a good deal weaker than in most other European countries. Nonetheless, it is still a good deal stronger than the way in which we deal with European legislation. When we deal with European legislation, the matter is decided by the Council of Ministers. It is then effectively handed down to the individual parliaments who have no alternative but to translate it into national legislation without amendment, a process which is unsatisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">This Bill seeks to introduce some measure of accountability and transparency into this process. It seeks to do so in the first instance by requiring that Ministers should provide written information to a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas which can then be disseminated to other committees dealing with relevant areas. It then requires that the particular Minister dealing with the issue should take into account the views expressed by the particular committee and the Houses of the Oireachtas. It also requires that the Minister should report back following any decision taken at European level in regard to legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">On the face of it, this is a fairly cumbersome procedure which will only work if there is good faith all round. It would be possible for Ministers to circumvent or undermine the procedure if they wished. There are a number of opt-outs in the legislation which I acknowledge could be seen as a weakness. It relies on the Minister using the discretion granted to him or her by the Bill in a fashion which is within the spirit of the Bill. One could decide that everything is urgent, therefore there is no need to bring anything to the committee. One could decide that everything it is convenient to label confidential should be labelled confidential. Therefore it would be possible, if a Minister really wanted, to avoid this process altogether, which would be a tragedy. I accept the bona fides of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who in recent months have tried to work a process which is similar to this. I accept their bona fides in accepting the Bill and in saying they will operate within the spirit intended. It is in all our interests that this should happen. It is not a party political issue as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">Regarding some of the specifics of the Bill, two characteristics apply. One is the requirement on Ministers to consult, pay attention and take into account what is said and the other is the requirement to give information. I want to emphasise that it deals with all three pillars of the Union's activities. It deals not just with the core activities, but with Justice and Home Affairs and with the CFSP. These tend to be areas where more controversial decisions are taken. While I appreciate there is a problem about legislation because much legislation does not necessarily arise in these areas, it is important that the process outlined in the Bill should apply also to these elements of the Union's activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">There are broader issues which will need to be dealt with in time in regard to the competency of national parliaments and subsidiarity. These are important aspects but they are not appropriate for this Bill. We need to decide what national parliaments do and what issues need to be decided at local, national and regional level. There is still too much doubt about the level at which issues should be dealt with within the European Union. That is not the case in the United States where everyone knows what the state does and what is done at federal level. We do not yet know that, but obviously these issues will be taken up in the context of the convention. I said last week when the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, was here that I believe there is a serious element of treaty fatigue and I hope the convention and those involved, either peripherally or centrally, will take the opportunity to bring us to end point and that we will have a basic law which, among other things, will set out the competencies of the various levels of government that operate within the European Union. Without that certainty and clarity, the democratic deficit will be inevitable in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">I welcome the contribution made by the Minister here and in the other House and the fact that a Bill initiated by the Opposition has been accepted by the Government. I believe this illustrates that the Government is serious in its efforts to bring the operation of the European institutions closer to the people and closer to this House. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford:</from>
          <p eId="para_135">I welcome the Bill, as did my party in the other House. We attempted on Committee Stage to table constructive amendments, some of which were accepted. I was very happy to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in the House and I compliment him on his efforts to date in regard to the Nice treaty referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">The Minister ended his remarks on the legislation by conveying further words of wisdom on the broader matter of the Nice treaty. We are having this debate and discussing this proposal because of the outcome of the first Nice treaty referendum, which was a surprise defeat. There was a willingness among all the political parties to ask themselves some searching, fundamental questions as to the reason the first referendum on the treaty was rejected by the people last year. They all responded in their own particular ways, but the Labour Party responded by publishing the European Union (Scrutiny) Bill, 2001. It is welcome that it was accepted at the time by the Government as a meaningful response to what the people had said by their negative vote last year. That is the backdrop to this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">One issue that arises continually, not only when discussing this legislation but also when discussing broader European issues, politics and proposals, is that of the democratic deficit. Those two words have taken on a new currency. All of us who spoke on the Nice treaty a fortnight or three weeks ago mentioned the democratic deficit as if it were only a European issue and problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">I attended a Fine Gael public meeting on the Nice treaty last night and was most impressed by the contribution of former MEP and Labour Party Deputy, Brendan Halligan. One of the issues he addressed was that of the democratic deficit and our almost unanimous view that there is some sort of democratic deficit in Europe from which we are all suffering. He challenged us to ask ourselves if the democratic deficit was greater in European politics than at home. He posed a very valid point that, within the structures of Europe, there is absolute media access, not just to the Parliament, certain Commission meetings or committee meetings, but even also to the meetings of the various European political party groupings. He asked if we are ever likely to see the day when the media will be allowed attend a meeting of the Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Labour Party parliamentary parties. There is media access to a high level within the European structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">Perhaps we are getting carried away by the concept of the democratic deficit and not sufficiently interested in reading what is going on and generating further media reports from Europe on important issues. The legislation before us will obviously force us in the Oireachtas to take on board, in a very detailed way, proposals coming from Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Is the Minister confident that, within the structures proposed, namely, the Joint Committee on European Affairs, we have sufficient resources to meet this challenge? I was interested in what he said about developments since July. He made the point that since 1 July 2002, 67 legislative proposals have been tabled and 31 information notes submitted to the Oireachtas. That is a huge workload for the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I am not sure of the staffing levels of that committee or its broader membership, but there is little point in us enacting this very worthwhile legislation and implementing the proposals that will stem therefrom if we cannot actually make it work.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The Joint Committee on European Affairs will certainly be the most important committee of this House if what is contained in this Bill is to work. However, there is a challenge for us in ensuring it will have sufficient resources to do its work. Given that it has so many items of information before it since 1 July, it would almost need to meet on a daily basis over a 12 month period if it were to scrutinise all the documentation. Let us insist that we will meet the requirements of the committee, both in terms of staffing and membership. I understand there is already a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on European Affairs attempting to sift through the various proposals.</p>

I was a member of a similar committee in the early part of my parliamentary existence and there was too much documentation coming through. Therefore, Members and committees will have to prioritise. However, I accept that it involves a new workload and that new resources will be required.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford:</from>
          <p eId="para_143">I welcome the informal and helpful intervention of the Minister of State, something very new to me in this House. I look forward to seeing that work and the Joint Committee on European Affairs taking on board all its new responsibilities. It will make politics and membership of the Oireachtas very interesting and could be a forerunner to major changes in the way we do our business.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The Minister stated there would be a long-term challenge for us all. He made the point, with which I fully agree, that the Government and all Members of the House will have to work closely together in a new fashion because of this legislation. It will be very new to us to see all these European issues being addressed and teased out at the committee and, presumably, being sent to the various other Oireachtas committees and Ministers for scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">When the legislation is in place, we will have no excuse for pretending we have no input or that everything bad stems from Brussels. It has almost become common to claim negative and nasty decisions were made in Brussels. Ultimately, we have sufficient strength and powers in this House to legislate for our own affairs. I hope we will begin to look at the question of the democratic deficit in a new light and realise that there is no great super plan at Brussels level to keep us ignorant of policy measures and proposals and that we will now be playing a full role in debating and making our own decisions in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The Minister of State may be aware that the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, was here last week. It was an excellent morning in terms of our receiving information. Mr. Cox's presentation was very enlightening and showed how the Seanad can work very effectively. Obviously, stemming from the Bill before us, the Select Committee on European Affairs, its various sub-committees and other Oireachtas committees will have a very major role to play in scrutinising European legislation. There is still a strong and separate role for the Seanad to be seen as a vehicle for debate and dialogue at the highest level on issues of European policy. In that regard, I hope last week's visit by the President of the European Parliament will be a forerunner to other such debates because it was certainly worthwhile from all our points of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">I support the legislation and demand that we ensure it works by giving the various committees the resources they need. I also support what the Minister said in relation to Saturday's vote. Perhaps in this House we are speaking to the converted. That is the message we got when we debated the Nice treaty some weeks ago, but on Saturday we will be facing the most important electoral test for this generation of politicians and the country. We can change Governments, Deputies and Senators from time to time, but the decision we take on Saturday will have a profound impact on this and the next generation of Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">I reiterate what the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, said last week when he appealed from the bottom of his heart to the people to be broad-minded, generous and open-hearted in the decision they take on Saturday. A "Yes" vote is of absolute importance. I hope everybody on the "Yes" side of the argument will, in these last few days prior to the referendum, continue to counter the spurious arguments and campaign methods of some on the "No" side. This will help to ensure that the people will make a positive decision on Saturday not just for the future of Europe, but also for this country.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_63">
          <from>Mr. McHugh:</from>
          <p eId="para_149">I thank Senator Bradford for sharing his time. I welcome this Bill which gives me more confidence in the European project. I was one of the 18% of voters who voted "No" in the last referendum because of a lack of confidence in the scrutiny of European measures by the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is understandable why people in my home area of Donegal lack confidence in the European project. For example, a consortium of business people attempted to process a planning application for the construction of a golf course on sand dunes in north west Donegal. Their application was turned down because of European Union directives covering protection of fauna in the area. This sent negative signals to people in the local community, including myself, who were envisaging building hotels and leisure facilities which would have created tourism and employment opportunities, thus helping to secure the sustainable development of their area. We questioned the legitimacy of the authority of these directives, taking the view that the central authority in Dublin should not be obliged to treat Donegal any differently from other regions in the country. In view of this, the Bill is welcome as it will afford me the opportunity to scrutinise legislation, proposals and directives from the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Another example of European Union bureaucracy concerns local restaurateurs in my home town. They get endless lists of conditions and requirements from the health boards, which emanate from Europe, often covering as many as 40 or 50 health and safety conditions that must be met before they can welcome members of the public to their premises. It does little for confidence in the European process, especially when those affected travel on holiday to other European Union countries, such as France, and find cats and dogs in restaurants. I hope this Bill will address this aspect and help to reduce the democratic deficit in the European project.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">The Minister pointed out how much Ireland has benefited from European Union membership. He said it had provided Ireland with the initial and necessary gateway to opportunity and that Ireland should be prepared to give something back. This dependency model evoked by the Minister should be compared to that of the dole man, or, to be politically correct, the dole woman.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">A position of dependency on hand-outs does not instil confidence in the recipient. I have yet to hear a person on the dole say that, while on the dole, he or she respected the social welfare system. Respect will not be engendered if the language of dependency is used to describe Ireland's relationship with the European Union. We also contributed and were involved in the development of the European project. We were not merely bit-part players.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The centralisation of our Government system does not instil confidence in people living in rural areas. The same can be said for the European project, which starts in Brussels and stops in Dublin. We should proceed beyond this legislation and decentralise our European project. There should be offices in regions around the country, such as Donegal, Waterford and Kerry. People must see what the European Union is about because, at present, they have no tangible evidence of what it does. There are infrastructure benefits, such as regional colleges, of which the Letterkenny Institute of Technology is an example. However, while these are European Union funded projects, citizens see them as the consequences of spending taxpayers' money. In view of this, offices should be established in each county council to enable people explore how much the Union contributes to projects in their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">Doubtless, hundreds of thousands of euro have been spent on consultants explaining the democratic deficit and why, at the last referendum, 65% of the electorate did not vote. They did not vote because of their lack of confidence in the European project. It is meaningless to them. In this context the term "subsidiarity", referred to by Senator McDowell, is important. It is concerned with devolving power to the regions and giving them more autonomy. The Leas-Chathaoirleach referred to the BMW region. While it exists in theory, it has little practical significance. If we are to develop along the lines of the <i> Länder</i> system in Germany or the regions in Scandinavian countries, we will have to fully implement proper constitutional arrangements for our regions, be it at county council or regional level.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I welcome the Bill, the timing of which is excellent. According to the latest opinion poll on the Nice referendum, 31% of voters are still undecided. We must tell them that the European project is evolving. We are trying to change the way we operate in Europe, but it will not be easy. Given this, we should be careful not to slag "No" voters. While the "No" campaigners are misleading the public, they are tapping into apathetic voters, those who find Europe meaningless. We should stop slagging them because there is a reason that, on the last occasion, 65% of the electorate did not vote and why, today, 31% of voters are undecided about how they will vote on Saturday.</p>

          <from>Ms Ormonde:</from>
          <p eId="para_157">I am my party's spokesperson on European affairs and I am on a learning curve. I am a good listener and I have decided to put away my prepared script and speak about the little knowledge I gleaned from the two Nice referendum campaigns. There is an element of truth in the view that the first referendum was lost because of dissatisfaction with the democratic deficit and with the fact that decisions affecting us all are taken in Brussels. I asked myself how much I knew about Europe and began to take a deeper interest in the issue. Fortunately, I was appointed to the Forum on Europe, but I still have much reading and listening to do on how best to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">This is an excellent Bill, which provides us with an opportunity to scrutinise in the Oireachtas any proposals coming from Brussels. The work will be undertaken by a joint Oireachtas committee. I strongly welcome the Bill and compliment the Labour Party on initiating it. It is heartening to see a consensus on this issue. We are all singing the same tune in regard to how best we can go forward and connect with the public. Our efforts in regard to having the proposals and legislation coming from Brussels monitored and scrutinised will help Sean Citizen to know what is going on in Europe. I was worried about that issue but it has been delightful to go out on the campaign and say that we are putting new structures in place and that we have formed the forum on Europe to discuss the future of Europe. We will take heed of what is being said.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House. His appointment is a clear indication of the commitment of the Government to European affairs. This is an intrinsic part of how we analyse and monitor proposals that are coming from Europe as well as aid in designing a Europe of the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Last week we initiated a debate on Seanad reform. I have not yet had an opportunity to speak on this subject but one of the proposals is very close to my heart – that the Seanad should have a major role in the important task of surveillance and monitoring of EU developments. We could play a watchdog role. Perhaps MEPs could visit this House and inform us in regard to issues of trade and commerce and living standards so that all citizens understand how the European Union works and how matters are debated in that forum. That would also have the benefit of enhancing the role of the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">I welcome the fact that the joint Oireachtas committee is to take on the role of scrutinising all issues pertaining to Europe. I encountered many councillors on the campaign trail for the recent Seanad election who expressed the view that directives on habitats, the quality of water, meat and so on were all made in Europe without any input from us. I had to agree that there was something not quite right in that. All of these matters should be teased out before they go to the Council of Ministers. This would allow the views of the public to be taken into account by their public representatives in our national Parliament. That is the way forward. Unfortunately people were mixing up the two issues – what the Nice treaty is about and the future of Europe. The second matter is what we are addressing today in putting new structures in place to connect with the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">I have put some thought into how I would like to see the forum for Europe shaping up. Ireland needs to generate its own ideal and model for the future institutional development of the European Union. There is also a need for greater Oireachtas involvement in European affairs. It is high time for a comprehensive debate on the nature of the emerging European Union and perhaps a debate on the risks associated with opting out of any discussion on its future direction. These are all areas that can soon be debated but the immediate issue is to get the referendum on the Nice treaty passed because none of this may exist if we do not. We will certainly be seen as isolationist if the treaty is rejected.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">I wish the Minister of State here every success on Saturday. Hopefully we will get a resoundingly positive result. We should not go cold on Europe. We have a golden opportunity after Saturday's vote to go ahead with a debate on where we go from here. We are already putting in place this Bill which will start the scrutiny mechanism for future monitoring of EU decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Let us get a "Yes" vote for the Nice treaty and the rest will fall into place. There is a commitment by the Government, and by all parties across the board, to ensure that the forum on Europe will provide a successful route for our future in Europe. We will also have the Seanad as a watchdog to monitor legislation and the powers of the joint Oireachtas committee will be enhanced to ensure that any proposals or Bills that come from Brussels will be scrutinised so that the public at large will connect with the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Let us hope that the media will take an interest and recognise the Trojan work that is being done both in this House and by the joint Oireachtas committee. Maybe when this fact is recognised people will make the link between the European Parliament, the national Parliament and the public at large. It is only if we all work together that the public will feel its role has been enhanced and that the democratic deficit will no longer exist.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_67">
          <from>Mr. Quinn:</from>
          <p eId="para_166">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche. I have just come back from abroad. It is interesting that at the food industry meetings I attended in the past, people enthusiastically turned to me across the table impressed that I was from Ireland, "that smashing country that is doing so well". This time those same people turned to ask what is going to happen on Saturday. These were not just Europeans but people from around the world who are aware of what is happening and of its importance. As far as they were concerned we were letting down the rest of Europe by being greedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I was impressed by the way debate on the Bill was introduced by the Minister, and Senator McDowell also, explaining the link between it and the referendum. I spoke at the forum for Europe – I think the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, was there at the time – about one of the instances that influenced me this year in regard to the referendum last year. Of those I spoke to last year after the referendum a number of people said they had voted "No" because they thought that we, as a small nation, were losing out. This year I had a visit from a group of Gaullist Party supporters from France. One of them spoke about the upcoming referendum and asked me how I was going to vote, to which I replied I would be voting "Yes". He said he was disappointed because the French were unhappy about the Nice treaty since it is giving all the power to the small nations. I realised that when one gets a group of different nationalities together – and the Minister explained it very well today in regard to the Northern Ireland treaty – that when one gets locked together in a room for a few days and one emerges with something nobody is really pleased with, then that is probably the best solution. The Nice treaty does not satisfy anyone. It is not the ideal solution with which everyone will be happy. However, I was impressed that the French Gaullists were unhappy that too much power was being given to small nations and that larger ones were losing power.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">I know there is a link – the Minister has explained it very well, as has Senator McDowell – between the Bill and the Nice treaty referendum on Saturday. I welcome the Bill in so far as it is better than nothing, but it is not enough and will do little or nothing to address the question of scrutiny and the gap which has become especially obvious since the referendum on the Nice treaty last year. It was to address that gap that the Labour Party introduced this measure as a Private Members' Bill, but this cut-down, emasculated version the Government seeks to rush through into law almost on the eve of the new referendum will not fill the gap. If anything, it will serve to increase the cynicism felt by any voter for whom the gap in scrutiny is an issue. This measure will not revolutionise the way we approach our relationship with Europe. To that extent, it will fail. A revolution is exactly what we need. We need to do something more than the Bill to create a healthy relationship between the people and the European Union to which I hope sincerely we will pledge our allegiance on Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The sad truth is that for 30 years our attitude could have been summed up by the phrase "grab the money and run". Instead of seeking to involve the people in the myriad of decisions concerning Europe, successive Governments judged that the best way to keep voters on side was to wave cheques at them. The brand image of Europe projected by every Government since we entered in 1973 was one of the gravy train which was given as the reason we should be involved in Europe. Time has shown this to be a short-sighted policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">When the gravy train has run into the buffers we have discovered that, among the various peoples of the Europe Union, the Irish are the most ignorant about what has been happening. They are the least interested in the issues affecting the future of the European Union. With the cheques rapidly becoming a thing of the past, many do not know what Europe is for. It is little wonder that, when the people were called on to vote on the Nice treaty last year, the vast majority did not understand what was going on. This was not just because of a complacent Government which failed to campaign effectively in favour of the treaty last year, something it recognises it failed to do, it was just as much the fruit of 30 years of keeping the people on the sidelines where European issues were concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">I am not so naive as to imagine that the difficulty of involving the people of Europe was the fault of successive Governments to apply effective scrutiny to European affairs. The democratic deficit to which Senators Bradford and Ormonde referred is an issue throughout the Union and it is right that it is high on the agenda of the European Convention which is seeking to draw a road map for the future development of the European Union. Whereas others have failed to a greater or lesser extent, we in Ireland have failed abysmally. One only has to read the regular statistics from EUROSTAT to see the truth of this. For example, Ireland repeatedly scores highly in terms of approval of membership of the European Union. However, when it comes to knowledge of EU institutions and interest in the issues which concern them, our scores are consistently among the lowest. This bears out what I said about the 30 years of mismanaging the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Our traditional approval of EU membership has been generated by the gravy train to which I referred and the repeated cheque waving in which we have been involved. Our lack of knowledge and interest in matters European have been generated by our consistent failure to look beyond the cheques and benefits we received and our refusal to do anything more than put our feet up and enjoy wherever the gravy train was going to take us. That is what we need to change and we need to do it quickly. It must be immediate. We do not have time to relax on it. That is the reason we need a revolution in the way we approach the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The referendum on Saturday, whatever way it goes, will not be the end of the story. If we vote "Yes," as I hope we will, it will not be the last time the people will be asked to vote on Europe. Less than three years from now we will be faced with the need to approve another new treaty which will be much more wide-ranging and fundamental in its implications than anything in the Nice treaty. If by the time of the next referendum all the changes we have made in the way we approach the European Union are contained in the tiny Bill before us, we should not be surprised if the people in 2005 show the same lack of knowledge and interest as they did last year and which, according to the Referendum Commission, they still show a year later.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Between the lines of the Bill I see two baleful influences working together. The first is the customary struggle between the Executive and the Legislature which we have discussed. Whenever it gets the chance, each Government seeks to sideline Parliament and reduce its influence. It is an unnecessary policy in a system such as ours where the Government always has a majority in both Houses. It is a foolish policy which does not make sense because it creates an unnecessary barrier between the Government and the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Added to that influence is another equally negative influence, namely, the struggle of the bureaucrats to control everything which relates to and must be done with the European Union. Any Ministers who have had dealings with Europe will say all the real decision-making is in the hands of officials with the politicians wheeled in at the last minute to dot the "i's" and cross the "t's".</p>

In this case, the Government and the officials are singing from the same hymn book and the song is called, Hands off the EU. Scrutiny is skirted around in the Bill by the use of qualifications such as "as far as practicable," by reservations about matters deemed to be confidential and by a refusal to include the notion of a negotiating mandate which would be set by the Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">While this is a worthy Bill, it is a pathetic attempt to con the public into thinking that things have changed fundamentally in the way we deal with European affairs. The sad truth is that they have not changed and we will have to ensure we find a method beyond the Bill to ensure they change in the years ahead.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes:</from>
          <p eId="para_179">As chairman of the National Forum on Europe, I pay tribute to all the parties for having readily accepted the points made in the first report of the forum regarding scrutiny in the Oireachtas of European business. It is important that we pass the Bill today and do not wait to improve it, as many think it could be improved, to ensure this term's business can proceed. Like Senator Quinn, I hope we regard it as a beginning rather than a closed chapter. For that reason, I am glad to see the Bill provides a clause for its revision whereby we can examine at the end of the year how it has worked. It needs to be widened and deepened and when we consider the reform of the Seanad I hope we will see how the Seanad might play a much richer and fuller role, not only in the scrutiny of business but also in pre-Green Paper broad thematic discussions.<i/>On the detail of the Bill, when Ministers have used the urgent procedure or the confidential procedure and supplied information as they think fit, it would be helpful if that information were to include a statement of the reasons it was deemed proper on that occasion to use that procedure. I fully accept the need for flexibility and confidentiality and – I hate to say it – for a rapid response on these things.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">This Bill if fully implemented it will put great strain on the committees and the resources of the Houses. Unless the committees are properly serviced and the resources are put into research and back them up, it will not be possible to do this. In the Bill and the supporting paper, there is no reference to cost, but I hope that will not be overlooked. In terms of the general administration of the Houses, sufficient resources need to be put in to enable all these committees to carry out new, onerous and, for many of us, innovative duties. Having said that, I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Labour Party on having introduced it.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">On behalf of the forum, I am grateful to all the Members for accepting at least the spirit of the recommendation and trying to give it flesh.</p>

        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_71">
          <from>Mr. Cummins:</from>
          <p eId="para_182">I support this excellent Bill which, as has been said by other Senators, is not before time. We should have had a Bill on the scrutiny of the EU long before now. There is obviously a need for the Commission and the other EU institutions to make their own communication with EU states and the general public in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Much more simple language should be used in many EU communications. I have spoken at length on this subject to several members of EU institutions. While they all agree that we should have more simplified language, nothing seems to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">I have been a member of the European Committee of the Regions for the past five years. In that period, I have met many colleagues from the ten accession countries that are to join the EU. They were taken aback by our rejection of the Nice treaty, as were friends of ours from the present 15 member countries. They wanted to know why Ireland would not agree to reforming the institutions to allow for enlargement. That is what the Nice treaty is about, nothing more and nothing less. Many people have tried to muddy the waters and introduce red herrings into the debate, but that is the nub of the story.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">It is essential that in the remaining days of the debate before the treaty is decided upon by the people, all of us on the "Yes" side should continue at every possible opportunity to nail the lies that are being told every day in the campaign by those on the "No" side. It is important that we continue to do that up to polling day, because people on the other side will continue to spin out red herrings between now and then.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">In reading the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, it appears that the scrutiny will happen quite late in the process. I believe this will happen at the decision stage of the Council. I am not very experienced at reading Bills and may be misreading it, but this is a fundamental issue for me and represents the difference between a rubber-stamping exercise and real scrutiny of European affairs. I hope scrutiny can begin at an early stage when the Green Papers and White Papers are introduced. Last year's White Paper on governance was an excellent one and the Oireachtas should scrutinise such papers in order to influence the initial stages of the legislative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">A number of EU process co-ordinating policies such as health, social inclusion, immigration policy, pensions, etc. are only presented via non-legislative communications and this Bill should not exclude us from scrutinising these issues. It is important that we have such scrutiny of European affairs by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_72">
          <from>Mr. Dardis:</from>
          <p eId="para_188">I propose to share my time with Senators Mansergh and O'Rourke. This Bill is long overdue and were it not for the rejection of the Nice treaty in the last referendum, we could still be waiting for it. In 1997 the all-party committee on the Constitution under the chairmanship of Deputy O'Keeffe stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The committee believes the Seanad could play a major role in ensuring this important task is carried out [that is, the task of scrutinising European legislation]. Provision could be made to have MEPs take part in debates in this House, although without voting rights [the appearance of European Parliament president, Mr. Cox here was part of that]. Relevant EU Commissioners and senior EU Commission officials could be invited to the House for discussions on the EU's legislative programme [we have had some of that] and the Seanad could monitor EU regulations and directives and produce reports for the Dáil on the impact of and trends in that legislation. It seems to the committee that if the Seanad tackles such a task with imagination, energy and high critical power, it could convey to the people in clear realistic terms what the European dimension adds to our lives and offer sound advice on how the State should seek to shape EU policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">It is quite concise and that report has been there since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The debate centres on whether this House or the Committee on European Affairs should oversee the scrutiny. I submit that both should be involved. I take the point forcefully made by Senator Maurice Hayes that without resources, nothing can be done. There is a large corpus of legislation, regulations and directives emanating from Europe and only in the Seanad does the manpower exist to deal effectively with this. We have the time and we should do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">There is a need for scrutiny, but there is a greater need for accountability within the system. I do not share the view commonly expressed here that there is a democratic deficit within Europe. If anything the democratic deficit exists at home.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_73">

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_74">
          <from>Mr. Dardis:</from>
          <p eId="para_194">There is not a democratic deficit; there is a different institutional way of doing things in Europe. The democratic system operates within the fact that the Commission proposes the legislation. There are some powers of initiation for the parliament. The Council, which represents the people of the Union, disposes; the parliament expresses its view and in the case of the budget it can veto. There is a democratic balance in the system although this has been somewhat eroded by the fact that it is very convenient for Ministers – not just in this country but universally in the Union – to come home and say that all the good news was their doing and all the bad news emanated from the faceless bureaucrats in Brussels.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">That is part of the reason for the widespread feeling that there is a democratic deficit. There is a deficit in so far as we have not reviewed European matters to the extent we should and we have not engaged either the media or the people on European matters. We do not have to reinvent the wheel, as there are models available like the Finnish process, which comes back to accountability. Before a Minister goes to a Council meeting at European level, he or she must come before a committee of the Finnish Parliament and explain what he or she is dealing with at the meeting. A direction is given by the Parliament to the Minister as to how to deal with the issue and the Minister must report back on returning home. That is a degree of accountability a million miles away from our system but it would bear examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The next question relates to who does the work. I have quoted what Deputy O'Keeffe's committee had to say about the Seanad's role. I was a member of the committee chaired by Deputy Lenihan, which had similar views and there is also the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I am glad that we have finally recognised the importance of these matters by the appointment of Deputy Roche as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs. We should have such an appointment a long time ago, as it would be unusual for any member state not to have a Minister dealing with European affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">I pay tribute to the work of the National Forum for Europe under Senator Maurice Hayes, in particular for bringing the Forum around the country in a roadshow, which brought matters in Europe down to the level of the ordinary citizen. Some of those issues are very arcane and are debated by experts using jargon, which is part of the exclusion. It is frequently said that there is an information deficit in Europe but there is not; there is a deluge of information but there is a comprehension deficit. Nobody can understand phrases like the three pillars and subsidiarity. We are not sure ourselves what subsidiarity and devolving power to the most appropriate level mean and the Forum has been useful in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Resources are very important. The institutions of the European Union are a model of openness in many respects compared to what we have here. One can walk in off the street into the European Parliament and sit down to listen to any of its committees. Pretty much everything is out in the open. One of our problems is that we have a way of doing things which we inherited from the mother of Parliaments and we have never looked beyond our nearest island to see that there are other models and ways to work. The consensus model is much more common in European politics than the adversarial model we are accustomed to.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">As other Members, I hope we will adopt the treaty in the referendum on Saturday. It is interesting that those who oppose the treaty on the basis of the threat to neutrality have the vehicle within the questions being put on Saturday to ensure neutrality is protected in the triple lock, to use some jargon. In other words, without a UN mandate and the will of the Oireachtas and the Irish people we cannot participate in many of the tasks, even simple tasks such as the Petersberg Tasks.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">I have not had time to expand on the matter of bureaucracy but there is a distinction between what the Council decides and implementation. The European free range hen is a very odd animal. The European free range hen on a farm in County Cork leaves its dormitory and goes to a field. At the end of the day it comes back and because it passed some concrete on the way from where it slept to where it fed and back again, it cannot be regarded as a free range hen.</p>

          <p eId="para_203">Senator Cummins mentioned the gap at Commission level and there is something to that. However, regarding the adoption of the Nice treaty, this country does not have the right to say to people who have been ground down for generations that they should not enjoy the rights and opportunities this country has been given over 30 years. We do not have that right morally because if it existed, the Germans and the French would have been quite entitled to have told us in 1972 to take a hike and we would never have reached the level of prosperity we have today.</p>

Whether it is correct or not, I recognise a contemporary and former colleague from the Permanent Representation in Brussels behind the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The Labour Party should be complimented on the very constructive role it has played since the defeat of the Nice treaty referendum in the Forum, in the debate on this Bill and in helping us get round the neutrality problem. I also pay tribute to the work of the Forum, which I hope will be ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">I agree with Senator Dardis. One is not really talking about a democratic deficit as it is ordinarily understood. The issues are complex and have effects on the ground; they filter down and sometimes people think they have a <i>fait accompli</i>. Broadly, people are happy the Council of Ministers takes decisions but there is a difference between representative Government and direct democracy. Part of the problem is that we confront people with complex issues because we have to have a referendum on every treaty. As has been said, the problem is an information surfeit, not an information deficit, where one must sift through vast amounts of material. I hope the Bill will help distil issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">I agree that the EU is very open and if one is prepared to take the time one can find out what is going on nearly all the time. The European Council negotiations last night in Berlin are not going to be carried out in front of television cameras – no negotiation in the world could be done like that – but subject to that caveat the EU is virtually the most transparent organisation that exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">For better or worse, as a result of the referendum defeat we have people's attention on European issues in a way we have not had for a long time – probably since soon after we entered Europe. We need to keep people's attention, or otherwise the gap between perceptions and fears, which can be fanned easily and dangerously, could cause us great difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">I agree entirely with Senator Dardis that except for the most compelling and pressing reason, which does not exist in this case, we have no right as a nation of 4 million people – or even if we were much larger – to veto the wishes of all the other countries. The proper role for us to play in our interests and views is in the course of negotiations. I agree with the Minister's point, which I heard him make last night also. People talk in the most negative fashion about parties exercising a veto in the Northern context, yet in the European context the veto is the most democratic option around. There is an inconsistency there.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">I hope and believe this referendum will be passed because we all recognise that other countries should have the same chance that we were given 30 years ago. Unlike Denmark, we have done very well by being at the heart of the European Union. If we continue to show commitment to Europe, it will continue to show commitment to us.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Rourke:</from>
          <p eId="para_211">I thank Senator Dardis for sharing his time with Senator Mansergh and me. I congratulate the Labour Party for introducing a Bill which was long overdue and which has been accepted and amended by the Government side. It was initiated imaginatively by the Labour Party which I acknowledge. It is an excellent Bill. I agree with Senator Hayes that it is evolutionary, one which will not set in stone how the scrutiny committee should conduct its business. Clearly, this will emerge as the committee finds its feet. I hope our enthusiasm will not be tempered by the exigencies of the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">We also hope the Treaty of Nice will be passed and are determined to show citizens that a democratic deficit is not the way we intend to do business. The same can be said for Europe. I hope everybody will not just heave a sigh of relief when the treaty has been passed and then say that is the end of it. The committee will have very important work to do. That work will be back-breaking and endless and, in many cases, dull and repetitive. It will be exciting, however, if we believe it is for the benefit of the people, but much will depend on whoever sits on the committee. Will its members falter, attend when required, filter out what is important with regard to directives and legislation or just take the easy way out?</p>
          <p eId="para_213">As a Minister I spent years travelling to Brussels. One is given a script to read on the plane journey and told that that is the line COREPER has adopted. That is how it happens. In the main, they are wonderful civil servants who are intellectually gifted and demonstrate great commitment to Europe. It is not good enough, however, that Members of the Oireachtas do not have an input into such matters before they are included in a directive. I am tired of seeing directives which have not come into being through the democratic process. The Council of Ministers is not open to the public, no matter how much we talk about democracy and the openness of the European parliamentary system. The Council of Ministers is a closed shop with a sign saying, Talking – Do Not Disturb. The talking is done by Ministers, mostly from a brief. People here are not aware that such important directives affecting their daily lives will be passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The work will be back-breaking and we will not all be suddenly enthused with European affairs. I agree with Senator Dardis that this Chamber should be a fulcrum for all matters European, be it receiving so-called important persons from Europe or the intense scrutiny of directives. Some Members complain about the discussion of issues such as turbary rights and special areas of conservation. I agree that we must look at the bigger picture – Europe – and study European integration. We must be generous to those who wish to come and have their say.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">We can learn from other legislatures. The bicameral system has operated very well in the United Kingdom. Senator Hayes and I recently and separately met the Leader of the House of Lords. The systems operating in Finland, Denmark and Germany give a special role to the Upper Houses regarding the scrutiny and exposition of policies. Ministers come to the Upper Houses before travelling onwards in Europe where they can be swamped by COREPER. It is important to have transparent scrutiny of all these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">It is not a matter of reviewing issues once they have been included in directives – that is like bolting the door when the horse has gone. Reviews must be undertaken before issues are included in secondary legislation or Ministers travel onwards in Europe where they can be swamped by the bureaucracy. If we are all part of the European project, we must work like demons on this scrutiny committee and ensure this Chamber is utilised much more thoughtfully and in an investigative manner to deal with many of the matters which come before the Oireachtas. I propose that this House be used in a fuller and more comprehensive manner under the guidance of the Cathaoirleach. We should examine European affairs in this House as well as at the committee. I endorse the Bill and the amendments proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The Nice treaty referendum is uppermost in our minds. I wonder what has happened to the Irish traits of fáilte and flaithiúlacht, with which we like to think we are endowed. Now is the time for us to extend the hand of generosity and friendship. This Bill will be part of the parameters of a much more open dialogue about European matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">We have now reached the end of the period given to us to carry the message of the Nice treaty to every household, pub, restaurant and shop in our constituencies. When the House met for the first time three weeks ago, we debated the treaty at length. As we endorse and embrace the European Union (Scrutiny) Bill, we should revisit some of the salient points. We must reiterate the benefits which the European project has given to us in the past and which will continue in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">It is regrettable that in recent days and weeks some elements in the "No" campaign have proved once again to be manifestly ignorant and arrogant in the discharge of sections of the "No" campaign. They have attempted to bully and to misinform the public. They have attempted to take the Nice treaty and discuss everything else bar the one central issue – the enlargement of the European Union. They have spoken about the rapid reaction force and misinterpreted parts of the Amsterdam treaty. They have spoken about streamlining democracy, about a conglomerate political grouping in Europe not accountable to states or the European Union in its totality. I hope the people will prove them wrong on Saturday. The people concerned have been responsible for the worst campaign I have experienced in my adult life.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">The economy has grown by becoming part of a union which has helped us to strengthen and develop it to a point which we used to think was impossible. Due to the efforts of successive Administrations we have, by and large, peace in the Six Counties. The Nice treaty is about ensuring the right to peace will be extended to the eastern European countries which have applied to become members of the European Union. The leaders, prior to the collapse of the Berlin Wall, of the dictatorships, those responsible for genocide, the Communists, the people who attempted to subvert democracy at every stage, who wanted to see democracy pushed to the end of the agenda and who wanted to behave in a manner abhorrent to any form of civilised democracy in the western world, would be only too delighted if this country again rejected the treaty on Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Elements of the "No" campaign, which claim to be part of the left, to be socialists or to be representative of the working class, are arrogant and intentional in their <i>modus operandi</i> of preventing workers here from benefiting from European Union directives which this country would not have were it not for the European Parliament. People who purport to represent workers are asking them to vote against a treaty which copperfastens their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">This Bill will bring the workings of the European Union closer to this country and will result in greater scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas of European Union legislation, directives and everything else which emanates from there. I wonder if the likes of Deputy Joe Higgins, members of Sinn Féin and members of the Green Party, whose Deputies in the other House I class as reasonably intelligent, would take time out of their busy schedules to look at the directives Brussels has introduced for workers. These include the equal pay and equal treatment directives, the directives on collective redundancies and transfer of undertakings, which obliges employers to consult employee representatives when redundancies are transferred to another employer or are being considered, the directive guaranteeing the rights of workers if their employer becomes insolvent, the directive obliging employers to issue workers with a written contract of employment, the extremely wide-ranging health and safety directives, the maternity and parental leave directives and the directives guaranteeing equal pay and treatment to part-time and temporary workers, soon to be joined by a directive on workers who are employed through agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The European social partners, trade unions and employers, have just concluded a European Union wide agreement guaranteeing the rights of teleworkers, postal workers and the rights of workers sent to other countries. The working time directive guarantees, among other things, the right to four weeks' annual holidays. Deputy Joe Higgins, Sinn Féin and the Green Party, who purport to represent the working class, are asking the citizens of our sovereign republic to vote against those directives next Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">It is a pleasure to be involved in an elected Assembly where there is all-party consensus on the issue of bringing poorer, underdeveloped countries into the larger European Union. This treaty, in so far as it can, allows for the workings of the parliament to change to facilitate that enlargement. It is a pity that some people who have received democratic mandates have used every red herring in the political arena in recent weeks. Deputy Healy of Clonmel, who advised people to vote against this treaty because they already voted on it last year, stood at least four, if not five, times for election to Dáil Éireann before he was elected. If he wanted to take a leaf out of his own book, surely he would not have stood for election again when his constituents rejected his membership of Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I hope that on Saturday those people will allow poor countries, poor farmers and workers and women in the Czech Republic, Poland, Latvia and Slovenia to have the same opportunities we received. I hope the democratic citizens of this country will show the people in the "No" brigade that this is a democracy which is willing to extend the democratic arm to our counterparts in eastern Europe.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy:</from>
          <p eId="para_228">I welcome the Bill and thank the other parties for their acceptance of it. I, too, commend the work of the Forum on Europe, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, on its work in bringing the debate on the future of Europe around the country. This has been a positive departure and is something on which we should build in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">This Bill is also important from the point of view of engaging the people in EU affairs and ensuring openness and accountability in debate. I hope it will bring more media coverage of European affairs because at present it does not get the coverage it deserves. That would help involve the people in European affairs and help them to realise the positive work being done by the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I agree that more than this Bill is needed to redress the issue of the democratic deficit but it is a good start. It is important the Bill's secrecy provisions are not used to avoid its intention and perhaps we should revisit those provisions in the future to see how they can be improved. The fact that EU regulations allow Ministers to amend Acts of the Oireachtas needs to be considered to ensure that is also more accountable.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_83">
          <from>Dr. Henry:</from>
          <p eId="para_232">I welcome the Labour Party's imaginative effort in bringing this Bill forward and congratulate the Government parties on accepting it. I have little patience with people who complain about the European Union being run by bureaucrats. It is our own fault if that happens. We are the representatives of the people and if we make no effort to take ownership of the process, it is our own fault. I have a great deal of sympathy for those who, all too frequently, have had to represent politicians when they might have preferred that the politicians represented themselves. I have had the good fortune to be on various committees representing Ireland in Brussels and Strasbourg and I got nothing but help with any of the briefs I needed to prepare. Anyone who accompanied me never tried to direct what I should do and they were always supportive of what I felt was the will of the people I represented.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The initiation of the Forum on Europe was a splendid achievement on the part of the last Government and I was glad to be a member of the forum. This Bill reminds me of the committee the Danes have which considers European legislation. I think Senator Ormonde was in attendance on the same day as I when the Danish representatives gave us an outline of how they look at legislation. I hope we try to emulate that as much as possible. It was not a good idea to tag European legislation on to the end of committees because it was left to one side to be dealt with in Europe by MEPs. National parliaments should take notice of what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">This Bill has resulted in us straying into the Nice debate and why would we not as it is incredibly important? It is not only incredibly important for us, but also for the European Union and the applicant countries. I was an enthusiastic "Yes" voter last year and I am again this year, but I understand why so many people did not go out to vote and why so many voted "No". Not enough effort was made to explain the treaty and its importance and I suppose we are all to blame for that. I did not do half as much as I should have done but, this time, I hope I have done enough to persuade those with whom I have been in contact to vote "Yes".</p>
          <p eId="para_235">To those who say the Amsterdam treaty allows the applicant countries to join, I ask, if we vote "No" and only five countries may join, who will choose which countries join? What discord will we have introduced in the applicant countries if we insist that they must join under the Amsterdam treaty? I certainly would not like to be part of the process deciding which countries may join.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I visit the applicant countries relatively often. I have been to the Baltic countries, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic and I know the huge efforts they have made to try to fulfil the tasks given to them so that they would be eligible for membership. They have done so at great personal expense in some cases. It is important to remember the words last week of the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, who, to paraphrase, said that some of the Governments that have brought forward these changes now have a hard time in holding the line, even in holding the line on democracy in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I would urge anyone with a vote to vote in favour of this treaty. It is the people of the candidate countries who matter; it is people we are talking about bringing into the European Union, not just states. It brings to mind the words of Yeats in that marvellous poem we all read in school, <i>Easter 1916: </i>“Too long a sacrifice can make stone of the heart.” These countries have had five grim decades of making sacrifices. They have made sacrifices of another sort in order to gain membership of the EU, and let us not disappoint them now.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">When they say they want to join, who are we to say this is not a good decision for them? Let us welcome them with open arms and let us hope that they prosper and do as well as we have. The benefits of enlargement are much greater for Ireland than any disadvantages there may be.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden:</from>
          <p eId="para_241">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, to the House and wish him every success on 19 October. I compliment him on an excellent campaign so far, although it is a case of a lot done, more to do until Saturday, 19 October. In fairness to the Government, and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, in particular, he identified flaws amongst the campaigners on the opposite side of the debate. I said to him at one stage that perhaps he should not emphasise too much the calibre of those opposing the treaty. However, the Minister proceeded anyway and he has been vindicated, in particular by the revelations on the "Late Late Show" about some of those who seem to be constantly advocating a "No" position in relation to Europe without offering an alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">I am delighted this Bill is before the House because it addresses some of the concerns expressed by many people. I served under Des O'Malley as Minister of State in the Department of Industry in Commerce from 1989 to 1992, and had responsibility for all foreign trade. I was also involved in negotiating the Single European Act. On many occasions we flew to Brussels and had a briefing on the evening before going to a particular EU meeting, but we did not have the benefit of the views of either House of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Many complicated issues arose, and on at least one occasion the advisers from the Department were putting one view and the permanent representative was putting another, leaving me to arbitrate between both views in the national interest. That is the responsibility of Ministers, but it would be very beneficial for Ministers to have the benefit of the collective wisdom of both Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly in relation to important legislation that is being dealt with by the Council of Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I regard my attendance at the Council of Ministers as one of the greatest privileges of my political life, and there a few people in this Chamber who have also been in that position. What you see there is the parity of esteem that exists between the larger and the smaller countries; the size of the country or its percentage of the vote does not arise as a factor. All states are there as equal partners, whether it is the Germans, the French, the British or anybody else. When an issue arose, we would often receive support from a variety of countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">At the time I was involved in negotiating the Single European Act, I constantly succeeded in obtaining derogations. I proposed that Ireland have a seven-year derogation in relation to insurance and health insurance as we wanted to strengthen and secure the position of the VHI before it faced competition from BUPA, which has now entered our market, and rightly so. We were concerned about the fragile state of the Irish insurance market and worried that if we flooded the country with competition, we might damage our own interests. Every time an issue affecting our interests arose, I received on behalf of this country the support of the other countries around the negotiating table. I cannot recall one instance in which our national interests were not protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">We had a great team of representatives in Brussels, and we still have one of the best qualified, most professional teams representing any country in Europe. It was a policy of successive Governments to provide funding and support for the major infrastructural offices in Brussels, and it is a good investment that has brought us enormous benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I hope that the scrutiny committee, when it is formed, will have the input of people with knowledge and experience of the European situation, but there is also a strong case for televising parts or all of the deliberations of the Council of Ministers. There is a case also for televising some of the deliberations of the Commission to demonstrate the parity of esteem that exists between member states. There is a need to make people more aware of what is happening in Europe. There is an enormous amount of coverage of European affairs at the moment and we are hearing from our MEPs, but in general there is very little.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">It was a very positive step last week to have President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, speak before this House. When the present debate is over and the Nice treaty is hopefully ratified and Europe expanded, we must try in every way we can to make EU affairs more meaningful to ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">We have a particularly important decision to make on Saturday because we represent all of Ireland in this case. Our fellow Irishmen and women in Northern Ireland do not have a say in whether we sign the Nice treaty or not. The British Government, which represents the interests of Northern Ireland at this point in time, has already ratified the treaty. We have to represent the interests of the whole of Ireland, and all of Ireland will be well served by a "Yes" vote on Saturday. We have this privilege because of our 1937 Constitution, which offers certain safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">It is a marvellous honour to have the opportunity of this very detailed debate that has taken place over the last few months. Perhaps we ought to be grateful to those who voted "No" in 2001. The eyes of 340 million people across Europe are focused upon Ireland. Let there be no doubt that there is no safety net in the event of another "No" vote. It would be a case of going back to the drawing board. All kinds of statements can be made and arguments concocted, but the reality in law is that the Nice treaty has to be agreed by all 15 member states. We cannot agree to the Nice treaty unless the Irish people vote "Yes" next Saturday. Propaganda has been put out in the last week to the effect that there is no point in voting "Yes", that enlargement will go ahead anyway, but it certainly will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">A "Yes" vote on Saturday would be a wonderful céad míle fáilte to the ten applicant countries, which comprise over 100 million people. On Monday, the trade body Enterprise Ireland should take out full-page advertisements in all the national newspapers in all the applicant countries saying "Céad míle fáilte, one hundred thousand welcomes to one hundred million people." The Irish people will hopefully have spoken decisively at that stage. I would not like to book advertisements in advance, but I think we can anticipate a good result because it is in the national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The increase in trade to the applicant countries has been outstanding over the past few years, and this will continue. Ireland voted very decisively in favour of the Single European Act. There were various concerns and we discussed all the details of that particular Act. It was not a doomsday situation. Issues such as trade difficulties, privatisation of the ESB, privatisation of postal services and so on were teased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The Single European Act was a great success for this country. We were fond of the derogations – perhaps too much so. We actually relented on some of the derogations we received but generally speaking we got a tremendous deal in Europe so far as the Single European Act was concerned. The interests of all Departments were well catered for by our excellent negotiating team.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">We have to look ahead. The European Union (Scrutiny) Bill is welcome. If it were possible to provide a schedule of all proposed legislation coming before the European Union in advance of the accession of the ten candidate countries, such as that provided in the past week by the Whip of all the Bills before the Houses, those proposed and those at drafting stage, it would be a useful exercise. The proposed committee should be established forthwith and provided with proper backup and support services and a time slot that accommodates most Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Given the number of committees to be established, Senators, and particularly Deputies, if appointed to one or more committees, will have little time to engage in constituency work. I have been out of here for some time but when I was a Member previously there were very few committees. There was the Committee of Public Accounts, the Small Businesses Committee, of which the former Deputy, Mr. Ivan Yates, was chairman, and I was a member, and a few others. Perhaps there are now too many committees. I sympathise with Members of both Houses, who will have great difficulty, as we have today, in trying to cope with the number of demands on them. Members of this House want to be Members of the other House and Members of the other House may be lucky to be in this House at some stage in the future. I wonder how the Minister of State who has been busy campaigning in his constituency and was effective on the radio today – even "Coronation Street" did not interrupt his work – can cope with his workload and come into the House for as long as is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I commend the Bill to the House. It will be of enormous assistance to the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and all Ministers and colleagues in Government going to Europe. It will also assist members of the European Parliament in their work on behalf of this country.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Mr. Daly:</from>
          <p eId="para_257">I thank Senator Leyden for affording me the opportunity to make a brief contribution. I do not wish unduly to delay the legislation, which meets some of the criticism levelled at the Houses in recent years that we have been behind time and out of step with what is taking place in Europe. The debates here have mainly followed matters decided two to five years previously by the Commission and the Council of Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I have some anxieties which perhaps the Minister of State can take on board. A half yearly report from each Department will amount to 28 reports annually and could lead to unnecessary overlapping and duplication and confusion. That is not necessary. Instead we need to simplify matters rather than confuse them. In regard to legislation there will be an overall report at the end of the year from Government. Let us not throw out the baby with the bath water. In an effort to deal with the criticisms of not keeping pace with the legislation, matters could be more confused by 28 reports and an overall report and at end of the day little discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">When we joined the European Union there was a committee on the secondary legislation of the European Communities that dealt with legislation emanating from Brussels in a focused and direct way. That committee was superseded by the foreign affairs and European affairs committees. To the best of my knowledge the European affairs committee had a select committee that dealt with legislation. The committee on the secondary legislation of the European Communities was a more focused and direct way of doing business and if Members were not happy to raise issues in the House, they had the opportunity to do so on the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">While the European Affairs Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee are effective they have to deal with the day to day issues in their areas. For example, the Foreign Affairs Committee would be discussing today the atrocities in Bali rather than legislation emanating from Europe. Perhaps it is opportune to consider the possibility of setting up a select committee or a sub-committee to deal specifically and exclusively with European legislation. That would be superior to various reports from Departments culminating in further confusion rather than simplifying matters for the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The legislation is welcome so far as it goes. However, other initiatives will be necessary and it is important that they are not lost sight of. The legislation is coming at an opportune time because it affords us the opportunity to discuss the vote on Saturday. It is critical for those interested in European and in Irish affairs that the people come out and vote on Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">As a member of the Council of Europe prior to your appointment, a Chathaoirligh, you would have been fully aware of the concerns of the ten applicant countries, who are anxious to join the European Union, for a strong "Yes" vote on Saturday in favour of enlargement. I was approached by several applicant countries at the last meeting in Strasbourg to encourage the people to vote "Yes" because of its importance to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I cannot understand why members of the European Parliament such as Patricia McKenna and Dana Rosemary Scallon have campaigned strongly for a "No" vote. They are prepared to draw their salaries and expenses from Europe, yet they want to ridicule Europe at the first opportunity. Equally I cannot understand the Green Party because it talks about rectifying some democratic deficit. Is the Green Party suggesting that 105 million people who suffered the tyranny and oppression of communism for so long would be prepared to be drawn into some other anti-democratic tyrannical organisation? They would point out that they are getting involved in the European Union because they see it as the vehicle which can underpin the democratic systems which have developed in the member states formerly under communism. They see membership of the Union as of paramount importance in ensuring the democratic system which they strove to attain and for which many died. Has the Green Party forgotten about the communist tanks in Hungary when it suggests that 105 million who wish to join the European Union would in some way forfeit what they have suffered and died for in the past to establish democratic systems by joining an undemocratic organisation which does not meet some ideas which apparently are dear to some of members of the Green Party?</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Last Saturday we saw the type of tyranny we can expect from people like the leader of the Socialist Party who condoned the breaking down of the perimeter fences around Shannon Airport. He tried to cause havoc in Shannon, which could have put people's lives in danger. That was a demonstration of the kind of blackguardism we see advocated by those people, who felt a little intimidated at the time because there was a camera focused on them. That must have been the first time Deputy Higgins's party was embarrassed about cameras; he is usually looking for publicity to advocate its cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The legislation before the House is very important because it is a further indication of our willingness to be part of the European ideal. I take this opportunity to appeal to people in my own constituency, who have benefited from Europe, to see Europe's enlargement as a positive and forward looking step and to come out to vote on Saturday and give a resounding "Yes" to enlargement of the European Union.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke:</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I welcome this timely Bill. Had it or similar legislation been implemented years ago, we would not have the difficulties we currently face with regard to some European directives that have been implemented over the years. I refer specifically to the habitats directive. When it was being implemented, few of our own or the European civil servants were fully conscious of the adverse effects of the directive on the livelihoods of many people, particularly in areas in the west which were most sensitive to its impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">As a former member of an Oireachtas European affairs committee, I had the opportunity to represent interest groups whose members were concerned about the serious impact of the directive on their livelihoods. A representative of the Commissioner, Julian Bruno, appeared before the committee. In response to the concern expressed by members, he stated that it was never intended that a directive of the European Commission would impact in any way on the capacity of people in Ireland to earn a living. That was important but, unfortunately, that is not the case. Will the Minister of State tell us if it is possible to amend, withdraw or appeal some aspects of these directives which have a serious impact on the livelihoods of people in certain areas of this country?</p>
          <p eId="para_270">In regard to other ministerial orders and directives from the Department of Agriculture and Food – some of which were pioneered by the Minister of State in another capacity – many farmers were severely penalised in respect of the implementation of various schemes in that a simple human error was classified in the Department of Agriculture and Food as being the work of a person who had intended to commit fraud. That simple human error was counted as fraudulent in the administration of schemes throughout Europe, which is a tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The Minister of State will be aware that there are people in the Department of Agriculture and Food who interpreted schemes in a very narrow way and made it difficult for people to abide by the rules and regulations because of the amount of paperwork involved. That was never the intention but that is the situation in which we find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Among the many "No" lobby groups, there is a legitimate group of people who are angry with Europe for no reason other than they have been penalised unfairly, and that group will manifest itself in a "No" vote on Saturday. That is a tragedy but it is the unfortunate reality. The other people involved in the "No" lobby are entitled to their opinions, but an additional group believe they have no choice but to vote "No" because they have been penalised unjustly by our own Department of Agriculture and Food officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">I regret having to raise this matter. When I raised it as a Member of the other House, I was asked by a group of civil servants to withdraw my statement and apologise publicly to them. I reiterate here that I have no intention of doing that because I believe I am right in what I am saying, namely, that many wrongs have been done to many ordinary people who have been denied a substantial amount of their income because of the failure in the transfer of European funds which would have supplemented their income. That problem has to be rectified and I hope in his reply the Minister of State will indicate that some mechanism will be put in place, if it does not already exist, whereby people with a grievance such as this can appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">These Houses have failed over the years to tackle this injustice. It is easy to blame the then Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, for implementing the directive but we are talking about simple issues like denying someone the right to cut turf in the bogs, which is an annual event for many people. The then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, had to take the brunt of the criticism but unfortunately she did not take it upon herself to rectify the problem other than by obtaining a derogation for ten years, the end of which is fast approaching.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">I hope this legislation might open the door to resolving this problem, which may encourage people to vote "No" on Saturday. I would regret that very much.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_91">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes:</from>
          <p eId="para_276">I will not detain the House because I understand the need to expedite this legislation but I want to make a number of points. I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, back with us again to discuss this legislation which has the potential, if we get it right, to be important for two reasons. First, it connects us with the decision-making process in Europe which, sadly, has been missing for many years and, second, it connects the public also with the decision-making process in Brussels. If we get this right, we will have done a very good day's work in terms of implementing this legislation to ensure there is proper scrutiny of all the decisions that come out of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">For too long we have blamed the European Union for problems that are of our own making. It is easy to blame the foreigner or people we do not meet on a daily basis. When decisions go wrong for Ireland, we frequently blame nameless bureaucrats or a commission. The hapless Commissioner ends up on a Sunday radio programme trying to defend the decision. However, Ministers – of all Governments – frequently go to Brussels and come back with a very good result. The Minister then beats his chest and claims that this was a result of his intervention. The truth of the matter is that many officials of many countries come together to arrive at a good result for our country. By having this legislation in place and ensuring that the decision-making process is properly scrutinised we will arrive at a better decision for all concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I understand that the Minister would like to reply and I welcome that. I agree totally with Senator Daly's remarks about the report mechanism in this legislation. Far too many reports from Government Departments are not read. The Minister, as a former chairman of the SMI committee, knows this as we made this comment continually. We are sick of reports which are never read by the public or by politicians and take up a huge amount of money and time for civil servants. This is something that needs to be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">When a decision comes before the Houses of the Oireachtas, it is a matter for each House to determine which committee looks at it. It would be wrong for the Committee on European Affairs to have absolute power to decide which committee investigates the decision-making process with the Minister. It should be placed here on the Order of Business and it should then go automatically to the committees, not necessarily to the Committee on European Affairs. It should be in the power of each House to devolve to the relevant committee each article or decision that comes before it.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Section 2(3) of the Bill provides that there is no need for the committees to consider this area of policy if there is a lack of time. The time problem, however, is determined by the Minister. This subsection could be grossly abused and I would like the Minister to clarify in his reply that this will not occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">In relation to section 3, the Constitution states clearly that both Houses of the Oireachtas must meet in public session but the committees of both Houses have the power to meet in private. There is the potential for private meetings to take place between the Members and the Minister involved. I understand why that might happen, but this should be the exception rather than the rule. It is important that a private meeting is the last procedure before the Minister and committee scrutinise the decision. It would be wrong for us to allow private meetings to become normal practice in the Houses because that would disengage the public from the process. If we are to be successful with this we need publicity and also a change of heart, not just from the Members but from the media, which should devote more resources to covering the proceedings of both Houses as well as the committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">This legislation has the potential to revolutionise Parliament in terms of the decision-making process in Brussels and within the Houses. I congratulate the Labour Party on an excellent initiative and I hope the Government continues to accept Private Members' Bills such as this to ensure that everyone, not just the Executive, can make a contribution. Our system, dominated by the Executive, is a bad one because it ensures that whole sections of parliamentarians are excluded from the work of Parliament. That is bad for democracy.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell:</from>
          <p eId="para_283">I will not detain the House because we want to process all Stages quickly. A point which came through in the Second Stage discussion was that there is some concern about the system being worked in good faith by the Government and that the resources should be made available to the relevant committees. The Government will have to pay heed to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">I mentioned during my earlier contribution that while on the sub-committee on secondary EU legislation some years ago I was struck by the huge volume of paperwork relating to EU legislation. The Minister referred to this in his speech. There is not the remotest doubt that unless additional facilities are provided to committees to sift through the draft legislation, to summarise it and to provide secretarial and other support to Members who want to get seriously involved, this legislation simply will not work and will remain no more than a pious aspiration.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Minister will contribute on the later Stages of the Bill. The message from this House will be that the legislation is fine and we accept the Government's assurances at face value, but we need to see a serious commitment in terms of resources to ensure that the Bill can be turned into reality. Beyond that, there has been universal acclaim for the Bill and its contents and we have had a very useful Second Stage. I assume we can pass the remaining Stages of the Bill rapidly this evening.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes:</from>
          <p eId="para_288">To whom do I direct the question? Maybe the bureaucrats. Subsection (3) allows the Minister to opt out of bringing an opinion to the committee due to lack of time. It seems a useful provision. If something comes up quickly the Government must always respond, although it may not be possible to bring a committee of the House together. There does not, however, seem to be any time limit on this. This subsection could be open to abuse if a Minister was not prepared to work with a committee. Does the Minister, or Senator McDowell as the proposer of the Bill, have any idea about time limits? This is an important provision but it is also important that it is not abused.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Mr. McDowell:</from>
          <p eId="para_289">This issue was discussed on Committee Stage when the Bill passed through the Dáil. If there is sufficient time for an explanation as to why there is not sufficient time, then there is sufficient time to do the job. Fine Gael proposed an amendment suggesting that an explanation be given as to why there was not enough time. Clearly, that is not practical.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">I take some solace, however, in the phrase used by the Minister for Foreign Affairs today when he said that section 3 was intended to provide for exceptional circumstances. He was referring to confidentiality, but it is important that we emphasise that both the confidentiality and urgency opt-outs should only be used in exceptional circumstances. There is no specific time limit in the Bill and I am not sure whether one would be helpful.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">Senator Hayes mentioned time limits. Clearly, exceptional circumstances can arise and it would be a breach of faith if the Government were to abuse this. There is no doubt that the committee would be very vocal in its criticism if that were to happen. There will still be a requirement that the Government explain exactly what happened, including the circumstances and time constraints which forced an action. I do not think this could be abused, certainly not easily. It would be very unwise for a Government to do so.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes:</from>
          <p eId="para_292">I have another objection to the rule whereby the committee can meet in private for reasons of confidentiality. As I said in my contribution, there is no constitutional bar on a committee of the House meeting in private, although there is a bar on a plenary session of the Dáil or Seanad in private. Section 3 states:</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Subsections (1) and (2) of section 2 shall not apply to a proposed measure which, in the opinion of the Minister, is confidential.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Has consideration been given to a joint decision of the Minister and the committee, which would give greater validity to the private session that would ultimately occur? I know this will be an exception to the rule, but if the decision was taken jointly by the Minister and the committee, would this safeguard the procedure? Once a private meeting occurs those who are against the European Union will use this as an opportunity to attack Members of the House and say this is an example of meeting behind closed doors without any legitimacy.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_99">
          <from>Mr. McDowell:</from>
          <p eId="para_295">This is something about which I have been concerned. I would prefer a straightforward objective test rather than this subjective test. In other words, if something is confidential the requirement under the process should not necessarily apply, but obviously we will leave the test as to whether a matter is confidential exclusively to the opinion of the Minister. It does not have to be a justified opinion, it just has to be his or her opinion. This places a serious onus on the Minister to discharge that judgment in a reasonable fashion. Good faith is the key issue here.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Clearly if Ministers abuse this provision the section will not work. The section contains the possibility that one could abuse it because all one would have to do is say that in their opinion it is confidential and that is the end of the issue. There is no requirement to demonstrate that something is objectively confidential. It should be put on record that it is possible this section will prove to be inadequate and it comes down entirely to the good faith of Ministers. For the moment I am prepared to trust that good faith exists.</p>

        <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_100" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. Roche:</from>
          <p eId="para_297">This is a thorny issue which has arisen because of the wide nature of the measure which is universal. The Government is committed to an open and transparent system of the Oireachtas and it would be a very foolish Government that would try to roll back the decisions we all made in recent years to be more open. Section 3(2) makes it clear that the Minister may make a report to either or both Houses of the Oireachtas or to a committee of either or both Houses in relation to the proposed measure as he or she deems appropriate in the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The provision on confidentiality is necessary because of the wide remit of the Bill which covers literally everything. It embraces all three pillars, including proposals by member states under the second and third tiers. This could deal with issues such as the Justice and Home Affairs area, which it may not be a good idea to discuss or even, for example, the controversial issue of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. If, for example, there was a proposal to impose sanctions such as those imposed against the regime of the former Yugoslav President Milosevic, it might not be of benefit to discuss such matters at a very early stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The idea of dealing with confidential issues is a necessary inclusion but it is clearly something that should be used as an exception. There are precedents for this in other legislation, including in the Ombudsman and Freedom of Information legislation. There is an arrangement whereby we accept Ministers will not abuse such a position. They would be very foolish to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">There were discussions with Fine Gael on this matter in the other House. The issue is to provide for confidentiality in very exceptional circumstances where a matter arises the sensitivity of which is such that it could not be discussed in open session.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#DickRoche" eId="spk_102" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. Roche:</from>
          <p eId="para_302">Obviously we would have to see how this provision would work. If the Deputy is talking about targeting some activity from the point of view of sanctions, it would clearly destroy the entire purpose of sanctions if there was to be a wide and open discussion about them. I assume a Minister would brief the chairman. I believe the arrangement that works best in these cases is where Ministers deal as directly as they possibly can with the chair and the committee members. This is the only way the system can work. If one were to take the alternative route and include exclusions in the Bill, one would undermine the entire purpose of the legislation. The benefit of the Bill as drafted is that it is universal in its cover and there has not been an effort either by the promoting party or by Government in responding to it to include all the caveats and exclusions that are fairly typical.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The idea is to make it as open as possible but there is also a fairly obvious and practical requirement that one must protect those occasions, which in my view will be rare, where confidentiality arising from the circumstance will necessitate something other than a full and open discussion. It would have to be transparently obvious to the committee that this was not an abuse by the Government of the day. It would be a very foolish Government or Minister that would try to duck behind the confidentiality requirement. For example, in the Ombudsman's Act there is a provision whereby Ministers may not make certain information available but this has never been used. I argued in this House that it was likely never to be used and I would guarantee it will probably never be used. Nonetheless, given the nature and extraordinary breadth of issues covered it is necessary to include this provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">It is not to give Ministers a bolthole in which to hide; it is to ensure the Oireachtas and the committee which represents the Oireachtas will have the widest possible operation. When on the very rare occasions confidentiality is called for, a Minister would make a report in good faith and the committee would ultimately have to make a judgment on the issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell:</from>
          <p eId="para_305">We should not cod ourselves. While I accept the Minister of State's good faith in the issue, there are Departments of State – the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the most obvious one – which regard almost <i>ipso facto</i> everything they do as confidential. Some colleagues in that Department have to be pushed and shoved into briefing anyone as to the nature of what they do. There will be a need for proactive action from Government in this regard. We do not want the Justice and Home Affairs pillar of the European Union closed down because the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regards these matters as confidential.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">I endorse Senator Hayes's point on the facility whereby committees can meet in private. I have been on the finance committee for the past five years and it is not unusual for relatively confidential information to be confided to members of the committee in private session. No doubt Government Ministers could make use of that provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">On the issue of measures, as the Minister of State knows in regard to the establishment of EU directives, under the freedom of information any citizen of the European Union can find out exactly the discussions that take place between the Commission, a representative group or the Government. However, that is not the case in this jurisdiction. Under the Freedom of Information Act, I am not entitled to know exactly the position of one Department as against another before the Bill is actually published.

          <p eId="para_310">My view is well known on issues such as freedom of information. Senator Brian Hayes knows my views and I have also taken the view that the best way to make sure secrets are not leaked is to have absolutely no secrets at all. This issue was discussed in this House when we debated the Freedom of Information Act. I was sitting on the other side of the House and arguing about these issues. Opinions, materials and drafts went backwards and forwards between Departments at the very early advanced stages. The argument was made – one which certainly has validity – that the prior opinions of Departments that went into the formative stage are not an issue in any jurisdiction or subject to freedom of information because what becomes a matter of freedom of information is the stage when the legislation is consolidated and comes forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">I have always taken the view privately that it would be very illuminating to know what discussions went on in the background in the formulation stage. I would not be prepared to give a commitment in that respect here, but I have private views that might not be a million miles from those of Senator Brian Hayes.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">Many of the provisions in the Bill have already been in operation on an informal basis since 1 July. The additional obligations arising from the Bill will be addressed and implemented by all Departments as quickly as possible, and there is an anxiety that that be the case. The House can be assured of good will in that matter and of the bona fides of the Government, myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We have already appeared before the committee on a number of occasions. The committee is under way and is doing extremely good work.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Senator Brian Hayes made a valid point in his final contribution that democracy can only thrive if it is open and people see it working. People cannot see the extremely good work being done by the committee if the media do not have the resources to cover it. It is not a fault of the reporting staff of these Houses, but a fault of those who decide to assign pages in the national papers and time on our national broadcasting station. It is an astonishing fact that the committee has been doing extremely good work which is being largely ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The adoption of this Bill demonstrates strongly the Government's ongoing commitment to increasing the level of public and parliamentary debate on EU matters. Since the last referendum on the Nice treaty, the Government has endeavoured to engage in the process of public dialogue on the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">This new legislation will serve to allay fears expressed by some at the National Forum on Europe that the EU legislative process is not sufficiently transparent or accountable. That fear exists, but in this State, as a result of this legislation, people can be aware that the process of making the whole venture more transparent is now well under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The adoption of the Bill will result in continual dialogue and exchanges of opinion between Members of the Oireachtas and the Government on a wide range of legislation that directly impacts on all our lives. The new Act will ensure that the Oireachtas is informed about proposed legislation and will offer Members the opportunity to express their views and continue to shape Government policy while legislation is being negotiated.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Senator Ulick Burke made a very interesting observation. Both Senator Brian Hayes and I smiled as he was doing so because we are aware of the contribution that he made in terms of farmers and their difficulties arising from EU legislation. We found out that the difficulties arose in Ireland and were not the fault of Brussels. The type of scrutiny being introduced in this Bill will make our Departments and Ministers much more aware of any pitfalls that might arise. This is very positive legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The system of oral briefings by Ministers, while not provided for in the legislation, is an integral part of the scrutiny system and will further promote dialogue between Members of the Oireachtas and the Government, facilitating the exchange of ideas, concerns and opinions. The last briefing that took place before the last general affairs Council meeting was an astonishing four and a half hour <i>tour de force</i> by Members of the Oireachtas who had put considerable time into preparation. It was a tragedy that it did not get more publicity in our media.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Likewise, the new half-yearly and annual ministerial reporting obligations, notwithstanding Senator Daly's concerns, will make an important contribution to the ongoing dialogue between the Oireachtas and the Government. Those reports and the annual report by the Committee on European Affairs to the Oireachtas will give the Members of both Houses an opportunity to assess the operation of the system. The system of parliamentary scrutiny, if implemented successfully, will lead to a new era of transparency and accountability, demonstrating to the public that the Oireachtas has a very direct input into EU legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I thank all those who made a contribution. The rules prohibit me from addressing each one of the contributions, one will be glad to hear, but they reflected a number of concerns that we all have going forward. The one point that can and should be made is that this is a start, not a final stage. We now have the opportunity to build on extremely good foundations. They are well laid in this legislation to bring the whole process of European lawmaking very much closer to the people and under much more direct scrutiny of the lawmakers of this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_323">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for bringing this timely Bill to the House. It was well overdue. I thank the Labour Party for initiating it last year. It is clear today that there is a consensus in the House and I hope it will have an impact on the final Nice referendum on Saturday.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford:</from>
          <p eId="para_324">I concur with what has been said by the previous two speakers. This, in its own way, is quite an historic day in the Oireachtas because we are enacting legislation that will change dramatically the way we do our business <i>vis-à-vis</i> European regulations, Commission proposals, etc. It will put an enormous new onus on each Member of the Oireachtas and I hope we are up to the challenge of responding. In terms of those who doubt the commitment of national politicians to do legislative work, there is a challenge for us as Members to show we are serious about our business.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Each Oireachtas committee will become a very important vehicle in the legislative process in coming years arising from the Labour Party Bill. I congratulate the Labour Party on bringing it forward and the Government for accepting it. It will certainly make a huge difference to the way in which we conduct politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I concur with those who said there is a challenge for the media in terms of the way in which they report our business. I hope one of the proposals of the outgoing committee on Dáil reform in respect of a designated Oireachtas television station will be acted upon in the near future because valuable work is being done in this House of which nobody is aware. The more we can transmit that work to the public, the better. I look forward to progress in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Again, I congratulate the Labour Party on this fine legislation and I hope that, during the term of this Seanad, we will also see other proposals from the Opposition side enacted by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">I appreciate the thanks that have been proffered to the Labour Party on this Bill. Let me reciprocate by thanking other colleagues for their support. The legislation does not in itself bring about accountability or transparency but it gives us the mechanism whereby it can happen. It requires a commitment from the Government and by every Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure it becomes a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I hope that in passing this Bill we are also sending out the signal that we are listening. A concern expressed at the time of the first Nice treaty referendum was that the democratic deficit was not being addressed. This legislation is a serious effort on the part of the Houses of the Oireachtas to address it and the message should go out to the public that we are listening to the concerns of people and doing what we can to address them.</p>

        <heading>Recognition of Domestic Partnerships:   Motion.</heading>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_111">
          <from>Mr. Norris:</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_330">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_331">That Seanad Éireann, in the light of the recent Equality Authority Report, requests the Government to give an assurance that it will either accept from the Independent benches or introduce on its own initiative legislation to cover the recognition of domestic partnerships.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I welcome the Minister of State. I look forward to an interesting, positive and constructive response in the tradition of Fianna Fáil in these areas. The contributions of the former Minister for Justice, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in the 2000 budget are examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">It is very appropriate for the Seanad to try to push forward social change in a non-confrontational manner. This issue affects a very large section of Irish society nowadays and it should not become a matter of partisan dispute. It is regrettable that so little notice is given of Private Members' debates. I had hoped that people would have had more time to prepare for this debate. I received the Government amendment only this morning and I regret that it put one down. It kicks to touch in calling for us to wait until the relevant reports have been received. One of them has already been launched with a great fanfare. However, given that the third part of the motion commits the House to further review of the situation when the totality of reports has been produced, I will not force a vote but will accept the amendment because I believe in a constructive approach to these human problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">One report has already been published. It is very significant and I intend to refer to it in this debate. It has also been adopted by the NESC and taken on board by the National Economic and Social Forum, under the direction of Dr. Maureen Gaffney. I understand that substantial meetings have already taken place and that this group, under the provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, has requested feedback from the various Departments concerned, which are listed in the report as requiring to undertake certain things. Successful meetings have also been held with Secretaries General of a number of Departments, which is a very positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">In the run-up to the last general election, <i>Gay Community News,</i> a very good and well-informed newspaper which may not have wide circulation among Members of this House, conducted a survey over a period of months of the various parties and their attitude toward items of particular interest to the gay community. With the exception of Fianna Fáil, every party positively endorsed partnership rights and said they would introduce legislation in this area. Some even went so far as to indicate they would include adoption. The stance of Fianna Fáil was neutral. It indicated it did not have a policy at this time, which I do not regard that as a negative stance. The junior party in Government, the Progressive Democrats, has committed itself to legislation. That is a very positive framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I mentioned the question of the gay community. If only it was affected this debate would be rather narrow and I would not have put down this motion for this, the principal debate in the House on Wednesday evenings. However, the subject of the non-recognition of partnerships outside marriage now covers a considerable number of young Irish citizens who, for one reason or another, have chosen to establish their family units outside the conventions of church or even State marriage. I have a very helpful young American assistant who has produced interesting statistics. The birth rate for 2001 was a total of 57,882 babies, of which 18,049 – 31% – were born outside marriage. In the first three months of this year that has increased to 33%. That is the dimension of the problem we are dealing with. In other words, it is concerned with those who do not have the same rights as people who are married conventionally.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The traditional wisdom in an Ireland that has now changed was that people should be penalised, especially financially, for attempting to make these arrangements outside the strict definition of marriage. However, in justice, fairness and in a spirit of social constructivism, it is wrong to continue this penalisation because when people have decided to create these relationships they need to be supported and given encouragement, in the interests of a stable community. The Seanad ought to be able to provide a framework for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I have attempted to place this motion in this broad context because it is the best way to proceed. Members of this House had a series of discussions with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, about the discriminations involved in inheritance tax and capital acquisitions tax, especially as it relates to the inheritance of property by those who are not recognised as spouses. We did not go into the question of what, if any, sexual relationships existed between them because that is a private matter and none of our business. The Minister was persuaded of this and introduced a very helpful measure in budget 2000. That was won because it arose in the context not only of specific gay cases, but of a general principle that affected unmarried people regardless of their sex in the unconventional arrangement or marriage.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">However, there is one thing that makes it more difficult for gay people and the discrimination far more intense because in the case of heterosexual couples there is always the option of marriage. That option is permanently foreclosed for gay people under the present legislation. As far back as 1967, when Declan Costello produced his constitutional review, even though there was no hint or suggestion that people were considering this kind of same sex relationship recognition, the report said it would not in any circumstances accept it. There was a strong traditional commitment against it, which was unfortunate. Now, as we know, an increasingly large number of people are caught in this situation, whether or not they are gay.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">As legislators, and especially in this Upper House, we are required to try to make provisions for social change we observe on the ground and this social change has been observed. However, this does not mean a weakening of support for marriage. I am very happy to support marriage; it is a splendid institution. Nevertheless, nowadays in the 21st century, other forms of relationship equally deserve, if not the respect of the majority of the people, at least to be protected against penal discrimination.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I am not talking about gay marriage. I am so tired of that phrase because it is easy to mock. It establishes a ludicrous picture of two hairy legged men with handle-bar moustaches in white skirts holding hands as they walk up the aisle. It is very easy to dismiss that, but behind it is the human reality of people who are prevented from visiting their partner of 30 or 40 years in hospital, debarred from inheriting, penalised in income tax terms or are sacrificed in terms of mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I am not interested in the ludicrous notion of marriage that is so easy to mock in the tabloid newspapers. I am interested in the tangible, practical benefits that flow for citizens, be they gay or heterosexual, from the institution of marriage. Without diminishing the status of marriage we must look at its inherent inequity because it is not extended to all people.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">There is a certain element of difficulty in this as I have sometimes criticised the Vatican, but now I am in a situation where I can criticise my own church – the Church of Ireland. The Bishop of Tuam recently issued an edict forbidding ceremonies of affirmation of the friendship and love of a lesbian couple. I thought that was extraordinary. I wrote to the bishops of the Church of Ireland some years ago asking them to interfere to stop Drumcree and they said they could not. They can interfere and intervene to stop a service that affirms love and friendship but they cannot apparently stop one that foments and spreads hatred and division.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The day after I thought this, I listened to a charming priest of the Roman Catholic Church from Glasthule, accompanied with various sound effects, talking about the blessing of animals. He was blessing hamsters and goldfish and Great Danes.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_112">

        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Mr. Norris:</from>
          <p eId="para_346">Would it not strike one as a bit odd that they could not bless a pair of unfortunate lesbians along with the hamsters, goldfish and everything else? There is a kind of a disproportion there and it is rather a pity.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I have already praised the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for his work on capital acquisitions tax. The Equality Authority has produced a really important series of documents in addition to its report. I recommend the one to this House entitled Partnership Rights of Same Sex Couples because it deals with all the principal issues, such as adoption. One should not get side-tracked by the notion of gay adoption as it is a tiny insignificant element. There are only about 100 adoptions in the whole State every year anyway. I have not heard of one difficulty regarding a gay adoption but it is something that needs to be addressed in legal terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">There was a case recently of two young businessmen who had children as a result of some advanced technique in America using the sperm of one of the partners who is the natural father, which left the rights of the children and also of the partner in abeyance in legal terms. This is a very rare occurrence but it should be addressed by the law. We are not suggesting we are paving the way for widescale gay adoptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Then there is the question of <i>force majeure</i>. If one is not married to somebody who is hospitalised because of a serious illness or accident, one is not taken into account. Those who saw that wonderful film “Philadelphia” will recall the scene between Miguel, the boyfriend played by the famous Spanish actor, Antonio Banderas, and the doctor treating Tom Hanks. He was Hanks's long-term partner and wanted to talk about the situation but was told by the doctor that as he was not family he had no standing. He was at risk of being thrown out of the hospital after living with Hanks and caring for him for some 20 years. That also affects heterosexual individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">In the Civil Service people are required to pay into a pension scheme which provides a benefit for widows and orphans that can only be claimed by people who are married in the conventional sense. What about the spouses of people who are outside – unmarried heterosexual people living together with children? They are debarred from a scheme into which they have paid. That seems to be a denial of natural justice. There is a whole section in the document to which I referred dealing with pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">There is also the issue of tenancy rights. In this House we discussed in the past few years the situation of somebody who had been living in Pembroke Cottages. He had lived with his partner for 30 years and had contributed to the rent. When the partner died he was put out on the side of the road as his name had not been on the tenancy agreement. That was the law of the land and it was wrong. That is something that could be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">With the indulgence of the Acting Chairman I will leave this list and come back to it later on because I want to make a couple of suggestions that I would hate not to get looked at. I am grateful to the Leader of the House for the sensitive and intelligent way in which she has dealt with getting this issue on to the Order Paper. It is very interesting that we have just finished dealing with an item of legislation that came from a Labour Party initiative. That is a very good thing. Let us have more legislation that will give a profile to the Seanad. Let us have it, for example, come from the Independent benches or from an all-party group. I call on the House to provide the assistance of the expertise of draftspersons for legislation it deems to be serious because, by and large, we are not capable of doing it for ourselves. I ask the advice of the Leader and other leaders on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">I have established a small committee of expert people in this area to review the law with a view to producing some kind of decent legislation. At the moment we are reviewing all the European legislation in this area. We would like to do something that would do this House, the Government and the country proud. In the past we gained tremendous credit in Europe for some of our anti-discrimination legislation, much of which originated in this House, because we were advanced and we are traditionally seen as a rather conservative country. They were amazed at what we were doing. Let us amaze them again. The expert colleagues on my committee would be delighted if, from time to time, representatives of different parties from the Seanad were prepared to sit in on our meetings, even if just at the end to see if we can put together something that would give justice to a whole range of people who now live decent lives but outside traditional marriage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_114">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole:</from>
          <p eId="para_354">I compliment Senator Norris on putting down this issue for debate. It is something we have to address. I join with him in his words of praise for the Leader who has worked hard to put a sensitive amendment to it. I cannot disagree with it but I wish she could have gone a bit further.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Some 12 years ago Senator Norris asked me, as the co-ordinator of the Independent Members in the Seanad, to get Government time allocated to discuss the question of AIDS. At the time it was considered to be extraordinarily <i>avant garde</i> to have such a debate. Many people avoided having anything to do with it. The Government, and it was the Leader's party in government at the time, did agree to provide time. We did not want a divisive debate but simply wanted to raise the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Tonight's motion does not in any way reflect Senator Norris's strong views on this issue. He has put a sensitively worded motion together in order to allow people to address the subject without creating a sense of division, which is not the objective. He discussed it in great detail with me and I know how much he wants the matter to be addressed. There is a real human issue here. The debate should not simply focus on the issue of gay marriages or adoptions – they are certainly a factor, but let us take it one step at a time and look at the point of this motion tonight. It aims to give recognition to people who have committed their lives together whatever their marital status, gender or sexual orientation. In that sense it is no different from many of the other legislation we have put through these Houses to ensure equality and equity for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">This motion is as much about equity as it is about equality and that is crucial to the issue. In many ways the equality debate has advanced significantly over recent years. In dealing with this issue we must be sensitive. We have to give strength to people who are in clandestine relationships, for the want of a better word, those who are in relationships in which they feel slightly threatened. We cannot change that aspect of things in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Perhaps Senator Norris will disagree on this point but I always advise people who have a gay sexual orientation not to feel any need to tell the world about it. It is their own business and they should hold it that way. Senator Norris has taken a certain stance on this for which I have admired and supported him. However, it is not an issue. I was probably the last person in Ireland to know Senator Norris was gay. We were both elected on the same day in 1987. I knew he was involved in gay rights, but so was I. I also knew that many involved in gay rights were not necessarily gay. When I asked him whether he was gay, it was the only time I have ever seen him stuck for words in the 15 years I have worked with him in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">People should be able to live their lives in equity and equality without it being necessary for them to make a public statement about their gender or sexual orientation. This should not be a necessity; it is a matter of choice and should remain so. This is where we move forward. It is when we say to the members of our groups who feel slightly or marginally uncomfortable and consider it less than macho to deal with this "sissy" stuff that it involves issues which are real in society and that wherever we live – city or country, town or village – there are people who feel threatened by the fact that they feel different to others. We should say to them that that is their business and that we do not need to know these intimate matters about them. We should also say that, if people commit to each other in a domestic arrangement, whatever the nature or level of their relationship, they should be able to do so in a way that is recognised by the law in terms of superannuation and pension rights of a surviving partner, wills and probate and the right of the surviving partner to have a claim on the estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">I ask in this discussion that people leave the word "sex" out of it and let us discuss people. It is irrelevant whether partnerships are man and woman, man and man or woman and woman. That is the reason they are not referred to in the motion. Members should take their courage in their hands and say it is not up to us to make judgments or set the ethical standards for others, rather that we should set the standards for everyone and do so guided by equality and equity, especially on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">This debate is important and we are the pointguards on this issue. People will look back on the debate and note that, while in contributing to it they may not have been completely certain about the issues, they believed fair play to be important wherever it arose. We, as legislators and public representatives, must see to it and ensure there is fairness, regardless of whether it applies to those who are different to us in terms of gender orientation or the nature of their partnerships. We must recognise and respect that. This is about the respect people have for each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">There is no doubt that we have been reared in and I have been educated in and, in turn, been an educator in an education system which passes on to a new generation the beliefs, customs, mores and norms of the previous one. There is nothing wrong with this, but it is up to us, the leaders in society, to push out the boundaries as we go along to ensure people will always look at the new situation and deal with it properly and openly. It should not be a surprise to anyone that either we or the people we know have a difficulty with the types of issues with which we are dealing. That is not a matter which should be sneered at, dismissed or ignored. It is a matter of people recognising that they must educate and inform themselves on these issues. On that basis we must be the leaders who show the way and say to the Government it should take its courage in its hands and move this forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I know the Minister of State will have an open mind on this matter and move the issue forward. Senator Norris has graciously accepted the tone of the amendment on the basis of the last line: "[We resolve] to consider this issue further when all of these reports are available." There is no shame in the Government saying it does not believe we are ready for this legislation just yet, that people need to read through it to bring themselves along. These reports when they come through – some are already available – will help them in this regard. They have been compiled by people who are not crusaders or zealots in these areas. They are people who are examining society and speak with the generality of society in mind in trying to get the fairest and best way possible. It gives me great pleasure to second the motion and I compliment Senator Norris on tabling it for discussion.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea):</from>
          <p eId="para_370">I thank Senators Norris, O'Toole, Henry and Ross for taking the initiative in tabling their motion because it gives the House an opportunity to debate this important issue. As we know, the family based on marriage was overwhelmingly the norm in Irish society for many generations. However, this has been greatly affected by changing social trends in recent years. Specifically, we have seen a marked growth in households consisting of co-habiting couples who are unmarried with, in some cases, their children or the children of one partner. In addition, we have same sex couples whose situation was the primary focus of the report of the Equality Authority referred to in the motion. Therefore, this debate is timely.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the Equal Status Act, 2000, provide protection against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, marital status and family status, among others. These Acts prohibit discrimination in employment and the provision of goods, services, facilities, accommodation and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The Equality Authority established an advisory committee on lesbian, gay and bisexual issues in 1999. The committee produced a report entitled, Implementing Equality for Lesbians, Gays and Bisexuals, which was published by the Equality Authority in May 2002 and which we are discussing. The report made 88 recommendations for action covering all areas of society under the following headings: community development and empowerment, equality proofing, partnership rights, health, education, youth services, employment and training, services generally and violence and harassment. It will be clear, therefore, that the report covers a broad subject matter which relates to several Departments, public bodies and the private sector. It also deals with an exceptionally complex and sensitive area on which there can be no sudden rush to conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Earlier this year the National Economic and Social Forum agreed to examine the implementation issues arising from the report. The forum was established by the Government in 1993 to achieve consensus on as wide a basis as possible on major economic and social policy issues. Since 1998 its work is focused on evaluating the implementation of policies dealing with equality and social inclusion issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">It was also agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that the social partners would consider how recommendations emerging from the authority's report would be carried forward. This project will involve new working methods and a role for the forum in the policy-making cycle. The forum has established a project team to progress this work. The team, which has met twice to date, includes representatives of employer and trade union organisations, representatives of relevant community and voluntary sector organisations, an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a local authority representative.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The team has agreed in its terms of reference to consult relevant Departments and other bodies regarding the implementation of the main recommendations of the Equality Authority's report. The team will, adopting a problem-solving approach, pay particular attention to identifying potential implementation barriers and challenges on the main priorities as identified by the team and comment and advise on how these may be resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Relevant Departments have been contacted and asked to outline the actions which have already been taken or which they plan to undertake regarding the recommendations, any barriers they envisage in the implementation of these recommendations and how the Departments may overcome these barriers. The team may also consult other bodies regarding implementation of the recommendations, as it considers appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The team will report back findings and recommendations to the forum by the end of the year. In keeping with forum procedure, the report will be sent directly to Cabinet for consideration prior to publication. It is important to point out that the Government has not had the benefit yet of the results of the work, given that it is still ongoing. Therefore, much as I compliment the Senators for raising the issue at this time, I cannot agree with the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">On the question of recognition of partnership rights, which is the specific concern of the motion of Senator Norris and his colleagues, the Equality Authority's report examines the existing law in Ireland and developments in a number of western European countries. It is clear that in countries such as the Netherlands, France, Germany and the Nordic countries, same sex relationships are accorded a form of legal recognition in themselves. Uniquely in Europe, in the Netherlands, the law expressly provides that a marriage can be contracted by two persons of different sex or of the same sex. In some of the states reviewed in the report, the institution of registered partnerships is only open to same sex couples while in others it is open also to heterosexual couples. Denmark is an example of the first type. The report indicates that in 1989 Denmark became the first country to introduce a law on registered same sex partnerships guaranteeing essentially the same rights to such a partnership as to a married couple, except that registered partners cannot adopt children.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">This highlights an important distinguishing feature between the suggestion that there should be legal recognition of co-habitation, such as registered partnerships, irrespective of the sexual orientation of the participants, and the idea that such an institution should only be available to same sex partners as in Denmark and, according to the report, also in Germany. Same sex partners do not have the possibility of marrying each other and, therefore, may seek a form of legal recognition analogous to marriage. On the other hand, heterosexual co-habitees normally have the option of marrying and may be co-habiting for any one or more of a number of reasons. It may be a precursor to getting married or because they do not want to accept the legal incidents of marriage or because one or both partners may not be free to marry at the time or because they reject marriage as an institution for whatever reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The report recommends a reform to extend the legal and other benefits enjoyed by heterosexual marriage to unmarried heterosexual couples and same sex couples. In particular, it recommends that the legal and policy codes should be systematically reformed to ensure that references to the family recognise the diversity of family forms, households and couple relationships. The report envisages that couples could have a range of options including legal marriage, registered partnerships and recognised households. There would be rights to nominate a partner or successor; designate a next-of-kin for medical issues; nominate a beneficiary of pensions and inheritance; and nominate a partner as a co-parent or guardian of a child.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The report recommends that domestic violence legislation should operate on an equal basis towards same sex relationships as towards married relationships. It also recommends changes to immigration, leave entitlements, taxation, social welfare, housing, parenting, adoption and fostering laws and arrangements so as to accord rights to same sex partners and unmarried, heterosexual partners equal to those enjoyed by married spouses.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">In general, the report adopts a far reaching approach in its recommendations, going through the various areas of law and proposing that the situation of same sex couples should be enhanced so that it is essentially the same as that of a married couple. This is a very radical approach in an area of particular sensitivity, which goes beyond the position in some of the European countries discussed in the report. As such, it is not realistic of the Senators to expect that, a matter of months after publication of this report, the Government should commit itself to legislating on the subject before there has been the opportunity to consider fully the issues involved. What has been done is to set in train a process, which I have just described, to examine under the aegis of the National Economic and Social Forum the question of implementing the report's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">As far as partnership rights are concerned, I think it would also be beneficial if there was more public debate on the recommendations in the report and I hope that our debate here this evening might provide the stimulus for that. The changes suggested by the authority are, as I said, far reaching, proposing as they do an equal status for different partnerships with that of married couples. Such changes, if they are to be made, will require careful consideration from the constitutional standpoint. As Senators know, constitutional recognition of the family is confined to the family based on marriage. Article 41 provides that the State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack. I do not know if the proposals in the report are consistent with this constitutional commitment because no advice has to date been obtained on the question. What is clear is that there needs to be thorough debate and reflection on the changes proposed rather than a rush to introduce legislation straight away.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">As legislators, we need to be conscious of the different perspectives that are bound to exist in Irish society concerning the type of proposal which is made in the report. We must recognise the social change that has been taking place in our country but this does not imply that we must, without adequate consideration, decide that we are going to alter radically the legal basis of family life in Ireland. Put simply, we need to have regard also to voices other than that of the Equality Authority in deciding how to progress from here.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">There is a further reason why the commitment, sought by the Senators in their motion, would be premature. The Law Reform Commission, as part of their second programme of law reform approved by Government, is examining the topic of the rights and duties of co-habitees. I understand that the commission hopes to publish a consultation paper next year. The expertise and independence of the Law Reform Commission makes it highly desirable that the Government and this House should have the benefit of its research in this complex area before taking decisions on the appropriate course of action. The consultation process in which the commission typically engages before making final recommendations will also elicit the views of experts in various fields and will provide an opportunity to engage with the general public on the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I turn now to some specific points and recommendations in the chapter of the report dealing with partnership rights with a view to outlining the current position. The chapter refers to the issue of Civil Service pension arrangements, under which pensions are provided for the surviving spouses of married members. The terms of this scheme were considered by the Commission on Public Service Pensions. The commission, which drew together the views of unions, management and independent pensions experts, recommended a provision to allow payment of a pension to a financially dependent partner in certain circumstances. Two members of the commission entered a reservation in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The Government has accepted the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and has established a working group, as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, comprising representatives of management and unions to advise on implementation. The operational details of the implementation of the commission recommendations are to be agreed by Government following receipt of a report from this group, which is expected later in the year. Pending receipt of this report, it is not possible to give a more definitive response on this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The suggestion that legislation governing violence in intimate relationships should operate on an equal basis towards same sex couples as towards married relationships can be considered either in the context of legislation resulting from the Supreme Court judgment of last week on <i>ex parte</i> interim barring orders or other appropriate future legislation. As is noted in the report, under the Domestic Violence Act, a person who has lived with the alleged violent person as husband or wife, although the couple are not married to each other, can in certain circumstances apply for a safety or a barring order. Also, a person who resides with the respondent in a relationship, the basis of which is not primarily contractual, may apply for a safety order.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">With regard to parental leave, a working group, which comprised representatives of the social partners, certain Departments and the Equality Authority, was set up in accordance with a requirement of the Parental Leave Act, 1998, to conduct a review of its operation within three years. The requirement was also incorporated as a commitment in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The report of the working group was published in April 2002. The group identified 18 issues for consideration in the course of the review and made a series of recommendations in relation to some of these issues. One of the ten recommendations agreed by the group is that a workable legal formula should be developed to extend parental leave entitlement to persons acting <i>in loco parentis</i>. This would include persons who actively parent but are neither natural nor adoptive parents. This recommendation along with the others made by the working group is currently being examined by my Department with a view to bringing forward legislative proposals to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">In regard to social welfare, section 3(12) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, defines spouse for the purposes of the Act as each person of a married couple who are living together, or a man and woman who are not married to each other but are cohabiting as husband and wife. This definition is based on the outcome of the Hyland case in 1987, which dealt with the level of payments received by married couples and those who are co-habiting. The latter had been treated as single people and received two full payments, which placed married couples at a disadvantage as they received approximately 1.6 times the personal rate. As a result of this case and in order to ensure that married couples did not receive less favourable treatment than a co-habiting couple, the definition of a married couple was widened, for social welfare purposes, to include co-habiting couples. Payments to co-habiting couples were then adjusted downwards to bring them into line with those of married couples. I understand that this is the position in respect of social welfare payments generally, but does not apply for the purpose of eligibility for widow's or widower's pensions where co-habitation is not recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">On adoption, the legal position is that under section 10 of the Adoption Act, 1991, only a married couple can adopt jointly. Two unmarried persons of whatever sexual orientation cannot adopt jointly. A single person can adopt where it is considered desirable in the interests of the child, but any partner of the adopting parent would have no rights in relation to the child. I am informed by the Department of Health and Children that there are no current proposals to change the law in this regard, but there is an ongoing review in progress in relation to all aspects of adoption. One of the subgroups of the project team carrying out the review has recommended that where there is a pre-existing relationship between an unmarried couple and a child, it should be made legally possible for an adoption order to be made in favour of the couple.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The picture which emerges is that our law recognises cohabitation for certain purposes, though there is no particular institution or status for cohabitees as such. As I said, reforms are under consideration in a number of areas which would benefit cohabitees, but we must consider carefully, consult widely and not necessarily take all our inspiration from the one report in deciding on the reforms that need to be made. In this regard, we have the process set in train by the National Economic and Social Forum to consider how to respond to the report and the ongoing work of the Law Reform Commission on the rights and duties of cohabitees. In the light of these developments, the Government motion proposes that the House should resolve to consider the issue further when all the relevant reports are available.</p>

        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Ms Terry:</from>
          <p eId="para_393">I welcome the Minister of State and thank Senator Norris for taking the initiative in tabling this motion. I accept also that the Leader has tabled an amendment which is acceptable to Senator Norris.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Fine Gael is supportive of any moves to recognise the partnerships of same sex couples and non-married cohabiting heterosexual couples. There is an urgent need to eliminate disadvantage and social exclusion and thereby accommodate diversity of sexual orientation in Irish society. Many people live in relationships which are not recognised and this leads to discrimination; in certain cases it can lead to violence and harassment at work or on the street. It is time to face up to these problems and take the necessary action to give these relationships a legal basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The recommendations contained in the recent Equality Authority report which relate specifically to lesbians, gays and bisexuals are many and varied. Many of them apply to heterosexual couples, but we are dealing tonight with gays, lesbians and bisexuals. The recommendations cover areas such as community development and empowerment, equality proofing, partnership rights, health, education, youth services, employment and training services as well as violence and harassment. It is an excellent report and when one reads it, it is shocking to see the lack of recognition of the gay, lesbian and bisexual community. Our legislation assumes that our population is made up of heterosexuals only and that all cohabiting couples are made up of men and women who are married. It is time we took on and changed this assumption, recognising the many people now feel alienated from their own society.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">What is needed? The report makes many excellent and essential recommendations and I will not go through them all, as the Minister of State has dealt with them, but equality proofing is absolutely vital. We are only coming to terms with this concept, but it is very important and should be implemented in all Departments and agencies in order that when legislation is in place, people will never again feel left out by our laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">In the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform the legal and policy codes should be reformed to ensure references to the family recognise the diversity of family forms, households and couple relationships. We live in a more open society today, but there is still significant discrimination which should be addressed in order that we can build a more inclusive and equal society. For example, we must ensure same sex couples and cohabiting single heterosexual couples enjoy the same legal rights as married couples. This would give recognition to their nominating a partner or successor, designating a next of kin for medical issues, nominating a beneficiary of pensions and inheritance and a partner as a co-parent or guardian of a child. Other issues to be addressed involve providing equal rights of residency and work entitlements for foreign partners of Irish citizens as those provided for married heterosexuals and issues relating to leave entitlements, such as parental leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The Department of Finance should make the necessary recommendations for change to the taxation system in line with according equal rights to same sex partners, unmarried heterosexual couples and married couples. Same sex and unmarried heterosexual couples both gain and lose from the fact that the social welfare code recognises only spouses and those living together as "husband and wife". The relevant legislation could be amended and the phrase "living together as husband and wife" replaced by some more broad formula such as "living together in a relationship akin to marriage". Issues such as capital gains tax, inheritance rights and property, parenting, pensions and healthcare have been covered very well by this report and need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">It is time to tackle these issues. Many of the issues to which I have referred apply to heterosexual cohabiting unmarried couples also. We cannot ignore these relationships any longer. We must shape a future for the entire community of Irish men and women, from all walks of life and regardless of their sexual orientation. Each one must be valued and accommodated by the larger society. It is up to us to move this forward and change people's views and opinions. This debate is the start of that process. People are more open to these ideas today, but it is up to each of us to bring the debate to the people and stand up and say we will not bury our heads in the sand any longer. People have been living in these relationships for many years and oppressed, but we do not want our people to live like that any longer. They need to be open and able to live in the society to which we all aspire – a society of equality and freedom in which one can express one's beliefs and feelings.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_118">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh:</from>
          <p eId="para_400">I welcome this debate and the reasoned approach taken by Senator Norris, who proposed it. These are issues which must be addressed in a republican society. If we value equality, we must address equality issues. In the area of equality, women would have felt disadvantaged in society in the past. Great advances have been achieved in that area. The European Union has been effective in bringing about positive changes. Equal pay was achieved as a result of European directives and we are moving towards more equality and fairness in the area of social security payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">An audit published in June 2000 examined the situation regarding same sex couples under various headings. The Equality Authority as a body has a very important input to the evolution of policy and in the subsequent drafting of legislation. This report must be examined in the context of other reports and analyses. This document contains much good material but not all of it would find universal approval or support. I have a small criticism of the Equality Authority regarding its recent ruling that children of any age should be permitted in licensed premises at any hour of the day or night. Such a proposal goes against common sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">As a consequence of not having some form of qualitative evaluation by the authority, the report is not as strong as it might be otherwise. Certain areas could have been prioritised and there is an overwhelming case to be made for changes in legislation. We have come a long way in the area of equality in recent decades but the removal of discrimination against minorities or sections of society still remains to be addressed. Social inclusion is a pre-requisite for a republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Other Members may disagree with my view of the report's recommendation that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism should support events such as gay festivals. Senator O'Toole alluded to this in his contribution and I believe that sometimes the accentuation of difference creates hostility and opposition. It is perhaps better to look at integration and, as a local representative, I have always advocated this approach. When local authorities decide to house Traveller families in groups in one estate, it tends to create a ghetto. I prefer a policy of integration in housing schemes where they will become part of the settled community, their children will be given better opportunities and they will not suffer the stigma which might be attached to people put together in one area. This approach would also apply to other minority groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Senator Terry referred to equality proofing, an initiative taken by the Equality Authority as a policy tool. The Good Friday Agreement provides for an equivalence of rights both North and South. Equality proofing has been mentioned as being applicable in such areas as poverty, health, disadvantage, social housing and training. The report states that many of the more liberal regimes within Europe are only now looking at changes in this area. I agree with the Minister of State that we should examine the implementation of changes in selective areas. Universal support is essential in the elimination of discrimination.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The issue of parity for same sex couples is currently receiving attention in some European countries. It has led to the registration of same sex partnerships. Senator Norris and Senator O'Toole outlined areas such as inheritance, taxation, pensions and health entitlements where it is of great importance to the individuals involved. Under existing legislation, the inheritance of the main residence can pass to the other person living in the house. I regard the recommendation that a person may nominate a beneficiary for inheritance or pension entitlements as very logical and it should be examined further.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I do not wish to nit-pick with the Equality Authority but one of the areas where I regard it as somewhat blinkered in its view is the statement regarding pensions where it says that legislation should be amended to read "nominated person" instead of "spouse", as designated by the employee. That could have dire consequences for those in the married state, particularly wives. They could be disadvantaged by that proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">I regard myself as a republican but perhaps Senator Norris would regard me as a conservative – I certainly lean more in that direction than towards being a liberal. It is important that any changes made do not undermine the strength and stability which the traditional married state gives to society. Heterosexual couples living together but not married have advantages in the social welfare system which work to the detriment of marriage. I do not believe that is a good trend. We must strike a balance between protecting the value of the traditional married family while ensuring the civil rights of other people.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Health is one of the key themes of the report. Many people who have found it difficult to disclose their sexual orientation have suffered great stress and the gay community should be given specific mechanisms to deal with that aspect. There should be equality throughout the whole educational system. The report deals with bullying and harassment. We should strive to eradicate homophobic bullying to satisfy the provisions of the Equal Status Act. The gay community has a role to play in this regard. Gay people should be advised not to make provocative displays of their sexual orientation because this, in turn, generates a reaction. I compliment Senator Norris on his approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Discrimination and alienation can occur in employment. It is essential that employer organisations and the trade unions play a positive role. They should ensure that any such behaviour is eradicated from the workplace. Minority groups are often victims of crime. The report's recommendations regarding violence and harassment are worth serious consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Intolerance of minorities is unacceptable in a republican democracy such as ours. Respect for human beings, regardless of class, colour, creed or sexual orientation, is a priority. In fact, it is probably a prerequisite for a civilised society and the Legislature, which must also operate for the common good. Within that framework we should address the issues before us. We should move forward in a measured way to achieve widespread public support as being essential to gaining public acceptance which, in turn, underpins equality in practice.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Dr. Henry:</from>
          <p eId="para_411">I support Senator Norris's motion and commend the Government on its amendment which does not take away from the motion. I am concerned by the possible suggestion that this project could, in any way, be an attack on the family because we must consider the fact that families are diverse in their composition. I speak as president of Cherish, an organisation set up in the early 1970s by single mothers for single mothers because it was believed that no such person existed in those days. Now many women rear children on their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">We have to take into account that there is a diverse group of people whom we might describe as families. Frequently, two people of the same sex bring up children together as sometimes do people who are alone. I am concerned that sometimes the children concerned are disadvantaged because of our attitude. Senator Norris's motion encourages the idea that we must ensure all the nation's children are cherished equally, as stated in the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">There was a great deal of excitement following the announcement that same sex couples should be allowed to adopt children. I remember I was asked to comment before I had the chance to read it. However, as has been pointed out, the purpose was that one member of a couple could adopt the other's children to ensure inheritance rights and so forth. What fascinates me is that such couples could so easily lie because single people can adopt children. One member of a couple could come forward to adopt a child. By encouraging a falsehood, they would be in a position to adopt, but if they came forward and honestly said they were a same sex couple, they would have problems with adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">We must be careful to encourage people to make honest declarations about their situation. This is causing problems in the case of young women claiming single mothers' allowance, even though there is a man living in the house who may be the father of the child. It is a good idea that children have two parents – I am a bit like Lady Bracknell in that regard. While I understand it being considered undesirable if both are drawing social welfare as it is felt one is drawing unfairly, one must also think of the common good. It is as well to allow a little leeway to encourage a stable relationship to be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Research was undertaken recently on pregnancy among teenagers and the figures are no greater now than they were in the 1970s. In the 1970s teenagers were briskly married off if they became pregnant. I will not enter a sociological discourse as to whether it is better that they should be married or stay single. However, we should recognise that if we are to encourage the welfare of children, in particular, we should remember that these relationships can be important and that it may work to the benefit of the child in the long-term to perhaps occasionally turn a blind eye, which we are particularly good at doing in various situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Senator Walsh mentioned health. Many people in single sex relationships, or even before they became involved in relationships, realised that their sexual orientation was different from what was more publicly recognised which has caused dreadful stress and, in some cases, mental illness. The incidence of suicide is higher among teenagers or young people who feel they are gay. It is important we try to ensure we address the issue in a sympathetic way, as Senator Norris has tried to do. We should be up front and say it is important from a public health point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">I never understood the reason stability in gay relationships was not encouraged because from a health point of view it would be far better. I do not know how many Members have read the dreadful story of the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in America, <i> And the Band Played On</i>. One could see where the marginalisation of the gay community allowed a situation to develop where there were more casual sexual relationships than there would have been if people had been permitted to be in stable relationships. That is one of the basic issues at which we have to look.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">We are always trying to encourage constancy in heterosexual relationships. Perhaps it would be a good idea if we did the same in the case of same sex relationships. There has been a sixfold rise in heterosexual HIV infection in this country in recent years. Newly diagnosed cases, where men have had sex with men, have doubled since 1998, but have not increased as fast as the incidence among the heterosexual community. We should be careful not to minimise the importance of encouraging people to stay in monogamous relationships. Why should it just apply to heterosexual couples? I have never understood that. Encouraging stability in a community where relationships are between people of the same sex is important from a public health point of view. I commend Senator Norris on the motion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Mr. Minihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_419">It is timely such subjects are debated and I am happy Senator Norris has accepted the amendment tabled by the Government. I would, however, like to avail of the opportunity to speak on values which are close to my heart. I make no apology for supporting family values on which I base my political beliefs. Families are at the heart of our society and enshrined in the Constitution. Most of us live in families which we value because they provide love, support and care. They educate us and teach us right from wrong. Our future depends on their success in bringing up children. That is the reason we should be committed to strengthening family life.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">There is now a widespread recognition that a new approach to supporting the family is needed. Families are under stress. The rate of marriage breakdown is on the increase. More children are being brought up in single parent households and there is increased child poverty, often as a direct consequence of family breakdown. Rising crime levels and drug abuse are indirect symptoms of problems in the family.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Saying that families are a good thing is not enough. Good intentions need to be carried through in practice. Governments must be wary about intervening in areas of private life and intimate emotion. They need to approach family policy with a strong dose of humility. A modern family policy needs to recognise these new realities and be founded on clear principles. I suggest three such principles. First, the interests of children must be paramount. The Government's interest in family policy is primarily an interest in ensuring the next generation is given the best possible start in life. Second, children need stability and security. While marriage is still the surest foundation for raising children and remains the choice of the majority of people in Ireland, many lone parents and unmarried couples raise their children as successfully as married parents. Third, wherever possible, Governments should not try to substitute for parents but offer support to all parents so they can better support their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">There is no longer any credibility in either back to basics fundamentalism that tries to turn back the clock or anything goes liberalism that denies the fact that how families behave affects us all. The raising of children or the provision of care ought to be valued by society and everyone should have the chance to balance work and family commitments. Achieving that balance benefits us all. Families do not want to be nannied or to be nagged about how to raise their children, but they want support to be available when they need it. This may take the form of advice on relationships, help with overcoming difficulties, support with parenting and, should a couple's relationship break down, a system of divorce which avoids aggravating conflict within the family.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Marriage provides a strong foundation for stable relationships. This does not mean trying to make people marry or criticising or penalising people who choose not to marry. Governments should not interfere in people's lives in that way, but I share the belief of the majority of people that marriage provides the most reliable framework for raising children. We have to be realistic about how much can be achieved. Family matters are essentially private and individuals must live their own lives. What we must do is provide the best support we can and set out the rights and responsibilities of families clearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">All families face pressure in their everyday lives and all families want some measure of support, but a small portion of families encounter more serious problems and need particular help and assistance. Poverty, poor housing, social exclusion and a lack of opportunity are the root of many serious family problems. Our strategies on social exclusion should address serious underlying problems with children's learning, juvenile offending, teenage pregnancy and domestic violence. In considering these issues, I urge that we revisit our Constitution, in particular the section on fundamental rights which deals with personal rights, the family, education and private property. We should ask ourselves whether we are truly supporting our Constitution or merely paying lip service to it when we address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I welcome this debate and I look forward to legislation that will recognise all the associations and the relationships that are now enshrined in the society in which we now live.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Mr. Kett:</from>
          <p eId="para_426">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am happy to be here – it is my first time to speak since the election – and I am sure the Minister of State is of a similar mindset. I congratulate Senator Norris on bringing forward this motion. The Senator has been an ardent supporter of the marginalised, including those with disabilities. He spoke on many occasions in the last Seanad on disability issues, as I did. I know we have proposed an amendment to the motion, but the two marry very well.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The individuality of lesbian, gay and bi-sexual people is most marked by their lack of legal recognition. These marginalised people do not have the same rights as what is referred to as the traditional family. Unmarried heterosexuals have the option of marrying or rejecting marriage if they wish, but gay couples do not. They have no guarantee of protection and they would also say that they do not have fair treatment under the law, a point with which I agree. They are not recognised in any shape or form. Probably the worst manifestation of this is where a gay couple is living together and one of the partners dies. There is no recognition of the relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">That issue has been taken on board by some European countries in recent times to the extent that recognition of same sex partnerships is now relevant in terms of inheritance tax, pensions and health requirements. The Netherlands is probably way ahead of the posse on this issue – it has had full recognition of civil marriages between same sex couples since 2001 – but I do not foresee this country ever progressing to that extent. Denmark, Germany and France are moving in a similar direction, albeit more slowly, and other European countries such as Finland, Norway and Iceland are cherry-picking elements of legislation to suit their own particular needs in terms of same sex couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">It is understandable that we as a country are not moving at the same pace. We have to consider where we have come from in relation to where we are going and it is fair to say that the Netherlands was liberal when some people could not even spell the word. We are coming from a much more conservative, religion orientated tradition and we have a long way to go in terms of recognising the liberal agenda that countries like Norway and the Netherlands have championed. We have made progress and the outgoing Government moved significantly forward in the Equal Status Act, 2000, and the Employment Equality Act, 1998. These gave legal rights to marginalised people in a very meaningful way and the setting up of the Equality Authority brought about a new dawn for marginalised people, particularly lesbians, gays and bi-sexuals. They now enjoy greater protection than they did in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">In terms of that legislation, it could be said that we have taken on board the easier parts of the liberal agenda, but we must crawl before we walk and the motion is probably asking us to run a little. The Equality Authority set up an advisory committee under section 48 of the Equal Status Act, 2000, to investigate the rights of lesbians, gays and bi-sexuals in particular. It gave the committee terms of reference that included equality proofing and also partnership rights, which we are discussing tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">One of the committee's suggestions was that legal and policy codes should be reinforced to ensure that reference to the family took into account the diversity of families and recognised that a family is not just a husband and wife scenario but may reflect something different. It also suggested that the Government should ensure that same sex couples are dealt with in an equal way to traditional couples in terms of a partner's legal right to extend a right. The outcome of that would allow same sex couples to nominate a partner or a successor, to nominate a next of kin in terms of medical issues, to nominate a beneficiary for inheritance or to nominate a partner to co-parent, adopt or be guardian to a child. In terms of parental leave, it was recommended that same sex couples should have equal rights to traditional couples.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">If we go down this road, a whole plethora of changes will have to take place. Our taxation and social welfare systems will have to be examined, while another aspect is the provision of support housing. We all know how difficult it is to get a house. I have no idea what additional demands this would bring to bear on the housing situation which is already bursting at the seams, but that is a matter for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Employers would also have to look at a situation whereby they would protect the pension rights and health care benefits of spouses. Senators Norris alluded to the public service. Since 1984 public servants, married or otherwise, have to contribute to a spouses and children's fund which provides them with a pension in the event of the death of a spouse. In those circumstances no payment can be made to a member of a non-married couple or any of the children of that partnership. I have a certain sympathy for someone in that position. For example, where a woman walks out on a man and he eventually finds a new partner who lives with him for 25 years and raises his children, in the event of his death, the woman concerned has no claim on his pension good, bad or indifferent. We do not have to walk far from here to find people in that situation. This issue needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">In the private sector pension benefits can accrue to a same sex partner and their children. There are certain companies which operate this system. In the public service, the death-in-service benefit – a standard lump sum – can find its way to a spouse in any shape or form by means of a last will and testiment. In the private sector the death-in-service benefit is granted at the behest of the trustees of the holders of the fund. Unfortunately, if a trustee was not inclined to one's way of life, the trustee may decide to distribute the fund in a way that might not otherwise be fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">We are embarking on a real mindset in terms of where we are going on this issue. This is a debate to which we shall have to return many times before the end of this Seanad because the matter needs to be discussed on an ongoing basis. We are all changing in certain ways. This is the 21st century. In the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, we have a person who is open to meeting people, receiving submissions and willing to listen to the point of view of others. We can go forward in a positive way.</p>

They have long been neglected in society and their resolution will have far reaching effects right across the board in all sectors, families and relationships. That the report has been considered by Cabinet and referred to the above bodies and a firm commitment given to revisit the matter when they conclude their work indicates that the Government has a positive, supportive and constructive attitude to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">It is helpful that issues such as these are being brought to the forefront. Fianna Fáil has always been to the fore in pioneering social issues. On that note I strongly urge all sides to support and endorse the Government amendment which gives a clear commitment to revisit this important matter which should at that stage properly and rightly draw support from all sides of the House.</p>

I know Senator Minihan will not regard me as saucy or confrontational, but we all share the ideas of family which he espoused so defiantly and strongly. It is not a matter of saying one is for the family and raising the flag. That is not the point of this debate, but I accept the Senator's strong feelings.

          <p eId="para_445">We can all pat ourselves on the back and say, "What a good girl am I, am I?" or "What a good man am I, am I?" We are not trying to put a divide between people who love their families in whatever shape they may take. I accept that all human beings have an animal like attraction to family, to those they love and care for in whatever shape they may take. I accept that young children benefit from having two parents, whatever the relationship. This is not about driving a wedge between what would be regarded as traditional families and other families. It is about being inclusive and wishing to include in legal, social and family responsibilities all the various relationships which have sprung up which we have tiptoed around, talked about behind closed doors and hoped somehow would go away.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">In 1996 during the divorce referendum in the name of Senator Terry's party and that of the Labour Party when Fianna Fáil was in opposition and in favour of it, I recall taking part in several debates about the matter. I continued to say it was not sufficient to say that because one was happily married that everyone else who was not could stay in the condition in which they found themselves. That would be an entirely incorrect way to approach any huge social issue. We have to recognise that we cannot stay cocooned in our little blanket of comfort and think that because everything is all right with us, it had better be all right with everybody else in the same fashion, otherwise we will not pay any heed to it. That is a wrong way to approach very important issues. Relationships in whatever shape can be loving, strong and supportive, give comfort and succour and life long. Above all, they can give a sense of love and belonging for which so many long and so many, sadly, never achieve. I strongly endorse the idea that this House should discuss such issues. I accept that other people have very strong views but it would be wrong of me to expect everybody to share my point of view. There are many aspects to this issue which should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I read the equality report this afternoon and I share the views of Senators Kett, Feeney and Jim Walsh. There are major issues in the report to be addressed, particularly financial issues. The report has been referred to the National Economic and Social Forum which has begun its work. I telephoned the forum today to find out how far it has progressed in its work and I understand it has set up its project team on implementing equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people and also for men and women who are not in a marriage situation – Senator Norris is nodding so he must agree with me – although the report did not address that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The National Economic and Social Forum is awaiting the nominations of Oireachtas Members which was delayed due to the general election. An appropriate way for us to proceed would be to fill those vacancies – we would have to speak to the Chief Whip in the Dáil – because the forum is talking to its project team and awaiting its analysis and projections without the presence on the team of any Member of the Oireachtas. There is a strand on the project team for Oireachtas Members and we should put forward our nominees to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_453">It nominated Mr. Michael O'Donovan. The community and voluntary sector and the employer, trade union and farming organisations have also put forward nominees. I welcome the fact that a number of women were nominated because it is often the case that the nominees to those groups are grey suits.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">If this House is to establish part of its relevance, it should be willing to examine issues which, because of pressure of time or the confrontational way of doing business, the other House often does not have the opportunity to address. It does not often have people of courage who are prepared to put forward an idea and drag us into a debate on it such as the one we are having here tonight, which is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I welcomed Senator Norris's remarks, and those of Senator Joe O'Toole, that the issue should not be about identifying certain groups as being gay, lesbian or whatever. I long for the day when our society is inclusive and people of all partnership arrangements are not regarded as different but as part of an overall pattern of life. That is what life is all about. If we all had the same ideas and the same sexual impulses, what a dull and unreal world it would be. We all vary and the idea that we would somehow all be the same and erect a portcullis around us and say, "I am all right and everyone else must work out their own business", is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I hope this is the start of ongoing debate and that we will have nominees from the Dáil and the Seanad on the committee. The committee will then issue its findings, the matter will go to Cabinet, the findings will be published and we will address them at that time. The road is a long one and there are huge financial and legislative considerations to address, but let us keep our hearts up high. This is a project. It is also an adventure but, above all, it is an issue of fair play, equality and decency. Obviously I support our amendment, but I am glad the issue has reached the discussion stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">It was in 1969 and I was discriminated against while working in the Office of Public Works. My boss tried to keep me on but the rule in the Civil Service was that I had to resign when I got married.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I have been an active participant in events on the Garvaghy Road for many years and every 12 July I witness discrimination and racism. Members might be surprised that I would use that word but the overwhelming psychological pressure put on Catholics in the Garvaghy Road by the Unionist and loyalist communities is racism. I was shocked when I realised that.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">At a meeting of the parliamentary party today the Taoiseach said that Fianna Fáil is a socialist party. That is the reason I am a member of Fianna Fáil. I remind Senator Norris and Senator Henry of the Government's changes to the law that decriminalised homosexuality and that, in 1993, a Fianna Fáil Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, in response to the report of the Law Reform Commission, set the age of consent at 17 because that was the age of consent for heterosexual relationships. There was a hue and cry in society, and I will not go over all that again, but I reiterate that Fianna Fáil is a socialist party which wants a more inclusive society in which nobody feels pain or is discriminated against. When the Law Reform Commission issues its report, as it did in 1993, I am optimistic that Fianna Fáil will examine its recommendations in due time and take the lead on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I commend Senator O'Rourke on what I am sure Senator Norris will agree is an excellent amendment. I discussed this issue with work colleagues over the past few days and they asked me if I was talking about gay marriages, etc. We will have to deal with these issues in society but I welcome the views from both sides of the House and the fact that there was not one rigid view.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_137">
          <from>Mr. Norris:</from>
          <p eId="para_464">I thank my colleagues for such a wide-ranging, excellent and well-informed debate. I am extremely heartened by it. I should have not doubted it would happen when I look at my old friends and colleagues and my new friends with whom I spoke on the telephone, two gracious women Members of the Seanad, one on each side of the House. I spoke to them last night and I am not at all surprised that we had such a good debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, as a Minister in May 1993, introduced the category of sexual orientation into the list of items covered by the Employment Equality Act, 1977. I remember, as Senator White says, the days when former Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn was here. Mean-minded amendments were being put about, but she nailed her flag firmly to the mast of equality. She said she would require cogent and clear reasons to impose discrimination against any Irish citizen. As the Senator said, that was the kind of republican view with which I could find myself completely in agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I want to put this discussion in a wider context than that of the gay issue. I share Senator Minihan's feelings about the centrality and importance of the family. Nothing that gives others outside that convention support and help would in any sense diminish the family. In fact, it would strengthen it because it would bring us all into the same category and we could all encourage each other in our different family structures of love.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Lesbian and gay people suffer disproportionately. According to this excellent publication by the Equality Authority, Partnership Rights of Same-Sex Couples, lesbian and gay couples have no guarantee of fair treatment under the law because legally their relationships do not exist. The vulnerability experienced by all couples during times of death or serious illness of a partner and the anxieties involved in child-rearing and child custody are all exacerbated for same sex couples. My colleague, Senator Henry, quoted what she thought was the Constitution but was actually the 1916 Proclamation, which mentions cherishing all the children of the nation equally. It is chilling to hear that a certain section of society – let us forget that they are lesbian or gay – has no guarantee of fair or equal treatment under the law. This is from an agency established under law by this Oireachtas. That must give us pause for thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">I want to outline a few areas where there is a commonality of interest between gay and lesbian people and those who are heterosexual and outside marriage. What is striking in this book is that so many of these discriminations are shared. For example, it states that under the Family Law Act, 1995, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996: "following a judicial separation or divorce, a portion of the pension may be calculated and allocated to the spouse who is not a member of the pension scheme. By definition, this facility obtains only in relation to married persons." This means that not only gay couples but also everybody outside marriage is inhibited in the full exercise of their rights under this legislation, which was passed as recently as 1995. There is a certain equality in social welfare payments until the death of one partner. The social security system then starts to discriminate and survivors' pensions are payable only to the lawful spouses of deceased contributors. This means that a woman and her children could be discriminated against in exactly the same way as a gay couple. That is to be greatly regretted.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The legal rights of a spouse include one half of the net estate as a "legal right share". The report states: "There is no provision in the legislation to entitle a same sex partner (or an unmarried heterosexual partner) to a legal right share, irrespective of the length of the cohabitation." This refers not just to gay people but also to everybody outside marriage. Then there is protection against disinheritance and intestate succession. Outside marriage, where somebody dies without a will, the surviving spouse has no entitlement – again, this covers all people outside marriage. Then there are restrictions on the transfer of a family home – the famous Family Home Protection Act, 1976. That only applies inside marriage. If a person has lived with somebody for 20 years and had six children with them, it still does not matter – he or she is not consulted under the Act. It is exactly the same if one is a partner in a gay relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I want to make the point again that these issues seem to hit with monotonous regularity not just at gay people but also at everybody outside marriage. In the old days marriage was virtually universal. The continuing increase in births outside marriage may be regrettable and certainly shakes old fogeys like myself who are used to a more traditional arrangement, but just over one third of all births in the last quarter were outside marriage. How are we to protect the people concerned and their children, who are also citizens?</p>
          <p eId="para_471">On the question of cohabitation contracts, there is a celebrated case – Ennis <i>v.</i> Butterly – in which the judge found that this kind of thing was dreadful because it would undermine the family. That is a caricature of the kind of attitude taken by Senator Minihan. It was a very bad judgment. I do not see how cohabitation contracts could possibly undermine anything. I know that is not what Senator Minihan means. We will have decisions such as this in court unless we, as legislators, make changes. For that reason, I respectfully do not agree with one or two of the points made here this evening. To suggestions that we might pick a little bit here and a little bit there and make a little adjustment here and do a bit of a tweak on inheritance I say, “No”. We must take a central approach because the problem is a whole series of rights from which all those outside conventional marriage are debarred. This should be dealt with in a single clear and specific Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">To show Members the extent of discrimination which exists, which we really did not realise in the past, I will give the example of simple income tax. Married couples get specific benefits – 12, for the record – from which everybody else is debarred. There is a higher limit on the standard rate tax band for married one income families. Where both spouses are working, the standard rate tax band is twice the value of that of a single person. There is a home carer's allowance for one income families and double the mortgage interest relief limit available to a single person for a principal private residence. Trading losses incurred by one spouse can be set against the income of the other spouse. The two businessmen who had the children in California are very remarkable business people, but if one of them gets into trouble, he cannot write off his losses against the income of the other. Why not? It has nothing to do with sex – it is about money.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">Let us forget what people do. Perhaps I am unusual, but I hesitate to speculate on what virtually everybody else does sexually. I really do not want to know. I do not spend my time obsessing about what my colleagues in the Seanad do after about 11 p.m. when they get home to bed and hope they do not speculate about me, because it would be a nauseating prospect in the extreme.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">These matters are private and should be left so. There are public aspects such as tax, inheritance and the home in which the couple lives. Further benefits for married couples include tax relief for a spouse for VHI and other qualifying payments made for the other spouse and tax relief for one spouse on gifts made by the other. Medical expenses incurred or defrayed by one spouse can be claimed by the assessable spouse. Tax relief can be obtained by one spouse in respect of a person employed to take care of the incapacitated other spouse. These are very human things. Why should two people who have lived together for so long not be able to get some support when one is trying to provide medical succour to the person he or she loves and has loved for many years? For married couples, there is tax relief for part-time third level educational fees and training course fees paid by or for the other spouse. Service charges paid by one spouse can qualify for tax relief in the hands of the other spouse.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">The income tax system is weighted in favour of the married couple. Unmarried couples, irrespective of their sexual orientation, are taxed as single persons.

Let us urge the Law Reform Commission to report as speedily as possible and take up Senator O'Rourke's suggestion that we make sure the Oireachtas nominees to the NESF are good people. I hope this will happen – I am sure it will. With our small, amateur committee we do have a certain first-hand knowledge of the issues. I would be honoured and delighted to arrange, if possible, even one meeting with representatives of all the parties to see if we cannot get this important, non-confrontational issue put through the Seanad.

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Cardinal Healthcare, Longford.</heading>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_146">
          <from>Mr. Bannon:</from>
          <p eId="para_486">I thank the Minister of State for coming here this evening to deal with the need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make an urgent statement concerning the decision by Cardinal Health to defer its investment in Longford for at least two years. A positive statement is needed to lift commercial life in Longford and give a much needed economic boost to the entire region.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Following much speculation that a large multinational firm intended to make a substantial investment in Longford, an announcement was made finally by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, in December 2000. She declared that the pharmaceutical giant, Cardinal Healthcare, would invest £100 million in Longford in a state-of-the-art European headquarters to house both its manufacturing and technology divisions. It was claimed the project would transform the industrial make-up of County Longford and the surrounding counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Construction work on Cardinal Health's headquarters was due to begin in early 2002 and it was hoped to be operational by 2004, creating almost 1,400 jobs by 2006. As part of the agreement with the Tánaiste and Cardinal Health executives, Longford County Council was asked to provide land for the company at a cost of £3.5 million with a view to selling the land at a fixed price. Cardinal Health would immediately carry out an environmental impact study on the effects of this production on the site. Since purchasing the land, Longford County Council has been incurring interest charges of €190,000 per annum. Cardinal Health was to provide a mixture of employment, including IT, packaging services and industrial and manufacturing jobs. It would require a wide skill base and attract migrants back to the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Subsequent to the Tánaiste's announcement there has been an increase in construction and planning demands in the county. A significant number of new housing units received planning permission or are currently seeking planning permission. There are currently 2,000 residential units with planning permission or under construction and some awaiting planning permission. The announcement led also to new retail developments such as supermarkets and other retail units throughout the town and county. Planning permission has been approved for a new hotel with a bed capacity of 70<b/>while another with a bed capacity of 140 is going through the planning stage. These were regarded as part of the necessary infrastructure required by Cardinal Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">As everyone knows, several factories in Longford have closed in recent years and employment in the existing factories has fallen. The labour force in the county in 1996 was 12,000, therefore the job losses as a result of the closures and lay-offs in the factories amounted to 6% of the labour force. This is a very large percentage against which the Cardinal Health project would be equivalent to more than 11% of the labour force. Therefore, the employment situation in the county was set to be transformed.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">The people of Counties Longford and Roscommon are devastated at the news that the Cardinal Health project is to be deferred for at least two years, despite the Tánaiste and officials from Cardinal Health reaffirming their commitment on several occasions during the past two years that the project was on schedule for a planning application in 2002. We were reassured several times during the election campaign by Deputy Sexton, both in campaign literature and in press statements, that the project was delivered. On the night of Deputy Sexton's election the Tánaiste was satisfied the Cardinal Health project had delivered a Longford seat to the Progressive Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">In the light of these commitments and promises, the news of the deferral comes as a shattering blow to Longford and the surrounding area where it had been anticipated that the project would soon create more than 1,300 jobs. It was a major blow to the local economy where considerable investment has taken place in anticipation of the project. If these promises were made in any other country law suits would be taken against the State for blatant misguidance or the resignation of the Minister who misled the public would be demanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">At the very least, the Government owes the people of Longford an apology for buying the election with the Cardinal Health project which will not now be delivered within the promised timescale. The Government has cynically exploited for its own political gain the urgent need for investment in Longford. It has undermined the level of confidence generated by the announcement. All our hopes have now been shattered. The people of Longford deserve an official response. There is an expectation that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should issue this response.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The whole episode raises very serious questions about the commitment of the Government and State agencies in regard to supporting employment opportunities in Longford. What about the promise of the natural gas board? What about the promised delivery of the broadband communications service, the new ESB grid and the long-awaited 24-hour emergency service? There would need to be an emergency during normal hours because there is no 24-hour emergency service in Longford.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">It is crucial that the Tánaiste should set up a special task force for the county which will deliver work in tandem with the people and Government agencies to attract significant industrial investment to Longford in the short-term. Longford has major advantages for industry. It is a superb location with good access routes. Land for industrial development is readily available and there is a well educated work force with skilled graduates willing to return to Longford. However, these people must currently leave the county to find decent employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">There is a compelling case for Longford to be included in any new decentralisation programme drawn up by the Government. The location of a major Government agency and Department in Longford would go a long way to lift the commercial life in the area and give a much needed economic boost to the region.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy):</from>
          <p eId="para_497">Déanaim comhgairdeas ó chroí leis na Seanadóirí a ath-tofadh agus leis na Seanadóirí nua. Déanaim comhgairdeas speisialta leatsa, a Chathaoirligh, as ucht a bheith tofa mar Chathaoirleach ar an tSeanad. Tá meas mór agam ar an dTeach seo agus ar an gcaighdeán ard díospóireachta polaitíochta atá le fáil anseo le blianta fada. Tá mé féin agus mo chomhghleacaithe sa Rialtas ag súil go mbeidh seans againn comhoibriú libh ar feadh cúig bliain, ar a laghad.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, who, due to Government commitments and other issues, is unavoidably absent this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Cardinal Health Incorporated announced on 7 October 2002 that it has decided to postpone its proposed investment in a new pharmaceuticals facility in Longford for up to two years due to significant changes in its business priorities following a series of corporate acquisitions in recent times. We are obviously disappointed that this important investment for the Longford area is to be deferred in the short-term. However, we are confident, following discussions with IDA Ireland, that Cardinal Health continues to be strongly committed to the expansion of its business to Ireland. We have been assured that IDA Ireland's commitment to the development of Longford remains solid and focused.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">IDA Ireland has already initiated a process in the past six months or so to enhance its business park in Longford town. The agency is also committed to the establishment of a new business and technology park for the town comprising 30 to 40 acres. I understand that both of these developments are well under way and that, with the support of the local authority, a number of potential sites have been identified for the new business park. This park will be a flagship element of local infrastructure designed to attract new investment to Longford.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Government is committed to balanced regional development and IDA Ireland has put in place a new strategy to attract greenfield investment to the BMW region, including Longford. As part of this strategy IDA Ireland has re-organised its internal structures to drive growth from within the regions. This restructuring has included an allocation of additional staff to its regional offices and an allocation of regional responsibilities to key executives in its headquarters' project divisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">IDA Ireland has transferred additional posts to Athlone comprising staff from regions, property and health care divisions, bringing the staff complement up to 35. They are located in new offices in the Garrycastle business and technology park. The underlying purpose of the strategy is to work in close partnership with those involved with other State and local resources to create a drive from within the region to pull foreign investment, rather than the current approach of pushing for it from its Dublin headquarters. Other initiatives include a greater focus on marketing of the regions for specific sectors and improvement of marketing material for the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Recent positive developments in Longford include the decision by Donnelly Electronics to establish a manufacturing operation at the former IEC Electronics facility. The company now produces a wide range of electronic displays, sensors and warning systems for the automotive sector, mainly for the export market. Currently, there are 65 people employed and this is expected to increase to approximately 160 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Enterprise Ireland is also working closely with its client companies and regional partners in developing and sustaining businesses in the area, enhancing the business environment, encouraging new start-up companies with strong growth potential and assisting Dublin based companies to locate their business expansions in the BMW region. A good example of this is Century Homes, the innovative manufacturer of timber-frame housing which commenced in Longford two years ago and which has already expanded its advance factory. The company continues to grow, as evidenced by current recruitment advertisements in the local press.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Under the Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Scheme, 2002, two approvals were made in County Longford. In this regard, Longford County Enterprise Board received €330,500 in management and capital grants and Lough Ree Area Development Society Ltd. received €13,000 in feasibility grants. Also, two new peat-powered ESB stations costing €450 million are planned for both Lanesboro and Shannonbridge. I understand that site works have already reached an advanced stage and the completion dates for both plants are October 2004 and January 2005 respectively. This investment will see ESB capacity in the two plants increase from 210 MW to 250 MW.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">Senator Bannon raised a number of key issues. He spoke of a Government agency being decentralised to Longford. As part of the Government led by former Deputy Albert Reynolds, I was pleased to be able to ensure that we decentralised a major office to Longford town. The Senator will agree that, when Mr. Reynolds was Taoiseach, Longford was certainly the centre of political opportunity in this country, from which the town has benefited.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I was pleased to serve in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which worked very closely with all the development agencies, including IDA Ireland, and I assure the Senator that the Tánaiste, the Department and IDA Ireland are very confident that Cardinal Healthcare will locate in Longford over the next two years. I am confident that the measures I outlined, which are currently being adopted by the industrial development agencies, as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development, will bring further positive results to Longford.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Senator Bannon spoke about a gas connection. If there is an industrial requirement for gas to go to Longford, and it warrants a certain quantity of gas, there will be no problem regarding BGE responding to ensure it is a commercially viable proposal. If it is commercially viable and if the requirement exists, the gas connection will be made and that will enhance opportunity for the residential sector to tap into the gas as well. However, it is not possible to take it to Longford and leave it there waiting for somebody to tap into. We must have a requirement for gas from the industrial sector to justify the huge capital investment involved. If proposals come forward, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and Bord Gáis Éireann will be only too delighted to respond to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I trust this will give Senator Bannon some comfort and he should be assured that the BMW region, including Longford, will get more than its due share of whatever opportunities are presented over the lifetime of the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_510">There is nothing new in the statement of the Minister of State.

          <p eId="para_514">The previous Government gave special status to Longford on two occasions. It was given status in terms of urban renewal, which accorded special status for development in the greater Longford area. We have given special status to the BMW region, resulting in the highest priority rating possible to create the biggest incentive to locate a company in that area. That is one of the reasons Cardinal Healthcare decided to go there.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I do not know what other status we can give, but if an imaginative proposal comes forward either from Longford County Council, Longford County Enterprise Board or some statutory body in the functional area of Longford, both the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance will give it due consideration. Special status exists and the incentives are at their maximum to attract investment to the area.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Disease Eradication Schemes.</heading>
        <speech by="#EamonScanlon" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Mr. Scanlon:</from>
          <p eId="para_516">I thank the Cathaoirleach for accepting this matter and the Minister of State for being here to reply. I want him to investigate the circumstances surrounding the disposal of TB cattle belonging to farmers from County Sligo to a meat plant in Dublin, which has subsequently gone out of business. What steps will he take to ensure that the farmers concerned are compensated for their loss?</p>
          <p eId="para_517">Since I tabled this matter on the Adjournment, I discovered that there are 191 farmers nationwide who found that they were not paid for cattle. In respect of the TB eradication scheme, the Department of Agriculture and Food licences haulage companies to take the cattle and also, under a tender process, licences the meat factories where these cattle are slaughtered. The farmers concerned have no say whatsoever in who collects their cattle or where their cattle go. Due to a problem that arose early last year under that scheme, cattle were collected from some farmers in my county and across the country and taken to a meat plant which, unfortunately, has gone into liquidation.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Some farmers have not been paid. There would be a greater outcry over the matter but for the fact that, for certain farmers, it involved only one, two or three animals. Unfortunately, a farmer in my county lost half his cattle – 18 animals – and this is a blow from which he is unable to fight back. That is why I am raising this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I understand that farmers across the country are getting together to fight this case because I and they believe that there is an obligation on the Department to honour the debt owed to them. This is because they had no say in where the cattle were taken. The amount of money involved is around £200,000. We all know what will happen if the case goes to court. Half a million euro will be spent on legal costs and, ultimately, the farmers will be paid.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Mr. Treacy:</from>
          <p eId="para_520">The disposal of reactor animals under the TB and brucellosis disease eradication schemes operates countrywide on the basis that meat factories tender on a weekly basis for the slaughter of these animals. The Department selects the meat factories on the basis of the prices that they offer for different types of animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The position in regard to the Department's schemes was that during 2001 and up to 1 April 2002, compensation for reactor animals comprised the salvage value of the animal, which was paid by the factory directly to the farmer, and a reactor grant or live valuation, less the salvage value, paid to the individual farmer by the Department. From 2 April 2002, the reactor grant regime was discontinued, when the valuation system was extended to all breakdown cases. It is important to note that, at all times, the ownership of the reactor animal continues to reside with the farmer and, therefore, the contract for the salvage value is a matter for the farmer and the meat factory involved. The Department's responsibility is solely to ensure the secure removal of the animal to slaughter and pay the appropriate reactor compensation thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">In circumstances where a factory goes out of business, such as has happened in this case, the recovery of any losses incurred by farmers is a matter for resolution between the farmers and the company's liquidators. I understand a liquidator for the meat plant concerned was appointed in November 2001. The liquidation process is continuing and I am informed will not be concluded for some time. While no decision to compensate any of the farmers concerned has been taken, I am advised that to make such a decision at this stage would be wholly inappropriate from a legal point of view and any such decision should not be considered until the liquidation process has been concluded. While I have the utmost sympathy for those farmers who have suffered losses as a result of the closure of the plant, nevertheless, as I stated, the recovery of such losses is a matter for resolution with the liquidator and legally, even if we wanted to intervene, we are precluded from doing so at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I am pleased to note from the Senator that the farmers are getting together. They should do so and appoint a lawyer, and perhaps an accountant, to represent them and negotiate with the liquidator. On that basis they will all get equitable treatment on the residue available to the liquidator once he has disposed of the borrowings or other debt owed on the premises or the trading company. It is important that they be represented as a group because if farmers take an isolated approach, it will cost them money and their chance of getting an equitable settlement may be remote. If the Senator is able to provide us with a list of the names and addresses of those involved, we will keep them in mind in the Department's handling of this file.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Beef Industry.</heading>
        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Mr. Leyden:</from>
          <p eId="para_524">I thank you, Sir, for selecting this Adjournment matter because it is very important that we address the difficulties in the beef industry. Protests are taking place outside many factories. In County Roscommon protests are under way this week outside the Kepak factory in Athleague. There should be a full examination of the relationship between the beef processing industry, farmers and the providers of stock. The protests have not received much attention because of the Nice treaty referendum campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The European farming industry has suffered in recent years. The BSE crisis and foot and mouth disease outbreak were the main causes of the hardship. While matters appear to have improved on the Continent, Irish farmers continue to be quoted low prices for their beef by the beef processing industry. Recent market trends appear to suggest that the price of beef should be rising. The UK market is very active and across Europe cattle prices have increased by €40 per head since July and demand for Irish beef has been very strong.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The recent lifting of the six county Russian ban provides market access for an additional 36% of our live cattle, although, because it is a very difficult market, this opportunity is not being fully exploited. The Egyptian market is not providing good access whereas at one time it took 100,000 tonnes of Irish beef. The price of approximately 81p per lb for quality stock is exceptionally low and not viable. The Minister of State is very conscious of prices, knows the business well and will be concerned about this trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I also appreciate that processors are facing tough margins. The prices paid by the factories this September are 13% lower than those quoted in September 2000. It appears that the only response for the meat factories following the positive news of the lifting of the Russian ban was to cut prices again. In fact, prices have fallen by €95 per annum since July and, at least according to the IFA, only for the farmers' protest the factories would have dropped prices further. These price cuts have left Irish farmers in the position where Irish beef prices are the second lowest in Europe and where prices quoted across all factories and processors in Ireland are, coincidentally, identical.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">It is clear that the beef processing sector continues to be dominated by a number of key players and that proposed reform may further tighten their control. While there are reports of no cartels within the industry, the end result is the same for farmers. I spoke to some factory owners today and they assured me that there are no cartels. I call on the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address this issue and again direct the Competition Authority to investigate the alleged anti-competitive pricing structure within the beef industry. It is clear that efforts to improve the position of farmers in recent years have failed.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The IFA has organised protests outside the factories. I spoke to its president, John Dillon, last Wednesday. The IFA should debate the issues within its organisation, not in public. It should make contact with the Government and processors. This should be a co-operative movement in terms of the issues affecting farmers. I do not believe in confrontation, there should be consultation. The IFA relies on the industry to provide an income through the levy system which we, as farmers, are providing. It faces a conflict where it is protesting about prices, yet it collects a levy when beef goes through. For example, the price quoted on organic food is approximately 110p per lb, which is acceptable and indicative of a competitive business.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The industry tells me it has no concerns about showing its books to the Competition Authority. It would allay the fears of the IFA and producers if an independent organisation, such as the authority, was prepared to examine the books of the industry to ensure there is genuine competition between the factories involved. We in County Roscommon are fortunate in having processing plants in Athleague, Roosky and Ballaghaderreen. They have provided good employment and an excellent service for farmers. The Kepak plant in Athleague is in my parish. It brought about a revolution in the business where farmers are paid on the day, unlike the situation outlined by Senator Scanlon, where farmers are owed money. It is one big benefit that accrued following the impact of Noel Keating and the Kepak organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">I live on a farm and work with the farmers in my area. They are deeply concerned. Unless prices increase they will not be there in the future. Processors will be affected because, without the raw material, there will not be a processing industry. That is the reason I appeal to the industry and the IFA to try to negotiate a viable price for a quality product. As my party's former spokesperson on agriculture in this House, Sir, you know we have the best beef in this country. We need to see a fair price being given to producers.</p>

          <from>Mr. Treacy:</from>
          <p eId="para_532">The current events in the beef industry began as a protest three weeks ago and were originally confined to farmers protesting at AIBP owned plants, which were prevented from sorting cattle on Monday, 23 September. The protest has been extended to the point that five plants, accounting for 20% of the national slaughtering capacity, are disrupted by the dispute. I understand the protest was sparked by a fall in prices following the lifting in the middle of September of the Russian BSE related ban on six counties with a relatively high level of BSE. This ban had been causing logistical problems for the meat plants and farmers expected prices to increase following its removal.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The issue of cattle prices is a matter for direct negotiation between beef producers and beef processors and it would be inappropriate for me or any other Minister to intervene in the current dispute. This area is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Food. The function of the Government, through the Minister, in relation to cattle prices is to set the policy parameters and support framework and seek by every political and diplomatic initiative to secure access to markets. The Minister is discharging these functions and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I joined the Department as Minister of State last June. The Minister and the staff at the highest level are totally committed to taking every possible diplomatic and official initiative to ensure we can market beef and dairy products out of the country. The market for cheap meat is buoyant. We have had the highest level of representation across the world. There has been tremendous support from the worldwide diplomatic staff and the Minister has led and met delegations pertaining to all of these issues, including the holding of a five hour meeting on 11 September with the IFA.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The Government is concerned that the dispute could lead to a build-up of cattle and disrupt supplies to our major markets, which would not be in the interests of producers or processors. In view of this, I and the Minister for Agriculture and Food have called on both sides to seek to find a solution to the dispute through the well-established lines of communication which exist between farmers and processors.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for competition policy. The Competition Authority is the independent enforcement agency for competition policy. Its remit extends to all areas of the economy and it has powers to investigate all breaches of competition law by virtue of section 30(1) of the Competition Act, 2002, which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_537">To carry out an investigation, either on its own initiative or in response to a complaint made to it by any person, into any breach of this Act that may be occurring or has occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">In relation to cartel-type offences, the key feature of the Competition Act is that it prohibits agreements between undertakings that have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition. It is therefore necessary to prove that members of a cartel in some way got together to fix prices or markets. Price similarity or price shadowing is not at all conclusive as it may also be characteristic of highly competitive markets and I think that would be the case in our beef industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">In this area the Competition Authority is absolutely independent in its functions. The matter of beef prices and allegations that there is anti-competitive activity has been investigated before and no hard evidence was produced. Consequently, it is not the intention of the Government to order a re-investigation. The Senators may remember that, when the last stand-off occurred between the farming organisations and the beef processors, we set up a group of three wise men, a powerful committee of eminent former public servants and eminent serving public servants, which produced a wide-ranging report that has been published. Its conclusion was that there was no cartel in the industry at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">To deal with anti-competitive activity one needs evidence which can be used in court, which is the final arbiter in deciding whether the Competition Act has been breached. There are two alternative ways in which action can be taken. Any evidence of price fixing should be passed to the Competition Authority and those with allegations to make should use the public enforcement system via the Competition Authority. Equally, section 14 of the Competition Act, 2002, provides that any person aggrieved in consequence of anti-competition activity has a right of action in the courts for relief by way of injunction or declaration and damages, including exemplary damages. One must first of all make an allegation which must be substantiated and in written form with documentary back-up. If the Competition Authority finds in one's favour, one can go to the courts for relief and as a result of the competitive distortion, the courts may award damages.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">In early 2000, arising from a dispute which was taking place at the time between the IFA and meat processors, an independent group was established to report on allegations of anti-competitive practices in the beef industry. Among its findings – I have already alluded to this – the group found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour, either in the pattern of cattle prices or in profits. On the contrary, there was evidence from the various sources consulted that on average the industry is one of low profitability. There may be a problem with the attitude of management in the IMA in that it can make the same profits with low slaughtering volumes as it can with large slaughtering volumes. This could be part of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The Competition Authority previously conducted an investigation over a number of years into the meat processing industry and particularly into allegations of the existence of a price-fixing cartel among meat processors. Following its investigation the authority was unable to find sufficient evidence to support these allegations so could not take any action under the Competition Act. While previous investigations of anti-competitive behaviour did not result in evidence to support those allegations, the authority is always open to recommence an investigation should any new information come to its attention that would warrant such a step. In that regard, as with all allegations of anti-competitive behaviour, the authority encourages complainants to provide it with as much information and evidence as possible to assist it with its investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I reiterate the authority's encouragement of complainants as it is only by acting on hard evidence that the authority can make progress in rooting out anti-competitive activity which has such negative effects on both the industry and consumers. As stated previously, the authority has responsibility for the enforcement of competition in all areas of our economy. Its remit requires it to be vigilant as to breaches of the Competition Act. Senators can be assured that it is monitoring developments in all sectors. In the absence of competition law being breached, this matter is one for the parties themselves to resolve.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I spoke at the beef quality awards last Monday week in front of the IMA and the farming organisations and I appealed to the Irish Meat Association and to the farming organisations to sit down together to look at the issue of capacity and the primary producers entitlement to the best price possible and to take into account the huge effort being made by the Department of Agriculture and Food along with the State agencies including Bord Bia. We will be at the SIAL food fair next week marketing Irish food produce to the people of France and Europe. I ask them to sit down and see how they can find a resolution to the current impasse so that the primary producer can get ample reward for producing quality beef in one of the most natural environments in the world. I hope that common sense will prevail sooner rather than later, that the markets will be allowed to proceed and that the producers get the proper price.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden:</from>
          <p eId="para_545">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for his very comprehensive response to the issues I raised. I am encouraged by his appeal to bring all parties together to resolve this issue as quickly as possible because it is damaging our industry and our exports. I hope the Minister of State continues his efforts along with the Minister for Agriculture and Food to bring all the interested parties to the table.</p>
