          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I wish to return to the problem arising from the total recall of bacon products which has become an unmitigated disaster.  Pig farmers and processors are not to blame for this crisis.  It has happened because an illegal substance found its way into the human food chain from a facility licensed by the State.  The Government decided on Saturday on a total recall of product.  There is no back-up plan to give effect to that decision.  When an emergency plan kicks in for a local authority the various State agencies know what they must do.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">In this case processors are not back at work, 6,000 workers are on protective notice and housewives all over the country are faced with imported bacon from Denmark, Holland and Great Britain in retail outlets.  There are no Irish bacon products on sale two weeks before Christmas.  The situation is well known to the Taoiseach.  He knows the scale and extent of the problem but the Government has not made a decision that would allow processors to return to work in their factories.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">There were 16 hours of talk yesterday and some progress was made.  I would like the Taoiseach to tell the House this morning, in the interest of housewives who want to stock up this weekend or next week, workers who are on protective notice and the dole, processors who are not the cause of this problem being able to put their plants back in operation and pig farmers whose stock is ready for entry to the processing plants what will be decided.  If the Government knows the scale of the problem why has it not made a decision and given processors the opportunity to return to work, with or without European assistance?</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The Taoiseach said yesterday that this was not ruled out by Europe; I understood it was.  I would like the Taoiseach to tell us the consequence of the plan he has put in place and what decision has been made on allowing processors back to work, bringing the industry back into operation and allowing Irish products to be on Irish and foreign shelves this weekend.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_6">Discussions between the Government and the Irish pig processing sector adjourned early this morning and resumed at 10 o'clock this morning.  Progress was made during the discussion and I remain confident of achieving an outcome which will facilitate the early resumption of processing.  There is no lack of urgency on the part of the Government; it is acutely aware of the impact the suspension of slaughtering has had on hundreds of producers throughout the country and thousands of workers whose jobs have been compromised by recent events.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, is centrally involved in the discussions and I am available at all times to assist in every way I can.  Everyone has an interest in the resumption of slaughtering.  Producers have thousands of animals ready for slaughter this week and processors have domestic and international markets to fill.  The Government wants to see this significant sector operating at full capacity and the thousands of jobs in the sector secured.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The discussions have considered a number of possible approaches to provide support for the sector.  The involvement of the Minister and I is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to achieving a solution and is recognition of the value of the sector.  We are conscious of the importance of the pig sector to the Irish agrifood industry and its contribution to the wider economy.  Our priority is for processing to resume as a matter of urgency.  If agreement on an aid package is reached slaughtering could recommence shortly thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The European Food Safety Authority is preparing its scientific assessment of the risks to human health of the possible presence of dioxins in pigmeat and pigmeat products from Ireland.  It will also evaluate any risks posed by the presence of contaminated pigmeat products from Ireland in composite foods.  We expect this assessment to be published today.  It will provide a great degree of clarity on the secondary processing sector.  The question of liabilities arising there is something that is central to what we are trying to achieve in the urgent ongoing discussions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_14">I welcome the announcement that there will be a report from Europe today on secondary processing.  The Taoiseach's response does not deal with the primary problem.  He pressed the crisis button, decided on a total recall and has no plan to back it up.  Can he tell the arrangements for the transport of product in retail outlets and supermarkets?  What are the transport arrangements for product from processors?  What are the arrangements for rendering this product?  What transport and rendering arrangements have been made for products in retail outlets and processing units abroad?  What decision has been made about organic pig producers who never use meal and are entirely separate from this?</p>
          <p eId="para_15">If money is a problem — I understand there is a gap in the discussions between the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Government — they know what the problem is.  Money will be received from Europe or it will not; it has no legal basis.  There was no assistance given in the Belgian case a number of years ago.  Whether that applies or not the system has ground to a halt because processors are unable to process product.  That can only be started if they deal with the financial pressure caused by disposal, rendition, cost, transport and the opportunity to get back to work.  There are 6,000 people employed in the processing industry, 2,000 of whom are on protective notice or on the dole.  Housewives all over the country want to buy Irish produce, but every supermarket contains only Danish, Dutch and British bacon for sale.  Sows will not wait because nature takes its course, so they have got to get into these processing plants.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">What decision has the Government made on the big picture?  I do not want us to get locked down on details.  The Government should have been able to press a crisis button on Saturday and have a clear plan to deal with the consequences.  That is not happening, following 16 hours of talks last night.  I hope that this is sorted out by lunchtime today.  If the Taoiseach and his Ministers want to see this production line in operation, then he should make the decision to ensure that it happens.  He has the authority, the opportunity and the scope to do that, whether or not he gets any assistance from Europe.  This crisis erupted because an illegal product found its way into the human food chain from a facility licensed by this State.  The problem was not caused by farmers, processors or consumers.  These groups want to see the production of high quality products, of which we have always been proud.  However, the Government is responsible for the current delays in the system, under the polluter pays principle.  We need to have that rectified and the Government is the agent in place to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to set out the Government's overriding ambition?  We want to see processing plants operating to full capacity.  If the Minister so directs, that can happen today and those workers on protective notice can get back to work.  Hundreds of thousands of consumers can then buy Irish pork products and An Bord Bia can lay out its strategy for the restoration of consumer confidence in this product at home and abroad.  The Taoiseach needs to take decisive action quickly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_42">Last Monday, 37 cases were brought by banks and building societies for the repossession of homes.  If there were 37 cases before the courts, it is fair to assume that several hundred homes have been repossessed without having to go to court.  Meanwhile, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published a report yesterday showing that the number of people on council housing waiting lists has increased by 30% to 60,000.  This increase occurred in the three years up until March 2008, which is the time before the major job losses occurred.  These were the three best years for house building in Ireland, when one would have expected a significant return of houses under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">This is probably the biggest social ticking time bomb in this country.  If 2008 was the year that saw 100,000 people lose their jobs, then 2009 is shaping up to be the year when people's homes are repossessed.  There is already evidence of cases being brought by building societies to put people out of their homes.  It does not have to be like that.  There are ways in which arrangements can be made so that for the duration of the recession, people can at least stay in their own homes.  The biggest fear people have — bigger than the fear of losing their jobs — is of losing their homes.  It is crazy.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">Banks and building societies are repossessing homes they cannot sell in this market.  If a bank manages to sell a house, it will not recoup the amount of money the house was bought for.  When a house is repossessed, the family concerned ends up on a council housing list.  It will have to be allocated a house by a local authority at some stage, or paid rent allowance to rent a home somewhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Will the Government come up with an approach to ensure that people can continue to live in their own homes while they are getting through the two, three or four difficult years that are ahead of us?  Those whose homes are being repossessed now will be back on their feet again within a couple of years.  All that is required is an arrangement whereby one's mortgage can be suspended and rent allowance can be applied to the home one is living in.  Perhaps the rules of the mortgage interest subsidy scheme, which have not been changed for some time, can be revisited.  It may be possible to apply shared equity through local authorities.  Arrangements need to be put in place, through the State or lending agencies, to assure people that they can stay living in their own homes.  It looks likely that a slew of people will be taken to court in 2009 to have their homes repossessed.  We need to ensure that people are not put out of their homes, as that would require the State to pay them to live somewhere else, in effect.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_33">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_46">The Government is proactively seeking to safeguard the interests of households that are experiencing difficulties in making mortgage payments as a result of circumstances beyond their control.  Our priority is to ensure, as much as possible, that mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings seeking home repossession.  The Government has insisted that banks participating in the guarantee scheme confirm their compliance with the Irish Banking Federation's code of practice on mortgage arrears.  That detailed and robust code has been operated successfully by banks in Ireland since 2000 on a voluntary basis.  The primary purpose of the code is to take every possible step to avoid recourse to repossession proceedings.  The code states clearly that in normal circumstances, the lender will not seek repossession of a property until every reasonable step to agree an alternative repayment schedule has been exhausted.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">The Deputy spoke about the need to modify repayment schedules to meet new circumstances.  I remind him that approximately 7,000 people avail of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  Some 70,000 people are catered for under the rent supplement scheme.  The banks are bound by the federation's code of practice, which I have mentioned.  Approximately 50 houses were repossessed by mainstream lenders in 2007.  More recent statistics on court proceedings involving house repossessions indicate, as the Deputy suggested, that there has been an increase in the number of repossession applications to the courts.  Most applications are being made by sub-prime lenders, rather than mainstream banks that have adopted the code of practice on mortgage arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">I am concerned about the extent to which some non-mainstream lenders are having recourse to the courts and seeking orders for house repossessions.  It is important for the Financial Regulator to urgently explore with such lenders, in the context of the implementation of the requirements of the consumer protection code, the steps that are needed to minimise court interventions that are ultimately not in the interests of lenders or borrowers.  There is a strong case for extending the code of practice on mortgage arrears to the small number of mortgage lenders that are not subject to it at present.  I will ask the Minister of State with responsibility for housing to take that matter up as a matter of urgency.  The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which has 53 local offices, continues to advise and work with clients on the restructuring of payments.  That local resource is open to everyone.  I have made the points I wanted to make in response to Deputy Gilmore's question about the repossession schedule.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_49">With respect, the Taoiseach has given us a commentary on what is happening.  The codes of practice to which the Taoiseach referred were drawn up during normal times.  These are not normal times.  Many people have lost their jobs over the last year.  Many more people are facing the prospect of losing their jobs or their businesses.  They are stuck with mortgages that, in many cases, they cannot afford to pay.  The mortgage subsidy scheme needs to be updated.  Under the present rules, if one half of a couple is working 30 hours a week, and possibly earning a very low income, the couple is not entitled to the mortgage subsidy.  That needs to be revised.  There is a certain irony in the Taoiseach's suggestion that people go to the 53 Money Advice and Budgeting Service offices throughout the country.  Does he not recall the announcement by the Minister for Finance on budget day that the service is to be absorbed into the community information centres?  The Government has decided to rationalise an agency that needs to be accessed by people who are in trouble.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_53">I am not asking the Taoiseach to ask the banks and building societies to change their codes of practice.  On behalf of the Government, he should take action.  A scheme to give families a guarantee that they will not lose their homes needs to be brought before the House by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  There is no point in telling families that they should take their chances in court.  Such people often end up spending more money on legal fees, to defend court actions for repossession being taken against them by building societies like Start Mortgages, than the amount of the arrears on their mortgages.  This real problem is beginning to surface in the courts.  There is evidence to suggest that many of these cases are backing up.  We will see many more of them in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">The Government should not be required next year to take emergency action to deal with this problem, which is staring it in the face.  It can take action now to prevent the pain that families would have to endure if attempts were made to repossess their homes in 2009.  The Government should change its housing policies, the mortgage subsidy arrangements and the rent allowance regime.  It should enter into an arrangement with the banks, to which it has provided a guarantee, to ensure that the mortgages of people who find themselves in trouble can be suspended for two or three years while such people get back on their feet.  Such an arrangement would make economic sense for the State, the lending agencies and the families concerned.  The Government should take action now.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach appears to be suggesting, it is not merely a question of encouraging the lending agencies and pointing those who are in trouble in the direction of the offices of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.  Many such offices are likely to be closed some time next year anyway.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_39">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_55">The Deputy was making some good points, but he concluded with a facetious comment.  The fact is that the common management of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service will remain in place.  Front line services will not be affected in any way.  I did not suggest that the service represents a panacea in this instance.  It is important to make people aware that an objective service is available to help them.  My own knowledge of these matters indicates that many people are being assisted by the service on a daily basis.  People in certain circumstances are getting very good mortgage deals with lending institutions.  The Deputy should not be facetious.  The service has a role to play.  It is playing that role.  It does not cover all of the issues.  As a local resource, it is providing practical answers to people in an accessible and speedy way.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">I have indicated that the Financial Regulator has been instructed to consider whether the consumer protection code, which has been in place since 2000, can be extended to lenders in the sub-prime sector who are going to the courts to seek repossession orders as a first resort, rather than as a last resort.  It is clear that when insecurity arises in respect of people's job prospects, they discuss such matters with banks at their own initiative.  Banks are having to make suitable arrangements to ensure people can repay their mortgages.  As I have said, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is examining all issues to determine how the Government, in addition to offering the protections that are already in place, can be of assistance in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">On changing housing policies, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing has been quite innovative in trying to increase the options available for those who wish to access social and affordable housing.  Regarding building, I understand 14,500 households in need of social housing had their needs met last year alone, which is important.  I also recognise that up to 45% of those on waiting lists are single-adult households.  There are also people from our immigrant community who require housing, which is a new factor and component behind the growth in some of these categories.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Despite the difficulties in the finances, more than €1.5 billion of Exchequer funding is being provided this year to ensure that we support social housing activity in 2008, which will provide more than 9,000 new dwellings in the course of this year.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing has also introduced changes to roll out further the rental accommodation scheme, meeting the needs of households currently in receipt of long-term rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  He has been very proactive with homeless groups in trying to deal with the long waiting lists in that area through a far better interaction between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities in getting people into homes.  I believe the initiative he will start at the beginning of next year will produce some important results in that area.  He has also provided for a long-term leasing arrangement for local authorities, whereby vacant houses on the market at present can be obtained by local authorities and provided for long-term lease.</p>

            <p eId="para_69">At its sixth plenary meeting last February, the North-South Ministerial Council noted the completion of the Government's consultation with the social partners on the subject of the North-South consultative forum and noted the position regarding the review of the civic forum in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_70">Discussions with the social partners and various cross-Border and North-South groups on the consultative forum were completed earlier this year.  A paper has been prepared setting out the Government's proposals relating to the role, format, membership and operation of a forum, which has been provided to the Northern Ireland Executive in advance of the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, now scheduled for 23 January 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_72">I understand the North-South consultative forum was to be drawn from civic society and have social partners and so on involved in it.  Will that ever happen?  It is now ten years since the Good Friday Agreement and not very much seems to be happening to establish this body.  I note that the last meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council was held in February and the next one is scheduled for January.  Is it sufficient that North-South Ministerial Council effectively meets just once a year?  What progress, if any, is being made on the establishment of the North-South parliamentary body which was also to be established under the Good Friday Agreement?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_49">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_73">On the first matter, I agree that I would have rather seen the civic forum established far sooner.  It requires political sponsorship and support.  As the Deputy knows, we have been working through the North-South Ministerial Council in an effort to carry out whatever preparations people wanted in order to establish the scope of the issues.  This is not an area of activity like social partnership that has developed in the Republic.  This is not a feature of public life in Northern Ireland as it has become here in terms of how we operate and how we give a greater deal of participation to various groups in respect of policy formulation like the National Economic and Social Forum, the National Economic and Social Council and other such representative bodies that get a very broad breadth of opinion into the area of public policy issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_74">Going back as far as the time when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs and up to today, I would have liked to have seen the civic forum established far sooner.  I believe it has a contribution to make.  It is a confidence building measure and it would also emphasise the many problems that are best solved in common rather than separately and from which we can learn best practice in a range of areas.  It is meant to comprise representatives of the business, trade union and voluntary sectors, and such other sectors as agreed by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.  As the Deputy will be aware, that office has taken some time to bed in particularly following the changeover since the retirement of Dr. Paisley.  I am glad to say that hiatus period now seems to be behind us, when many issues were not being dealt with and the Executive was not even meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">The Deputy also asked me whether I accept that once a year is sufficient for meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council and the answer is "No"; I do not.  Obviously there are many ministerial meetings that occur bilaterally within the various Departments, involving Ministers with responsibility for education, health, local development and so forth.  They also involve the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  There was this hiatus period of which we are all aware, which would have been a reason for not holding a North-South Ministerial Council meeting in the second half of 2008.  It is now agreed that this will take place on 23 January 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">The Deputy also asked me about the North-South parliamentary body.  I understand that the Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Ceann Comhairle have begun a process which gives some momentum to that issue and we hope that under the respective leadership of Mr. Hay and the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy John O'Donoghue, we can see the establishment of that committee far sooner than would otherwise have been the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">I thank the Taoiseach for the response.  If there is foot-dragging in getting the civic body established formally, is there any way to build upon the existing North-South contact, dialogue and arrangements across a range of areas of life on the island?  For example some sporting bodies like the IRFU and GAA are all-island bodies anyway and the same is true of churches.  There seems to be increased contact in any event across a range of areas of life, including business, tourism and farming.  Many organisations, North and South, have considerable contact with each other anyway.  That seems to be growing, which is very welcome.  Is there some way in which the growing contact between bodies, organisations and interests North and South, which is evolving anyway, can be built upon and supported?  If there is a problem in establishing the civic forum as an institution, from the top down, might there be a way of encouraging, shaping and supporting it from the ground up?  That would build on what is, in any event, developing organically.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_51">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_78">I agree with the Deputy.  Historically, much of the leadership in the area of contact and working together has been in sporting and other voluntary organisations which have always ensured, to the greatest extent possible, that politics has not been allowed to hinder or in any way separate contact between people who have common interests, whether these be sporting, recreational, cultural or any other.  In terms of democratic authority, quite rightly the emphasis has been on the need for parties to come to a <i>rapprochement </i>on how to govern the island, North and South, in a way that was conducive to peace, prosperity and stability.  However, without doubt there have been ongoing contacts where very good relationships have built up within organisations, North and South.  They helped greatly to dismiss many of the myths, misunderstandings and shibboleths that grew up during an era of misunderstanding and lack of contact, prior to those organisations filling that void.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">With regard to the civic forum, let us remind ourselves that a consultative civic forum was established in Northern Ireland which comprised business, trade unions and voluntary sectors.  Having established a civic forum, and despite good progress in discussions, the North-South consultative aspect of the Good Friday Agreement in this respect had not been established when the political institutions were suspended in 2002.  We are trying to regain momentum in the aftermath of the St. Andrews Agreement of 2006 to support the establishment of an independent, North-South consultative forum appointed by the two administrations and representative of civil society.  It would include and build on the very solid foundations the Deputy adverted to in his question.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">The Deputy asked about the future of the civic forum.  The present technical position is that it is being reviewed by the new Northern Ireland Executive.  The matter was discussed by the two administrations at their meeting in July 2007.  The meeting noted that the Irish Government was anxious to proceed and was consulting with social partners and that, when it was completed, the review of arrangements for consulting civic society in Northern Ireland should allow the parties to consider the question.  I hope that review is near completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">We have held consultations with social partners, as we indicated we would.  We are also seeking the views of cross-Border, North-South and other interested bodies and organisations.  This has been kicking around the House for some time.  Everybody knows what its shape, intent, purpose and benefit would be.  Its implementation requires some political will to emanate from the Northern Ireland Executive and from the joint offices of the First and Deputy First Ministers.  I trust that their resumed relationship will be fruitful in this respect as it must be in others.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">We all welcome the recent progress in the agreement reached between Sinn Féin and the DUP.  One hopes this will bring about the devolution of policing and justice powers from London to Belfast, and that other outstanding matters will be addressed appropriately and soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">We all want to see the Executive and the All-Ireland Ministerial Council functioning in full.  Would the Taoiseach accept that responsibility for an all-Ireland consultative forum does not lie only with the Executive and the Assembly?  Does he accept that this forum is one of a number of key outstanding and long overdue elements of the Good Friday Agreement, which is now over ten years in being?  There is great concern that this integral part of the Agreement, as endorsed by the popular vote of the people, has not yet been progressed in any real and substantive way.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">There are other elements.  I acknowledge the Taoiseach's point with regard to the all-Ireland parliamentary forum.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his recent correspondence in respect of that matter and I acknowledge the corresponding initiative being taken by his counterpart in the Assembly, Willie Hay MLA.  Apart from the all-Ireland parliamentary forum there is the matter of the charter of rights.  Will the Taoiseach accept there has been minimal movement towards the introduction of a charter of rights, and that this is also an issue that requires greater urgency and proactive address?</p>
            <p eId="para_85">The Taoiseach made a point to Deputy Gilmore in respect of confidence building measures.  I wonder whether the Government really appreciates the importance of the civic forum.  Does the Taoiseach accept that what we are talking about here is, first, the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Good Friday Agreement?  Such a forum has the endorsement not only of the Executive but of both the British and Irish Governments.  It would help bring broad elements of civic society together across this island for the very first time.  Does the Taoiseach realise this would be of special relevance to non-State organisations, NGOs, the voluntary and community sector, trade unions and others?  There is a long list of organisations that would be keen to participate in such a forum.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that some of these organisations are organised on an all-Ireland basis already?  Many are not, and it is of greatest concern that they are not currently exposed to cross-island engagement or interaction.  The civic forum would offer such an opportunity.  Does the Taoiseach agree that helping to break down these barriers and combating partitionism, in the sense of a thought process, would be patently in the interests of all opinion on the island of Ireland?  I shall give a practical example where I believe that such an engagement would have a practical result.  We are not talking here only of confidence building.  I speak of the merry-go-round that currently exists with regard to cross-Border shopping.  The Taoiseach's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is as exposed to the reality of this as I am.  On one day one sees the drove going in one direction and on another it comes the other way.  There must be engagement and a realisation of the benefits for all that would come through, for instance, tax harmonisation and a common currency across the island.  These critical debates must begin.  The civic forum is just such an entity that would accommodate a real and substantive address of these very real problems that present on one side of the Border or another at different times.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that every urgency will be employed in bringing forward, and to fruition, the establishment of the civic forum?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_53">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_87">I agree the civic forum should be set up as soon as possible.  I believe also that if it is to have the beneficial effect it could have we must accord to it the importance and capacity it can have, rather than a greater capacity.  For example, the Deputy mentioned the question of a common currency.  Any and every matter can certainly be discussed in a civic forum but these are major political issues and can only be dealt with by governments, rather than in the Northern Ireland Executive construct.  These would be very significant matters.  In our effort to explore and exploit the full potential of these institutions we should not burden them with a level of expectation they cannot meet.  I make that cautionary point not to take away in any way from one's enthusiastic endorsement of a civic forum and the potential it would provide for engagement in a non-contentious way.  It should not be seen as an empty formula for discussion but, as the Deputy said, as offering a real participation by wider society in public policy issues that will cement the benefits of the Agreement in all its aspects.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">The fact that technically we are awaiting a review from the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on this matter is an indication that we need to move it from there in order to bring it to a successful conclusion.  This is not in any way a criticism of the office.  I am making the point that a good political relationship is necessary, not only between the parties and the Administration but also between the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, who need to work closely on these matters and show a capacity to move them on.  This is the best way we can assist in making this happen as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">I do not believe there is any disagreement in the House about the necessity of establishing the forum as quickly as possible, the potential it has, or the need to develop social partnership on an all-island basis.  This would also be of great benefit to the political culture, because social participation and partnership, in the context of policy, are about concentrating on solving problems, finding pragmatic solutions and taking other perspectives into account, whether those of the trade union movement, employers, farmers, voluntary organisations or political parties.  We have seen the benefit of this.  Social partnership raises a challenge in difficult times as well as being an excellent framework in good times.  The fact that we have seen its benefits and developed it in all its aspects, rather than simply in a narrow economic or political way, gives me confidence that even in terms of the challenges we face in the Republic, social partnership remains the best means to find a way forward.  People must see a viable way forward, and they must be prepared not to avoid solving the problem but to solve it in a way that can be supported by everybody who is affected.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">Would the Taoiseach accept that while the examples I gave were bold in terms of using a civic forum as a means of address, and realising that it would be the political entities that would ultimately make those changes, in the absence of any evidence of serious address of issues such as that of a common currency across the island of Ireland or tax harmonisation in the area of VAT, the making of such calls by an all-island civic forum would be a major impetus to the realisation of these important changes?  Would he not accept that they could end up being the drivers of change?  Our political voices, North and South, may be a little slower to tackle the fundamental changes that are necessary to have a positive impact on the daily living conditions of ordinary people throughout this island.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">In the Taoiseach's response he acknowledged that it is his and the Government's intention to press ahead even after the many years that have gone by.  Can he indicate what further steps he now proposes to take to bring about the establishment of the all-Ireland civic forum?  For example, can he advise us whether he and the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, have directly addressed this matter or whether it is on the agenda for his next meeting with the Prime Minister?  Will both Governments act in concert to help bring about the progress necessary to establish the all-Ireland civic forum?</p>
            <p eId="para_92">In the course of the Taoiseach's responses he indicated having engaged with the social partners.  Can he tell us what the response of the social partners has been in the discussions with him?  Can he indicate whether parallel engagement with the social partners north of the Border in the Six Counties has also taken place, and what knowledge he has of the responses received there on this matter?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_55">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_93">The establishment of the North-South forum is a strand 2 matter, which is a matter between the Executive and the Government.  The British Government has no problem with its establishment, but the mechanics of establishing it require consent and agreement on the structure by the Executive and this Administration, and we would like to proceed with that quickly.  A review is currently taking place within the joint office on a civic forum in Northern Ireland, and this should inform our progress.  As soon as the review is completed we will get on with it.  That is what we want to do.  These are the procedures that are in place and the decisions that have been taken in order to make progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_94">As Deputy Ó Caoláin said, the forum has been in gestation far longer than any of us would have contemplated ten years ago.  The Deputy's point is taken.  We will need everyone to buy into the process.  It is not true that in every aspect of political culture in Ireland this is seen as an important contribution to the public life of the country.  We think so, the Deputy thinks so, and others are gradually coming to the view that it is a good thing that has benefits.  In order to bring along other people who are not as enthusiastic as we are, we need to ensure the work of the forum is incremental.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">I do not want to take away from the Deputy's view on the matter, but to bring common currency issues to the forum as a main topic of discussion would be more negative than positive in terms of momentum because in the view of others it is beyond the remit of the forum at this time.  I am not closing off the possibility of discussion or of people having views, but I am making the point that we need to have a clear view of what it can achieve in the medium term.  The question of a common currency is a huge issue, as the Deputy can see.  How to have a common currency in two different jurisdictions is a major challenge.  While one can see the benefits of such a decision from a certain perspective, one must also recognise that such a decision lies elsewhere in terms of having an all-Ireland application.  Certainly one would have a lot of persuading to do to make it happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">Let us get on with the work the forum can do and should be doing to reinforce the common approaches and perspectives which will, in time, change the culture and the nature of the relationship between North and South.  That is the benefit it can really bring, it can open up new perspectives.  It is not a matter of "open minds as open as a trap", as Séamus Heaney has said.  We must all be genuinely open to the possibility of reconfiguring that relationship in the 21st century.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_97">Has the Taoiseach had discussions with the Unionist parties in the North about their participation in the consultative forum?  Can they identify what is the actual blockage that is preventing the setting up of the forum, which I would support?  Following on from the Taoiseach's comments about currency, which is of course a matter for governments, and stepping back a little, does he see the possibility of the consultative forum making recommendations in other areas, such as health?  Both Governments missed a great opportunity, in the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement and since then, to deal with cross-Border, all-island health issues.  I refer to the possibility of relationships between Altnagelvin and Letterkenny hospitals or Enniskillen and Sligo hospitals for cancer treatment, cardiac treatment or anything else.  There appears to be a missed opportunity there.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">Would the Taoiseach agree that if the consultative forum were to discuss issues such as this, it might lead to agreement between both Governments that it is a small island and that specialist facilities in certain areas could be provided on a cross-Border basis?  There could be one in Altnagelvin and one in Letterkenny, for example.  Does the Taoiseach see the consultative forum as having a possible impact in terms of leading the Governments to make decisions in such areas, which would be to the benefit of people North and South and communities on all sides?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_57">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_99">The answer is "Yes".  Such practical co-operation is precisely the sort of thing to which a forum could lend inter-community support.  The idea of the civic forum is to articulate support from within the communities for these type of initiatives and to stretch policy makers in making responses commensurate with the articulated aspirations.  This is precisely the value of a civic forum with a structured dialogue of that nature.</p>
            <p eId="para_100">Even prior to the Good Friday Agreement, there was a lot of practical co-operation in the health area among others.  I refer to the CAWT initiative between the three health board regions in the north east and north west and the health authorities on the other side of the Border, which has enabled people to look at practical arrangements for dialysis treatments.  People from County Louth and the Cooley peninsula attend the hospital in Newry.  I have visited there in the past with Séamus Mallon and seen the practical aspects of that co-operation and how we use taxpayers' funds to greater effect by co-operating and avoiding duplication of services in natural hinterlands across the Border area and across the island in the case of more specialised tertiary treatments.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">These are obvious areas which would have the full support of everybody in the community.  I refer to Science Foundation Ireland in the area of education, where collaboration between universities North and South is not only promoted but in some cases is a criterion for accessing money and research funding in order to ensure the best possible outcome for taxpayers' commitments in these areas.  There is a plethora of areas of co-operation which have only been touched upon.  We need the confidence in the political system to get on with that agenda which is neither surreptitious nor conspiratorial, nor acquisitive but is simply concerned with sensible arrangements one would expect between good neighbours and of good relationships between parallel Administrations on the island of Ireland in the interests of providing better services for all the people we serve.</p>

            <p eId="para_106">In replies to parliamentary questions in both November 2006 and November 2007, the former Taoiseach reported comprehensively on the progress being made in the implementation of the findings of the Sullivan report.

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_107">The House will recall that the Sullivan report arose from what was described as the A case in 1996, where the constitutionality of the Sexual Offences Act 1935 was challenged and a man was released from prison who had sexually offended a minor.  There was great hue and cry about it at the time and eventually the Supreme Court overturned the High Court decision.  The issue that arose and which gave rise to the Sullivan report was the question of how the Government had been caught unawares by this case and how a case with constitutional implications was proceeding through the courts and the Government did not know about it or how the Attorney General had not been personally advised of it at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">The Sullivan report recommended a number of procedures which the Taoiseach now says have been fully implemented.  If they have been fully implemented, how did the same happen again recently?  On 13 October the House was informed that a decision had been made in the High Court in respect of the Mental Health Act and the House had to convene very quickly to pass amending mental health legislation.  The health spokespersons were informed about it only a few hours before the legislation was brought in.  If the Sullivan report has been implemented and there are now procedures in place, apparently, to deal with circumstances where there is a case in the court, how did a replica situation arise in respect of the mental health legislation?  How was the Government caught unawares a second time by a court action that presumably should have been flagged to the relevant Minister at an earlier stage?</p>

            <p eId="para_109">The question is general in nature but the question the Deputy has now asked by way of a supplementary is specific and it is the responsibility of another member of the Government.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach can assist with it as he would not have notice of it.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_110">I take that point.  I was going to say in my initial reply that I would like a specific question put down on that matter in the interests of accuracy so that we could put on the record of the House the exact circumstances that arose in the case of the specific instance referred to.  I recall that issue but I do not have exact recall of the circumstances of it.  I recall in general terms the point made by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">I will make two points.  Sometimes a decision arises out of a court case which may be quite surprising and has not been predicted and which requires an immediate move by the Oireachtas to close any lacuna or loophole that is identified and which could have a wider policy implication by way of third party judicial review or <i>ex parte</i> application by others in similar circumstances, which was precisely the issue that arose in the CC case when other people who saw themselves as in similar positions as to the state of their detention were taking on the legal opportunity of seeing if they could fit through the precedent set in the CC case.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">The question refers to the recommendations made in a report conducted by the then Secretary General of the public service management and development division and whether those have been implemented.  My information is that they have been implemented.  The report found that the reason the Attorney General was not notified or consulted on the remaining milestones as to how that case was progressing — this was regarded as an important and sensitive case — arose as a result of administrative error.  It should be noted that the report also stated that no perfect system could be designed to deal with such administrative errors but Mr. Sullivan was satisfied that the initiatives under way, the new measures which were being proposed and the recommendations arising from the review, would further enhance the operations of the Attorney General's office and reduce the risk of such an event recurring.  It does not eliminate the possibility of risk since human error, administrative error, cannot be excised no matter how robust a system is devised but a system could be devised to reduce the risk to the greatest extent possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">I cannot recall with certainty that the issue the Deputy has raised now arose in the same set of circumstances as the one that gave rise to the report in the first place.  I will ask the Attorney General's office to give me a note on the circumstances of that occurrence and Deputy Gilmore can in the correspondence decide whether that point stands up.</p>

            <p eId="para_114">The Taoiseach in his first reply to me said that all of the recommendations of the Sullivan report had now been implemented, which I welcome.  The purpose was to avoid a situation where the Government finds itself flat-footed by a decision of the High Court, that the Government is apprised of cases coming down the track in the courts that could have constitutional implications or implications for the striking down of key legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">A number of procedures were recommended by the Sullivan report, including personal notification to the Attorney General of cases that have constitutional implications.  There was to be a three-person expert committee to be established which would do some kind of risk assessment and there was also to be regular briefings by the Attorney General to the Secretary General to the Government. Is the Taoiseach aware of any significant cases currently in the courts that may have constitutional implications and may require, depending on the outcome, legislative changes?  Are contingency plans being made by the Government in respect of any such cases?</p>

            <p eId="para_116">The Sullivan review arose in the context of an information and notification deficit that occurred in the Attorney General's office over the handling of the CC case.  The review's purpose was to ensure that in those cases that met the criteria of being important and sensitive, there would be arrangements in place whereby the Attorney General would be informed and consulted on their progress.  This would ensure the Attorney General would have a personal knowledge of them and the system would not allow for an administrative error where the Attorney General was not consulted when he should have been because of the sensitivity and importance of such cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">In the CC case, the Deputy will recall the report identified seven milestones in the evolution of the case about which the Attorney General ought to have been informed or consulted.  The Attorney General had been consulted on only one of those, the nomination of counsel in the case.  The report instanced the various relevant procedures and protocols already in force in the Attorney General's office at the time.  It also instanced the policies in operation to ensure staff were aware of the requirement that it would be brought to the Attorney General's attention as important stages of the case progressed and the existing office co-ordination arrangements that provided further mechanisms to assist in the observance of the requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">Nineteen measures were recommended for adoption by the Sullivan report to minimise the risk of a reoccurrence of such events.  These would not eliminate entirely the possibility because that cannot be guaranteed fully.  The new measures related to enhanced risk assessment procedures, including external reviews etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">Up to 120 cases of constitutional action are being taken against the State.  When linked cases are taken into account, approximately 250 cases are being taken as challenges to the constitutionality of Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments.  Ireland has a strong judicial review procedure.  Parties and citizens can apply to court to seek declarations or orders in respect of the constitutionality, or otherwise, of any aspect of statute law.  The secretary to the Government is notified of the progress of these cases.  If there are any particular issues which would act as an early warning system for the secretary, the Attorney General would bring these to his attention.  This would be in a minority of those cases, as others trundle along, some important, others less important for public policy implications.</p>

            <p eId="para_120">Following the collapse of the CC case on statutory rape, I made the point that there was a gap in the law in the protection of children from sexual predators and the need for a constitutional amendment.  Has an amendment been considered by the Government or has it been given priority?  The case arose because of a breakdown in communications between State agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">It has been suggested to me on several occasions that there has been a serious reduction in prosecutions of allegations of statutory rape being pursued by the Director of Public Prosecutions because of concerns over a defendant claiming he made a mistake about the victim's age.  Is there any substance to these allegations?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_65">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_122">The supplementary information I have on foot of the questions tabled relates generally to the Sullivan report rather than the present legal status of statutory rape laws as a result of the CC case.  I would have to check whether any lessons are to be learned or reviews drawn up to further amend the law, or perhaps a question should be tabled to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">The Director of Public Prosecutions has stated that quantifying comparative numbers of prosecutions for sexual offences involving children in the years before and after the CC <i>v</i>. Ireland case in 2006 may give a misleading picture due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the loss of section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 as an option.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">Cases which were pending when CC <i>v</i>. Ireland was decided were examined.  Where other charges were appropriate, they were brought.  In a small number of cases, no other charges were appropriate and in some cases injured parties no longer wished to proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">Substitution of sexual assault on other charges for section 1(1) charges muddies the waters from a statistical perspective in the years both before and after the finding of unconstitutionality.  Further complications arise in that the Director of Public Prosecution's files are assigned on the basis of the year in which they are received in that office.  Such files may relate to offences which took place months, years or decades previously.  They may not reach the courts for months and years afterwards.  This creates further difficulties from a statistical standpoint if what is sought is a year-by-year comparative analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_126">Accordingly, the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot definitively say that he is prosecuting either more or fewer child rapes than he was previously.  There is a comparison between unlawful carnal knowledge and defilement, appropriate as the new offence under the 2006 Act is broader in its scope than the old section 1(1) of the 1935 Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_129">When the Sullivan report was published into the handling of the A case in the Attorney General's office, I recall the Green Party making a case for a fully independent inquiry to scrutinise the workings and channels of communication between the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  What was the Taoiseach's response to that call from his coalition partners?  Has that strong demand been maintained by the Green Party since?</p>
            <p eId="para_130">Will the Taoiseach reconfirm all the recommendations of the Sullivan report have been implemented?  Is he satisfied sufficient checks and balances are in place between the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_131">As I stated in the original reply, I am informed by the Attorney General that all the report's recommendations have been implemented.  A three-person panel of experts, a risk management group, also made recommendations which were referred to in the Sullivan report.  Appropriate action has been taken to implement that group's recommendations and its members have been informed.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">A legal management advisory committee has been established.  It met on 9 April, 9 July and 28 October 2008 to consider reports on legal issues, to draft memoranda to the Government on sensitive cases etc.  The annual report for the Office of the Attorney General, currently being finalised, is expected to be submitted to the Government shortly and will be published as soon as possible thereafter.  Members will have an opportunity to examine it then.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">To answer Deputy Gilmore's earlier point on the recent emergency Bill in the health area, the Mental Health Act shows that the office could still be taken by surprise.  The issue that gave rise to the need for emergency legislation in the form of the Mental Health Act arose in the course of a hearing that commenced on 7 October 2008 as a result of evidence given.  The issue was not pleaded in the original statement of the case and was raised by the High Court judge.  It became a preliminary issue during the hearing of the judicial review on 14 October.  As soon as the issue was raised in the case, the need for emergency legislation was raised with the Department of Health and Children by the Office of the Attorney General.  The Office of the Attorney General prepared draft legislation on the instructions of the Department, which was enacted on 30 October, within two weeks of it being raised in the case.  This was the day before the delivery of judgment in the case.  All appropriate procedures concerning the sensitivity of this file were followed and the issue in the case was handled as a matter of urgency.  It was dealt with in the shortest possible time and the question raised by Deputy Gilmore reinforces the fact that procedures were operating quite well as the reply, which I have just uncovered in the series of supplementaries attached to the question, suggests.</p>
            <p eId="para_134">Regarding the memory of Deputy Ó Caoláin about the position of the Green Party at that time, I can only presume that the comprehensive recommendations of the Sullivan report provided the public interest response and the subsequent full implementation reinforces the fact that the confidence was well placed.</p>

Can the Taoiseach confirm it will not be guillotined on Second Stage?  I have heard many Government Deputies down the country saying the decision on withdrawing medical cards from persons over 70 was wrong.  I would like them to have the opportunity to repeat that in the Dáil.  I will object to this if Second Stage is to be guillotined.  I regard the Bill as the betrayal of the elderly.  They were given a specific assurance by the Government that, on reaching 70 years of age, they would be given a medical card for the part they played in building up this country and sustaining it.  This Bill gives legal effect to taking away what had become a right for them.  They felt insulted and betrayed as a consequence.  If the Taoiseach assures me that the Bill will not be guillotined on Second Stage, we will not object to it but I will vote against it now if the Bill is to be guillotined.</p>

There is no proposal on this before us this morning but we can see the guillotine in the distance.  It will be applied at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow.  That is what the Labour Party Whip has been told.

This Health Bill is a further step from the provision of universal health care for all citizens on the basis of need.  It is absolutely objectionable because it excludes a sector of the over 70s from its automatic entitlement to a medical card that has heretofore, as a result of a previous Government decision, been afforded full access to the medical card.  It is a most cold, callous and inappropriate measure and one that I ask the Taoiseach to withdraw from the Order Paper in its entirety.  It is signalled for a guillotine at the conclusion of Second Stage at 1.30 p.m. and a second guillotine is signalled for 6.30 p.m. on all remaining Stages.  It should be removed from the Order Paper immediately and the Government, however late in the day at this 11th hour, should take the decision to withdraw the measure and to respond to the cry of the senior citizens of this country and all who stand for health care justice in this jurisdiction.  The legislation should be withdrawn, as it does not include measures that would be beneficial to our citizenry and it is counter to all that was committed to in the programme for government, which signalled the Government's intent to extend eligibility.

It is detrimental to the elderly and to the economy because the measure it seeks to rescind has been shown to bring social and health gains to the persons concerned.  The longitudinal study at St. James's Hospital has proven that beyond doubt.  The paltry sum of money that will be saved — €16 million in general practitioner fees — could have been saved without damage to the elderly if negotiations had taken place.  I ask that the House reject the Order for Second Stage and that the Government continue its negotiations with pharmacists and other professionals and leave the elderly out of it.</p>

We in Sinn Féin absolutely oppose the reneging on the commitment already given to over 70s to an entitlement for all to a medical card.  This is a retrograde step, one that moves away from what we would wish to see in place, namely, universal entitlement to medical care for all citizens on the basis of need and need alone.  We will oppose this retrograde Bill at every opportunity.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_532">The Health Bill 2008 gives effect to recent Government decisions to end the automatic entitlement to a medical card, irrespective of income, for people aged 70 years and over and to introduce new arrangements in order that the vast majority of people aged 70 years and over will continue to have medical cards under a new income threshold.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">With the enactment of this Bill, people aged 70 years and over will have three gateways to a medical card.  First, under the new gross income limits, we expect 95% will qualify because their income will be below the new limits of €700 a week for a single person or €1,400 for a couple.  Second, people whose gross income is above the limits may still apply for a medical card using the standard net income means test which applies for people aged under 70 years.  This takes account of personal circumstances, such as high outgoings on nursing home fees.  Third, a person may still apply for and be granted a medical card if his or her health circumstances cause undue hardship, under the discretionary medical card arrangements.  Many people who have terminal illnesses, for example, are granted medical cards even if they do not qualify under the means test.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">For those who are now aged 70 years or over — or become so by the end of this month — there will be no new means test.  For those who turn 70 years in the new year, there will be a much simplified means test, designed to show that their gross income is below the new limits.  These new arrangements will improve the sustainability of financing of medical card services for older people and allow resources to be targeted to those most in need. In particular, they enable the ending of the specially high capitation fee for general practitioners which has been paid since 2001 only in respect of over 70 year olds who received a medical card by virtue of age rather than means.  This payment had the distinction of being discriminatory, inequitable and financially unsustainable.  It was paid in respect of about 38% of people aged 70 and over.  A wide range of people, including general practitioners, is pleased that the perverse incentive that this special fee created between different general practices is being ended.  I welcome again the recommendation of Mr. Eddie Sullivan of a single fee capitation level of €290, which we intend to implement from 1 January next.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Under existing legislation, the objective of the general medical services scheme is to ensure the medical card benefit is available to those who are unable, without undue hardship, to meet the cost of health services for themselves and their dependants.  People aged 70 years and over are more likely to require regular access to health services and it is appropriate that additional support is put in place to enable their access to medical care.  At the same time, it is consistent with the general approach of the GMS for many years and the need to provide for financially sustainable schemes, that the medical card should be provided to all but the top 5% of income earners among the over 70s.  There are and will continue to be pressing calls on scarce resources to meet the needs of many people across the whole range of health services.  Fundamentally, it is better that we devote taxpayers' funds to meet those needs rather than pay for access to medical services for those who can, in any event, have full access to general practitioner services using their own resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Fortunately, people in Ireland are living longer and healthier lives.  This is due in no small part to better health services and the higher living standards as a result of economic growth.  We also have the youngest population in Europe, with only about 11% of people aged over 65 years.  This will change in the years ahead as our population ages and lives longer.  We we should welcome and prudently plan for the development in every respect, including Exchequer commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The number of people over 70 years is projected to increase to 363,000 by 2011, 433,000 by 2016 and to 535,000 by 2021.  We need to plan for and provide many health services for the people now aged 55 years and over who will form the over 70 age group at that time and use public resources in the most effective and fairest way to provide these services.  In that context, the continuation of the automatic medical card and the specially high capitation fee paid for it does not represent prudent or fair financial planning.  Resources should be used for those with the greatest medical and financial need.  While some people counter this basic principle with a call for universalism in all services, it is highly relevant that our primary care services, in particular, GP practices, provide the same service to all, irrespective of the basis of payment.  That is a universal service.  A quality service that is accessible by all, with different rates of contribution or payment, based on means, is one that is equitable and fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I now propose to briefly outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 3 provides for the replacement of section 45(5A) of the Health Act 1970 which provided, since 2001, for an automatic entitlement to a medical card for all persons aged 70 years and over who are ordinarily resident in the State, irrespective of their means.  The old section 45(5A) is replaced by this new section 45(5A) which provides that those people who are aged 70 years or over before 1 January 2009 and who had full eligibility on age grounds will continue to have full eligibility provided their gross income from all sources does not exceed the specified limits.  These limits, which are set out in section 45A, are €700 per week gross in the case of a single person, excluding any income from savings or similar investments whose principal value is €36,000 or less, and €1,400 per week gross in the case of a couple, excluding any income from savings or similar investments whose principal value is €72,000 or less.  A person who was automatically entitled to a medical card, and therefore had full eligibility by virtue of the old subsection 45(5A), will continue to have full eligibility until 2 March 2009.  Consequently, all persons can continue to use their medical card as normal until 2 March 2009 even if their gross income exceeds the relevant income limits set out in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Section 4 provides for the insertion of a new subsection, 45(A), in the 1970 Act dealing with the eligibility of persons aged 70 and over, and their dependants, for a medical card from 1 January, 2009.  It provides that people reaching 70 on or after 1 January will have to make an application to the HSE and provided they meet the income and other criteria of age and ordinary residency, they will receive a medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">A simplified means test will be arranged to enable people to apply.  They will receive confirmation from the HSE that they have full eligibility and will continue to have it so long as their gross income does not exceed the limit.  This section also covers people who have already reached 70 prior to the 1 January 2009, but who, for a variety of reasons, may not have applied for a medical card under section 45(5A) of the Health Act 1970, which provided for automatic entitlement to a medical card for all persons aged 70 and over.  This section provides that dependants of persons covered in this section and section 45(5A) will also have full eligibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The gross income limits which will apply under this Bill from 1 January 2009  for single persons are €700 per week, excluding income from savings or similar investments whose capital value does not exceed €36,000.  For couples, the gross income limits are €1,400 per week for people who are married or living together as husband and wife, excluding income from savings or similar investments whose capital value does not exceed €72,000.  The couple limit of €1,400 will also apply where the spouse or partner is under 70.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">This section requires that I review the consumer price index annually on 1 September and provides that the gross income limits may be increased to reflect any increase in the index.  In this Bill I am making provision for the exclusion of income, and interest earned thereon, arising from certain compensation awards payable by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">These include compensation awards to persons under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Acts 1997 to 2006, compensation awards by way of the Residential Institutions Redress Board, established under section 3 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, prescribed repayments made under section 8 of the Health Repayment Scheme Act 2006 made to a living relevant person, to the spouse or former spouse of a living or deceased relevant person, directly to a living child of a relevant person by virtue of section 9(8) of that Act and <i>ex gratia</i> awards approved by the Lourdes Hospital Redress Board under the terms of the Lourdes Hospital Redress Scheme 2007.  It further provides that I may make regulations prescribing further payments made for similar purposes also to be excluded as income for the purposes of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">This section also gives effect to the Government's commitment not to impute income from property.  For the purposes of assessing gross income under this Bill, income will not be imputed from any property, whether it is a family home, a holiday home or any other property, unless it is rented, and only the net rental income, calculated as gross income less any costs necessarily associated with the rental of the property, will be included for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">Sections 5 and 6 are technical amendments which amend sections 47 and 47(A) respectively of the 1970 Act to provide for the new section 45(A) being inserted in the Act by this Bill.  The amendment to section 47 provides that the appeals process available to persons under section 45 of the Act will also now apply to persons over 70 qualifying for a medical card under this Bill. The amendment to section 47(A) provides that guidelines on persons ordinarily resident in the State issued for the purposes of assisting the determination of an appeal under section 47 shall now also apply to persons qualifying for a medical card under this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Section 7 provides that people who are 70 years of age before 1 January and who hold a medical card on the basis of automatic eligibility under section 45(5A), prior to the enactment of this Bill, shall notify the HSE, no later than 2 March 2009, if they have concluded that their income exceeds the gross income limits.  I want to ensure that the process of self-assessment required under this provision will be much simplified compared to that required under the existing hardship-based scheme.  Consequently, I have asked the HSE to ensure that any assistance that a person may need in relation to self-assessment will be made available by the HSE on an administrative basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Subsection (<i>b</i>) amends section 49(2) of the 1970 Act such that the provisions applicable to a person who knowingly contravenes the requirement set out in subsection (1) to notify the HSE of any change in the circumstances that entitle him or her to a service provided by the HSE under the Health Acts shall also apply to persons qualifying for a medical card under this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The purpose of section 8 is to amend section 4 of the Health Contributions Act 1979 to provide an exemption from the health contribution for any person who is or reaches the age of 70 on or after 1 January 2009.  The amendment will exempt everybody over 70 from paying the contribution regardless of whether they fall into the existing categories exempted under section 11 of the 1979 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Sections 9 and 10 are technical amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 so that the existing statutory provisions in relation to the sharing of information between public bodies, which already apply to section 45 of the 1970 Act, shall now also apply to section 45(A) of that Act as inserted by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">Section 11 is a technical amendment to ensure that the existing statutory provision in relation to the sharing of information between the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the HSE, which already applies to section 45 of the 1970 Act, shall now also apply to section 45(A) of that Act as inserted by this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The Government has been concerned at all times in these new arrangements to ensure that a person aged 70 or over would not lose their medical card as an immediate consequence of the death of their spouse.  We have explored all possible solutions in recent weeks within the boundaries of what was possible from a non-discrimination point of view as between widowed persons and single persons.  I propose to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to give effect to this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">This Bill is designed to give effect to the Government's decision to replace the automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over with a new arrangement based on gross income limits.  Under the new arrangement, the limits are set at a sufficiently high rate to ensure that the majority of people aged 70 and over will continue to qualify for a medical card.  I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing the views of Deputies.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_559">This Bill has been opposed by this side of the House and for good reason.  I want to discuss some of the facts.  There are 350,000 people over the age of 70 in Ireland and approximately 215,000, or 60%, have a medical card based on assessment.  The other 40%, or 140,000, have a medical card on the basis of their age.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">On 14 October the Minister announced that from 1 January the automatic entitlement would end and this cutback would save €100 million.  We were very critical of this at the time because we felt this was taking the easy option and hitting the elderly rather than attempting to make savings through the renegotiation of the capitation rate offered to GPs, the prescribing of generic medicines and negotiations with pharmacists.  A vote was forced on the issue. It is important to point out that many backbench TDs from the Government side spoke against this, but then voted for it.  They certainly spoke out against it in their constituencies, but when it came to walking the walk, only Deputy Joe Behan walked.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The fact is that the over 70s medical card cost €220 million last year, while €86 million of this was attributed to GPs' fees.  Following all the brouhaha, the Minister has managed to save €16 million, which gives lie to the spin that this was all about GPs' fees.  It was more about the incompetence of a Minister who could have negotiated this with the pharmacists and the GPs, and left the over 70s with their medical cards and out of this row.  She did not need to upset 350,000 pensioners and their families.  Why did she not follow the internal advice given to her by the Department of Finance four days before the budget?  Ultimately, she took that advice, but there was ample opportunity at the time to take a different route than the one she chose to take, which was to bring in the ban.  She offered several different income levels and thresholds, which caused total confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">She maintains today that the bulk of people will keep their medical cards and that only 20,000 will lose them.  However, the reality is that many people who are above that €700 gross threshold will not have a medical card.  How many of these are retired schoolteachers, retired gardaí, retired nurses and other public and civil servants who have done the State some service?  It is interesting to note that the IMO, in its submission, identified €80 million in drugs savings, which makes for €96 million in total when we add the amount saved by the Minister on fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I am very concerned about some of the provisions in this Bill.  I obviously oppose the Bill, as I reject the Minister's idea that universality is not something that is achievable or affordable.  I contend that it is, and we will implement it if afforded the opportunity in Government to do so.  However, the Bill requires people to declare after 2 March whether they are eligible.  The Bill is not clear on the consequences of that, as it alludes to another section in another Bill.  I would like the Minister to spell out what happens to somebody who fails a means test after 2 March.  What happens to somebody who is not good at filling out forms or who has a fear of forms, such as somebody in a nursing home who might be mildly confused?  It is not clear how this will work and what the consequences are for people.  There is very little information on the means test and there is no information on the conditions under which people who wish to apply due to changing circumstances will be considered ineligible.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">One of the major issues I have with this Bill is the line which states the Minister will review and may change the threshold, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  There are two caveats in there for people.  Having seen the record of the Government in keeping promises, people do not trust the Minister to do that.  They would much prefer to see "shall" in that line, and have the Minister for Finance removed from the equation.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">I doubt it very much.  Inflation for the current medical card system has been positive, but it has not changed in the last couple of years.  We need to find out how we have arrived at a situation where the threshold has been set at little over half the minimum wage for the other medical card.  If one has the temerity in this country to work, one does not get a medical card.  The Minister has previously said that she is after millionaires with this measure.  Gardaí, nurses and others are certainly not millionaires.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">What will happen to those in nursing homes?  The Minister had said that she will reduce tax relief on nursing homes from 41% to 20% after January 2010.  Is that gone now?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_176" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Deputy Mary Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_570">That is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  It is in the amendment to the Finance Bill 2008.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_571">We would like to be absolutely assured of that.  It would help, because otherwise it would represent another blow to the elderly.  As this fair deal fund is capped, many people will not be able to avail of it.  There will be a queue to get into nursing homes, but many will not be able to afford it.  A third of people currently in nursing homes would not satisfy the criteria of high dependency to which the fair deal will be limited.  Many people who find themselves in excess of €700 will have no money left because they are paying €50,000 per annum to a nursing home.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The Bill is not clear on what is included in the means test, and the Department of Health and Children has published no information on what it means by a "simplified means test".  Section 4(4) of the Bill states the calculation of gross income will include gross income from all sources.  This includes pensions and investments, or savings with an income disregard of €36,000 for a single person and €72,000 for a couple, net rental income from property and any income from part-time employment.  It is not clear how incomes on savings and investments are calculated, whether money gained from the sale of the principal private residence is considered, whether a person is eligible if he or she is in a nursing home and has income which exceeds the €700 threshold, but the cost of the nursing home care completely absorbs the income, or whether the person's income is absorbed by excessive health expenses due to serious illness.  What happens to siblings sharing a home and associated property and who have shared their expenses all their lives?  Are they considered to be single or a couple?  How is their property assessed?  I know people in their 40s who have given up work to look after their parents, sometimes because one of the siblings is a bachelor and has continued to work in the home.  If that person dies, do the circumstances change for the person who is still earning?  Will the capital of any property other than the family home also be assessed?</p>
          <p eId="para_573">How is the fluctuating nature of income on such investments to be calculated?  Dividends and interest rates vary, sometimes dramatically.  Will this mean that an individual may qualify for a medical card in one year, but lose it the following year?  What about interest on post office products, savings bonds and savings certificates?  Are these included in the calculation of gross income?  Savings bonds are exempt from income tax, and the income levy is not paid on income from savings certificates, which is administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  Will people who were encouraged to save under the SSIA be penalised for their savings?  Is income from the rent a room scheme included?</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The budget is changing the health expenses relief, yet the Minister tells us today that the Minister for Finance is not considering interfering with that relief.  That is to be welcomed, but we would like to see it in the Act so that we can be sure of it, because there have been many U-turns recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">People who are terminally ill have significant medical expenses.  Many of them are above the limit, but historically they could apply to the HSE for a discretionary medical card and it would be given without any questions asked.  Now they are being made jump through loops of red tape when they are at their weakest and most vulnerable.  Many of them have been refused.  We are not talking about millionaires, but about ordinary people.  As I have said in the House previously, people who live in Walkinstown, Ballyfermot and many other places have been refused.  The people in question are not millionaires.  There is no guarantee that such people will receive a discretionary medical card.  The means testing regime that is to be introduced was not previously in place.  Medical cards were given to people who did not have long to live as a token of their service to the State.  The provision of medical cards eased the concerns of such people about the cost of medical equipment, some of which is not available or is difficult to get outside the public health system.  Are people to be deprived of morphine pumps?  Will it continue to be possible for them to get hospital-type beds and commodes in their homes to allow them to stay at home?  These are the sorts of things we are talking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I asked the Minister a straight question at a committee meeting last week.  I asked her whether she would remove the cap on discretionary medical cards for the elderly and bring an end to the means-testing of such people.  She did not answer that question in the affirmative.  The Department of Health and Children contacted a newspaper to say that the Minister had indicated that it would be the case.  I will give the Minister an opportunity to answer my question with a simple "Yes" or "No".  Will the cap on discretionary medical cards for the terminally ill be removed and will the means-testing of the terminally ill be brought to an end?  I am quite happy for the Minister to answer the question now if she likes.</p>

          <p eId="para_600">Many measures that will hurt the elderly were introduced in budget 2009.  They will lose their medical cards.  They will have to pay accident and emergency charges that have increased by €34 to €100 and public bed hospital charges that have increased by €9 to €75 a night.  The cost of private beds in public hospitals has increased by 20%.  The threshold for the drugs payment scheme has increased from €90 a month to €100 a month.  Long-stay charges will increase by €33.25 a week for class 1 and by €24.95 a week for class 2.  Health expenses relief, other than in respect of nursing home care, if we are to believe the Minister, has been reduced to the standard rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">An article in today's <i>The Irish Times</i> mentions the case of a 77 year old woman who lives alone.  When she suffered a stroke, she fell and broke her hip.  She was brought straight to the accident and emergency department in her local hospital.  If she did not have a medical card, she would have had to pay an accident and emergency charge of €100.  She would have to pay €100 a month for her regular medication and she would have had to pay for her GP visits.  The article estimates that when drugs refund scheme charges, physiotherapy and occupational therapy and follow-up GP visits are taken into account, the cost of the loss of a medical card to such a woman would have been €1,920.  The elderly cannot afford to pay that much money.  That is why they are so concerned about medical cards.  Age Action Ireland and the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament are vehemently opposed to this proposal.  I do not understand why we cannot show solidarity with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">This measure is penny wise and pound foolish.  A longitudinal study that was conducted by St. James's Hospital shows clearly that the introduction of universal medical card access for people over the age of 70 led to reductions in strokes, heart attacks and rates of hospitalisation.  It brought about a considerable saving to the State and a considerable social gain for elderly patients.  The word "hypocrisy" was mentioned earlier.  I suggest that it is hypocritical to say one thing and do something else.  I ask Deputy Treacy to bear in mind that hypocrisy does not involve changing one's mind on the basis of new information, which is what evidence-based professionals are prepared to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">According to figures published by the CSO, people over the age of 70 visit the doctor 5.2 times per annum.  However, a recent study conducted by one of the largest general practices in the country found that people over the age of 70 visited the practice 11.1 times per annum.  The increase in visits has resulted from the availability of medical cards.  We need to monitor illness, which is more frequent and prevalent among the elderly.  We need to prevent the complications that tend to land elderly people in hospital.  We should not put a block, in the form of expense, between people and their GPs.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I would like to ask the Minister about the issue of nutritional supplements, which is being studied at present by a group led by Dr. Michael Barry.  I hope the group will understand the value of these medicines.  I refer, for example, to the fact that they are of great benefit to people who are elderly, malnourished or terminally ill, such as people with chronic illnesses who cannot absorb their food properly.  Many studies have pointed to the glaring fact that malnourished people have much worse outcomes when they undergo surgery, particularly major surgery, than those who are properly nourished when they go under an anaesthetic.  That is hugely important.  I hope the focus will not be on saving money yet again, rather than on clinical benefit to patients.  Section 7 of this legislation provides that current medical card holders who are over the age of 70 will have to make a declaration to the HSE by 2 March 2009.  As I mentioned earlier, the Bill does not appear to accommodate those who might have difficulty making such a declaration.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I have already referred to the issue of universality.  Many people are concerned that this measure represents the first step in the removal of the universal principle.  They believe it will be followed by the abolition of universality in respect of the electricity allowance, the natural gas allowance, the electricity group account allowance, the bottled gas refill allowance, the telephone allowance and the free television allowance.  People look forward to being able to avail of such allowances, having worked hard all their lives, when they pass the age of 70.  They want to plan for the future without having to worry about expenses of this nature.  Many people have told me they would give up their second pension rather than lose their medical card.  This has been said publicly.  That is how important the medical card is to them.  They are keen to enjoy the comfort and safety of knowing they will be looked after, without money being an issue, if they get sick.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">A major upset to the elderly of Ireland has been caused for the sake of €16 million.  The former Deputy, Joe Higgins, used to complain that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, had stolen his clothes.  It seems that Deputy Ahern took those clothes with him when he left office.  He has left Fianna Fáil naked and bereft of any social conscience.  It is clear that the Government has lost its compassion for the people.  If that were not the case, it would not have instituted this attack on the elderly.  What other conclusion can one draw?  What party with a social conscience would rob the medical card from the elderly, cut tax relief on nursing home fees and increase VHI premiums?  I ask the Minister to reverse this measure.</p>

          <p eId="para_607">The withdrawal of the medical card from the elderly has been a disaster for the elderly, who will lose their cards, as well as for the Minister, the Government and Deputy Behan.  It has been a fiscal disaster in the sense that it was originally intended to save €100 million but we have just heard that it will save €16 million.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Noonan</from>
          <p eId="para_609">I estimate the saving at €20 million, although Deputy Reilly has said it will be €16 million.  In her introductory remarks, the Minister did not state how much she estimates this measure will save.  When the Minister, Deputy Martin, introduced this political brainwave in the first instance, a couple of days before that year's budget, it was a bit of a disaster.  The Comptroller and Auditor General subsequently studied this issue and referred it to the Committee of Public Accounts.  If I recall, the Government estimated at the time that it would cost €12 million or €13 million, but it cost over €70 million in the first year.  The full-year cost at the time was approximately €115 million.  The Accounting Officer responsible for it, the then Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children, explained that the Civil Service had been rushed into estimating the cost of the measure a couple of days before the budget.  It did not have time to do a proper calculation.  This system has a fairly ragged history, but we are where we are.  The Minister would have been as well off to abandon it completely when she had to pull it back to such an extent under pressure from the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party.  There are no great savings now and there is still considerable grief around.  However, we are where we are and we have an obligation to try to improve the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Those people who have medical cards already and whose income exceeds the new limits will get notification from the HSE and will be requested to own up if their income is in excess of the means test limit.  The Minister's colleagues in Fianna Fáil are effectively tacitly advising the elderly to lie.  I have heard them on radio saying, "You'll get the letter.  Ignore it and you'll hold on to your card.  Don't say anything.  That's fine".  However, the Minister has said that in many cases the Paymaster General would have an account.  I heard her suggest in a radio interview that there would be cross-checking on pension income through the Office of the Paymaster General.  She has been silent on the matter today.  I wonder what the situation now is.  Is there a tacit agreement in Government that when people get notice they will lose their medical cards if they are over the new means test limit, they should ignore the letter or is the Minister saying there will be cross-checking?  If there is cross-checking and if later in the year people are found to have ignored the request to state their income, what measures will be taken?  Are there penalties attached?</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The Minister has reduced the means test provisions considerably.  I do not know of any institution where a person can earn 5% on money on deposit.  Even a month ago when interest rates were high, a person would not get 5% when the 23% or 24% DIRT is deducted.  At present with interest rates dropping rapidly, to impute 5% to savings is not realisable and is not real income.  The Minister is deliberately inflating the figures.  I know there is a discount of €36,000 and €72,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">One category of people come to me quite regularly now lobbying against the change, which I ask the Minister to take into account.  They are mostly women on State pensions who are widowed.  They also have a social welfare pension — a widow's pension or survivor's pension.  The combination of a teacher's, nurse's or garda's pension and a social welfare pension is driving them over the limit.  There are other social welfare payments which also drive people over the limit in restricted circumstances, including carer's allowance etc.  The Minister is exempting property from the means test.  Somebody could have a house in Spain, a house in Kerry and a residence in Dublin.  None of the residential property is taken into account.  Yet if someone has a social welfare payment it is taken into account.  The Minister would take much of the steam out of the opposition to the new measures if widows' pensions were not put into the calculation of the means test.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Across the public service €36,400 is above most pensions for public servants.  Most such pensions are in the low €30,000s rather than in the high €30,000s and I can see why the Minister pitched it at that level.  However, if they have any social welfare benefit — many of them have, particularly widowed persons — that is driving them over the limit and they are all losing their medical cards.  I received a circular letter during the week signed by 65 retired teachers in Limerick.  Approximately 60 of them were women who were widowed and they were all losing their medical cards.  I would like the Minister to reconsider that.  The savings have been whittled away to such an extent that she should address that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">There is confusion in the Department of Health and Children about what constitutes a couple.  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008 regards a couple as a married couple, a heterosexual couple living as a married couple or a homosexual couple living together.  It does not include two siblings or any such arrangement.  This Bill contains a different definition of a couple.  It seems to be a heterosexual couple, a married couple or a couple living together as a married couple and there are other exclusions.  The Bill should include siblings as well.  More than anything else the Department should standardise its definition of a couple.  It appears somewhat perverse that different legislation can come from the Department of Health and Children with different definitions of a couple.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The conditions for qualifying for a medical card under the Bill are threefold.  First, a person must be over 70.  Second, the person must qualify under the means test.  Third a person must be ordinarily resident in the country.  I have come across a group of people who have previously been caught out on social welfare payments and medical cards by the requirement to be ordinarily resident in the country.  The category relates to missionaries.  Priests, nuns and brothers who have been on missions for years are not ordinarily resident in the country.  When they come home they cannot get medical cards because they are not ordinarily resident in the country.  Many of them come home on an annual basis when they become elderly.  They may be home for two or three months.  Others take time out and might be home for a year or six months and then return.  Nuns in particular return to their home convent.  They might stay for a significant stretch of time and then go back out again.  That category is disqualified.  They have contributed considerably.  I need not go into the detail — we all know the work to which they have dedicated their lives.  I ask the Minister to draft an amendment to allow a waiver of the requirement to be ordinarily resident in the country for persons involved in missionary or charitable work abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">There is another category.  Increasingly laypeople volunteer upon retirement to work with Trócaire or GOAL.  I know of retired teachers, doctors and engineers who work in the underdeveloped world.  They are not ordinarily resident in the country.  They do not work for money.  They would be disqualified under the provisions of the Bill.  I ask the Minister to review the matter with a view to framing an amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">As mentioned by Deputy Reilly, the Minister should consider another area of the means test, which is medical expenses especially nursing home expenses.  If one's total income is taken up by nursing home fees, that should not disqualify one from a medical card.  We should also consider people who need to pay rent.  Ordinarily people who fail the means test would have their own homes.  However, for those paying rent, that rent should be taken into account as a reduction on the means.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I thank the Minister for her explanation.  We are where we are and in the interest of trying to improve the mandate for the elderly I ask her to take some of my suggestions into account and table amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">As I have already indicated the Labour Party will be vigorously opposing this legislation on all Stages.  The universal entitlement to a medical card, which gives free access to primary care, for all over 70s must not be taken away.  I again urge the Minister to reconsider her decision.  What has happened since the budget has considerably watered down the original proposal.  However, the inept way in which the change was introduced has shown that the Government is not in touch with the ordinary people on the matter.  I believe the Minister will find that many of the people sitting behind her and voting for the Bill are not at all happy with taking away this universal entitlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The granting of a legal right to a medical card to citizens when they reach the age of 70 was one of the few fruits of Ireland's recent prosperity that this age group was given.  It gave them peace of mind and the chance to stay healthy and out of hospital.  Having a medical card allows such people to stay in their own homes longer.  They get their primary care and also benefits such as visits from the public health nurse, the supply of incontinence pads if they need them, visits from a physiotherapist and chiropody.  There is a variety of other benefits that come with a medical card, which have allowed many of our senior citizens to stay in their own homes and community rather than being in an expensive hospital bed.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_627">The current chairman and board of FÁS were appointed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 2006, in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Services Act 1987.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">I met with the chairman and some members of the board of FÁS on 28 November and expressed my strong dissatisfaction at the events that had taken place in the public affairs division in FÁS.  At the meeting the board assured me that action had been taken to deal with these matters.  It also assured me that more robust structures with enhanced controls are now in place.  This will help accelerate the audit work already under way in the corporate affairs area.  It also will help FÁS to interface with the Comptroller and Auditor General in his examination of the effectiveness of the management and control systems in FÁS, which I understand he is to begin shortly.  The FÁS internal audit function is also being strengthened.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">In addition, the board agreed that a full examination of past practices is required to ensure the organisation can move forward with best practice, corporate governance procedures in place.  I understand the normal annual internal audit examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General is already under way in FÁS.  This audit will include an examination of internal procedures and governance arrangements within the organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">In my view, FÁS should continue to remain focused on its core mission, given the employment and training challenges currently facing the country.  I express my strong support for the work of the new interim director general, the chairman and the other members of the board in that regard.  In particular, I wish to acknowledge the ongoing commitment and importance of the staff of FÁS in helping us to meet the labour market challenges we face now and into the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_631">I note the Tánaiste did not answer my question which asked if she had full confidence in the chairman and the board of FÁS.  Without impugning the character of any individuals, it is important the question is answered.  I appreciate from the Tánaiste's remarks that there is at least some expression of regret from her for having given full backing to the director general of FÁS in June, when we first raised these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">In terms of follow up I have two key questions to ask the Tánaiste in respect of the board and the chairman.  Does she not have any concern about the fact the board and chairman signed off on the annual accounts, this year and last year?  They said: "No weaknesses were found in the system of internal financial controls".  Does the Tánaiste have no issue of confidence concerning the board in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_633">There is the issue of the use of first class travel.  As Members know, the first class travel used by board members and by FÁS officials was in contravention of the Department of Finance's guidelines on travel and subsistence.  When he spoke to the Committee of Public Accounts, the chairman of FÁS admitted that such travel had been inappropriate.  However, in my hand I have the invoice for €7,000 that covered his first-class flight to Florida.  Does the Tánaiste not think that inappropriate?  Arising from these two matters, perhaps she might answer my question, even with a yes or a no, as to whether she has full confidence in the chairman and the board.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_634">As the Deputy knows, I expressed my dissatisfaction with matters and on investigation was taking place.  An audit commenced in November 2004 arising from issues raised with my predecessor.  In June 2004, information was passed to the Garda and a final audit report was supplied in May 2006.  In February 2007, the FÁS internal audit report raised further concerns.  These were referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">As the Deputy knows, on my appointment in May this year, the report was noted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In June I met with the chairman and director general of FÁS to discuss the report and to seek assurances that matters were being addressed.  Those assurances were given in writing to my Secretary General in July this year.  In September, following further concerns, I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General to report on the effectiveness of the management and control systems across the organisation.  As the Deputy knows, in October, November and December of this year there were ongoing discussions with the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">It is important to say, therefore, that there had been disquiet and that concerns were raised a considerable period ago, in 2004, arising from notification to my predecessor at that time.  The process was ongoing.  Matters have been investigated and I have consulted the Comptroller and Auditor General, who agreed he will move forward on the basis of his completed work with the Committee of Public Accounts.  That will probably be brought to finality at the end of next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_637">It is on that basis I must say that the issues that have been raised are of grave concern.  As a consequence, they are being dealt with, and have been dealt with, <i>pro forma</i>, since 2004 when the information was provided.  I have been given assurances by the chairman of the board, by the board and by the director general that the regulations as set down by the Department of Finance are being adhered to.  As I indicated in my initial response, the issues that were raised are now being addressed and the internal audit aspect of the organisation is also being expanded in order to be more robust.</p>

            <p eId="para_640">The reality is that this has been going on for a long time.  There have been reports from the European Commission, internal audit reports, reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General, whistleblowing letters and concerns raised in this House.  The only reason any action was taken in recent months is that information was given to us and to others under the Freedom of Information Act.  This is an issue the Tánaiste might raise on our behalf, because FÁS continues to evade its responsibilities in terms of openness.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Some weeks ago we sought the details of HR2, the second human resources investigation into Mr. Gregory Craig.  The freedom of information officer in FÁS approved that request but under the new closing-down, darkening and tightening procedures introduced by the organisation all freedom of information requests must go to Mr. Cooney, the assistant director general, before being released.  That particular report has been on his desk for more than two weeks and, as a result, the deadline has expired.  Under the freedom of information legislation this is now classed as a technical refusal.  It was suggested to us that we should appeal the matter so it can be reviewed by somebody else in FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">Essentially, what we see in FÁS is secrecy getting worse.  Items that would have been released by the freedom of information officer in the past are now being sent to Mr. Cooney who is blocking them.  I hope the Tánaiste will raise that matter with the interim director general on behalf of the public.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
            <p eId="para_651">The 35 county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, are the principal deliverers of State support to the micro-enterprise sector in Ireland.  They provide support to businesses with ten or fewer employees in the start-up and expansion phases and they promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  As locally based enterprise development agencies, the boards are well positioned to meet the needs of the local economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_652">The main focus of the CEBs is on the micro-enterprise sector and will remain so for the foreseeable future.  The eligibility criteria under which they operate and the range of financial and non-financial instruments available to their clients have been very effective tools in the development of the micro-enterprise sector in Ireland since the inception of the CEBs and have enabled the CEBs to provide targeted assistance to the micro-enterprise sector, with excellent results.  While it is acknowledged that there will be differences in requirements in the areas served by the various CEBs, my Department is satisfied that the current arrangements for eligibility criteria have generally allowed sufficient latitude to individual CEBs to respond to the needs in their own areas.  While CEBs are not in a position to allocate direct grant assistance to companies with more than ten employees, they are permitted to provide indirect assistance such as advice, mentoring and a broad range of training programmes, the value of which should not be underestimated.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">The budget allocation to the CEBs has increased steadily over the last few years, and the 2009 allocation announced in the recent budget represents a 16% increase in the capital allocation over 2008.  This is against a background of savings in other areas of Government activity and is a clear acknowledgement and endorsement of the importance of the boards and of the need that exists for their services, particularly in the current economic climate.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_226">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_654">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I think I will be pushing an open door as far as he is concerned because he comes from a business background.  Notwithstanding the 16% increase in capital funding, which I acknowledge is significant, is it not a fact that the CEBs' budgets for last year had been expended by last April, leaving them without a penny to give out in capital at a vital time?  They have had nothing between then and the recent budget announcement.  Their funding has been inadequate and the demand for funding from new and expanding businesses far exceeds the available funds.  That is a fact.  If fuller funding was made available — the extra 16% is a help — there is no doubt it would result in a greater number of business development opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">The Minister mentioned the mentoring role.  Would he agree the demand for mentoring and information technology support programmes is very high and that these have a major and immediate impact on business growth, but that budget constraints mean the CEBs are not able to meet the demand?  These supports are not available on a year-round basis, notwithstanding what the Minister of State said, and this hinders the growth of small businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has imposed quotas in the allocations of county enterprise boards, and the allocation of the measure 1 budget is restricted by this.  Maximum amounts of 25% and 10% of the budget must go towards employment grants and feasibility study grants, respectively, while 30% of grants awarded must be repaid.  Would the Minister of State agree that these quotas are not conducive to small business development and that county enterprise boards should be allowed to facilitate customer needs and not be restricted by meeting quotas?  It is time to tackle the issue of refundable aid.  All recipients of refundable aid must repay 30% of the grants they received to the enterprise board, and this significantly reduces the attractiveness of the grant and increases the level of administration required.  Alternative grant aid agencies are not obliged to operate in this manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">I hear what the Minister is saying with regard to businesses with ten or more employees, but he is a business person and he knows himself how critical ten employees are in any area.  Would he accept there is a critical gap in the level of service provision to businesses with ten or more employees serving the domestic market?  No agency has responsibility for development and there are no opportunities for business within this category to receive any financial support towards their expansion or development.  These are the businesses that fall between two stools and I have advocated their cause.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">I have one final question before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle stops me.  The small business forum has recommended that enterprise boards be a "first-stop shop" for all small business needs and take primary responsibility for information dissemination.  This has yet to be implemented.  The existence of a single source for obtaining business legislation, start-up information, training, advice, mentoring and finance would be helpful to all new business owners and would use the expertise contained in enterprise boards to maximum effect.  Would the Minister of State agree this is fairly important?</p>

            <from>Deputy John McGuinness</from>
            <p eId="para_662">There is a lot in what the Deputy is saying.  I suggest it is time we had a full and broad discussion at the committee of which he is Chairman, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, about enterprise boards, the SME sector and so on, and how we are engaging with them.  It should be remembered that from 1993 to 2007 almost €190 million was given out to the boards in grants.  There has been significant demand and they are meeting the demand for mentoring, further education, capital grants, refundable loans and all the rest of it.  The increase of 16% will undoubtedly help them.  There are now new demands on those boards.  I have asked officials within my Department to consider the activities of the boards and to engage with them to try to understand what is now needed in our new economic circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">Deputy Penrose asked about businesses with more than ten employees.  It should also be remembered that Enterprise Ireland is now responsible for the boards, and the combination of the boards and Enterprise Ireland offers seamless support for the SME sector, from micro-enterprises to businesses with more than ten employees and export companies.  An effort will be made to help these export companies grow and to engage with the companies that are employing more than ten people to see how we can be of assistance to them.  As I said in my initial reply, mentoring, advice, further education and such support is as vital to these companies as finance, particularly now.  In the context of the overall operation of the boards, I am happy with their performance, but there is perhaps a need for political debate at a committee meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">There is a misunderstanding out there, and I would like to correct the Deputy's assertion that there was no funding from the boards from June onwards.  That is not true.  At the end of last year we reallocated some of the money that was not being spent under the various measures because there were different demands within the local economies for certain enterprise boards, and they must respond accordingly.  They have never been unable to respond because of a lack of support from the Department or from Enterprise Ireland.  It is a new scene out there.  It is being reflected upon and new measures will be introduced if necessary.  The boards are working well.  I meet them on a regular basis and engage with them and I am open to a full discussion, as I said, at the committee.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_665">I will certainly take up that suggestion and invite the Minister of State to the committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">I was given a reply to a parliamentary question which stated that seven boards did not have a penny after last April or May.  Either that reply was right or I am wrong.  However, we will leave that.  Would the Minister agree that in these changed economic times, enterprise boards should be in a position to offer higher rates of grant aid to businesses in higher potential growth areas, for example, the alternative energy sector, the IT sector, health management and areas of scientific development?  At present there is no added incentive they can offer to anybody who displays exceptional entrepreneurship in these areas, although they offer the possibility of creating significant employment.  Could we ask Forfás or another agency or economic forecaster to indicate what types of enterprise should receive additional support?  There is an opportunity there, particularly in these straitened economic times.</p>

In addition, we need to consider new green technologies and companies associated with these because that is where new jobs will be created in future.</p>

            <from>Deputy John McGuinness</from>
            <p eId="para_674">The collection of taxes and the issue of attachment orders are the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is therefore not appropriate for me to comment on the execution of, or the administrative arrangements applying to attachment orders.</p>
            <p eId="para_675">Neither the Tánaiste nor I have had discussions with the Revenue Commissioners or with the Department of Finance in respect of attachment orders nor are we working on any proposals relating to attachment orders.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">On a broader front, the Tánaiste has had discussions with ISME and SFA, and I also met the SFA last week on a range of issues, including access to finance, which are impacting on SMEs arising from the current economic difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">Discussions between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan and discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance at official level, have focused on addressing difficulties arising in accessing bank credit and ensuring that the banking system continues to play an appropriate role in supporting the SME sector.  Over the past week, there have been several announcements by Irish banks of making special funding available to SMEs.  In addition, as recently confirmed by the European Investment Bank, several Irish banks are in contact with the EIB seeking to draw down funding available under the EIB's €30 billion fund for assisting small and medium size enterprises.  The EIB has anticipated that funding will probably be drawn down during the first quarter of 2009.  I welcome these positive developments which should facilitate greater availability of finance to the SME sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">All taxpayers and businesses have an obligation to meet their tax liabilities in a timely manner.  A delay in the collection of revenues due impacts on the level and timeliness of financial resources available to the Government and facilitates those who, by withholding tax payments and using those moneys to improve cash flow, attempt to gain unfair competitive advantage.  The Revenue Commissioners only resort to attachment orders in respect of taxpayers who purposely default in their payment obligations.  The average number of attachment orders for the three-year period 2005 to 2007, was 2,269, in the context of 250,000 small enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">The Revenue Commissioners' consistent message to taxpayers who experience a problem in meeting their tax obligations is to contact Revenue at the earliest possible time to work towards resolving the issue, therefore avoiding the necessity of deploying collection enforcement measures.  The specific question of attachment orders did not arise in recent discussions between the Tánaiste and ISME and the Small Firms Association.</p>

We have business people and also ISME ringing us about this issue.  The threat of attachment orders is preventing banks from giving overdrafts to certain businesses.  I will explain the reason to the Ministers, if they regard this as complicated.</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
            <p eId="para_684">It is not a different question.  I am glad to see it only concerns 2,200.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, has been in business and so he will understand the threat of attachment orders.  If an attachment order is put on a business, the Revenue can step in and clear out that business account, including any overdraft facility.  Therein lies the problem and it is another reason, along with many others, some of the banks will not give overdrafts.  I ask the Minister of State to talk to the Minister about it and check it out to see if the arrangements can be changed.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">The Minister of State referred to the payment of taxes to Revenue.  It is a major issue when Revenue acts in a heavy handed manner and this is happening in the case of some businesses.  Revenue is looking for the money too quickly.  We are now in very different economic circumstances.  The UK tax authorities seem to have recognised this and have put in place a special business and support service to deal with this situation.  If businesses are under pressure making their repayments the UK authorities talk to them and arrange longer term payments with interest charged; it is not for free.  They are doing something about it whereas I am being contacted by business people on a daily basis who are being put under pressure to make payments to the Revenue.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">Deputy McGuinness is a Minister who can talk to the Department of Finance.  Will he ask the Revenue Commissioners to show a little common sense?  If somebody owes €60,000 or €80,000 to the Revenue, I agree he or she should pay it if possible but if the person goes bankrupt in the attempt this will cost the State much more this year and in future years, in terms of lost jobs and lost taxes.  This would amount to a hell of a lot more than €60,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">Will the Minister of State give this question some consideration?  It is a reasonable question and it is down for a reason.  I remind the Tánaiste and other Ministers that I do not make these things up.  Our counterparts in other countries show a bit of leniency in these times and help business during economic hard times rather than putting pressure on them.  The threat of these attachment orders is a very serious threat.</p>

            <p eId="para_688">I understand that but I must explain to the Deputy that when Revenue comes before the Committee of Public Accounts, one will not meet a better organisation for explaining itself.  It has been explained many times to me as a businessman, to the Committee of Public Accounts and to everybody else in business, that if a person has difficulty with paying taxes, the Revenue does not just drop on one's house overnight; it is normally a build-up over a period of time——</p>

            <p eId="para_691">I am not lecturing the Deputy.  He has given his side of the story which is not completely accurate.  If people engage with Revenue they can actually work their way out of the problem.  I have found Revenue to be flexible within the framework when dealing with these situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">On the question of attachment orders, a whole process leads up to the application of an attachment order.  The company in question is written to and is engaged with by the Revenue which discusses the issue with the company.  Revenue encourages the company or individual to settle before it ever becomes heavy handed.  Even prior to the situation becoming, as the Deputy describes it, "a bit heavy handed", an authorised senior manager must be engaged to apply the attachment order.  The figures dating back to 2005 are roughly the same, ranging around 2,200.  I know this is a difficult time for businesses in terms of meeting all their obligations but any company facing a difficulty with payment of taxes should, before it becomes serious, ask their accountants to contact the Revenue Commissioners and work their way out of it.</p>

I agree with the Minister of State that the Revenue Commissioners are normally very reasonable and very easy to deal with when it comes to organising repayments.

Businesses are under enough pressure from everybody else and they do not need the authorities making life difficult for them.</p>

            <p eId="para_710">The significant allocations in the Department's Estimates for 2009 will ensure that it continues to build on this strategy for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">Enterprise Ireland is responsible for supporting the development of Irish companies with ambitions to grow in world markets.  Many of its client companies are small to medium in size.  Enterprise Ireland recognises the varied challenges facing such companies in the context of the changing economic environment and partners with companies to address their needs in a holistic manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">Attractive BES and seed capital schemes contribute to the provision of capital investment across a range of small and medium-sized enterprises.  In addition to this, Enterprise Ireland is directly involved in venture capital initiatives also attracting investment for businesses.  As a result of the Government's investment of €175 million channelled through Enterprise Ireland, seven new venture capital funds have raised over €500 million which is available to invest in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">Also funded through the Department, the 35 county and city enterprise boards provide support to small businesses or microenterprises with ten employees or fewer.  County and city enterprise board funding will increase next year by almost €3 million, 9%, to €34.8 million, representing a further indication of the Government's commitment to supporting this sector of business.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">FÁS through its one step up programme is encouraging employees to increase their competency levels and promoting an ethos of lifelong learning in the workplace.  Its key intervention in this regard is the competency development programme.  It offers workers different types of training programmes directed at various skill levels across major economic sectors.  These training programmes are available to employees of small and medium-sized enterprises.  FÁS also has a number of other training programmes aimed at upskilling small and medium-sized enterprises, namely, Skillnets and the strategic alliance programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">The Government has also made considerable progress on the implementation of the small business forum report's recommendations.  This progress is reflected through a substantial package of financial measures and schemes introduced to assist the sector over the past two years, including fiscal measures in the 2007 and 2008 Finance Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">Small and medium-sized enterprises are central to our economic development and the range of measures and supports outlined above will continue to help the sector adapt to the current economic climate.  These measures will be kept under review to ensure that they remain appropriate to the current circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">In our Department, we will continue to remain in regular contact with the Department of Finance and will ensure that the issue of availability of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises is kept under constant review.  We will also continue to consult with ISME and SFA on all issues impacting on small businesses and we welcome their continued valuable input.</p>

            <p eId="para_719">The Minister of State is aware that up to 250,000 small and medium-sized enterprises provide 800,000 jobs.  While foreign direct investment is important for Ireland, small and medium-sized enterprises are the lifeblood of most areas, particularly rural areas.  Is the Minister of State aware of people's concerns of a significant drain on the retail sector that will take place after Christmas?  I am talking about the real businesspeople who I meet in towns and villages.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">In the past, banks lent irresponsibly to builders who now cannot pay.  The banks are squeezing other borrowers relentlessly to increase their reserves.  Viable small and medium-sized enterprises are threatened by the unwillingness of the banks to lend.  It is not because these businesses are at a risk of failure, but because the banks are desperately trying to attract deposits rather than give loans.  These are profitable small and medium-sized enterprises which do not have the money to pay creditors.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">Is the Minister of State aware that some businesses are afraid to take on too many creditors in case they are charged with reckless trading.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, would know of this.  If a trader takes on credit and cannot pay for it down the line, he or she will have to answer questions somewhere else under company law.  There is a great fear among small and medium-sized enterprises that they could be charged with reckless trading in such cases.  That is why credit is important to them.  They are profitable businesses but they will be squeezed out of existence.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">Access to the €15 billion in funds from the European Investment Bank came into operation in September.  It is now nearly Christmas, three months later, and the banks still have not tapped into this fund.  Why?  Has any Minister asked the banks why?  Is it because the banks will not get enough in management and banking charges?  Will the banks deprive small businesses of the opportunity of survival?  The financial institutions guarantee was given by the Dáil.  What was asked in return?  That the banks would save our 250,000 small and medium-sized enterprise by ensuring enough liquidity and cash to go around for them to meet their day-to-day commitments.  It is time for the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to call in the banks to tell them they have a role to play as active participants in getting us all over this economic hump.</p>

        <b>Deputy Denis Naughten</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         the action she is taking to protect the exploitation of migrant workers against employers breaching employment law; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [45385/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_265">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment  (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_731">I am conscious of the need for vigilance against the exploitation of vulnerable workers, including migrant workers.  It is important to bear in mind that migrant workers can, and do, obtain the full benefits and protection of Irish labour law.  Naturally, unscrupulous employers may try to take advantage of those in a vulnerable position.  However, the Government will not stand aside while employers try to gain unfair competitive advantage by short-changing workers on their entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">The foundation for the protection of vulnerable workers, including migrants, is the existing strong legislative base underpinning employment rights in Ireland which has been built upon by successive Governments.  This includes the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Payment of Wages Act 1991.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">There is also a code of practice on engagement of domestic staff in private houses, introduced in May 2007.  It emphasises that employees in other people's homes have an equal entitlement to the employment rights and protections available to any other employee.  It highlights several of these rights and includes provisions relating to protections that have particular relevance to these employers and employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">The Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 will further strengthen the protective framework.  The Bill, which is on the Order Paper, is being finalised in consultation with stakeholders.  I have requested the Department to ensure Second Stage will be taken early in the next parliamentary session.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">In addition to a strong legislative foundation, there is highly effective industrial relations machinery through which to process claims by employees with grievances, including rights commissioners, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  We have strengthened inspection and enforcement mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">Recent media coverage of abuses were a timely reminder of why the Government set up the National Employment Rights Authority as a key outcome of the social partnership process.  The issues highlighted in the media are disturbing.  However, these issues are not unknown to us.  In over 20,000 workplace inspections so far this year, the authority has determined an average breach rate of 21%.  It has had considerable success since it started operations in 2007 in ensuring abuses of workers rights and entitlements will not go unchecked.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">However, no matter how efficient an inspectorate we have, not every case of exploitation will be caught.  That is why one of the best defences we have against abuse of workers is good quality information and ease of access to redress — both of which will empower the individual vulnerable worker to take the matter further.  Information and good communication of workers' rights is a key element of employment rights compliance.  Great emphasis is put on this by NERA, which reproduces its employment rights information in 12 languages and has 80 labour inspectors currently active who are skilled in foreign languages.  These efforts are complemented greatly by the contribution that is made by the social partners — both trade unions and employers — as well as the established employment rights bodies to greater awareness of responsibilities and rights in the workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">The ability to prosecute employers who do not comply with the law is also a necessary tool in ensuring that employees statutory employment rights are respected and NERA has such a remit.  In 2007, NERA referred 98 cases to the Chief State Solicitor's office for prosecution with 80 prosecution cases commenced to date in 2008.</p>

            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_740">Anyone who watched the "Prime Time Investigates" report last week was appalled at what it showed happening in some workplaces.  Does the Minister of State agree that because our economy is contracting, employers, desperate to make savings, will be under pressure to exploit migrant workers?  Does he agree the exploitation of these workers is not just undercutting Irish jobs, but also responsible employers trying to employ people in line with existing employment legislation?</p>
            <p eId="para_741">How many labour inspectors have been appointed?  The Employment Law Compliance Bill was published on 13 March 2008 but the Minister of State claims it will at least be February of next year before Second Stage is even debated.  Why has there been a delay of 12 months in debating and putting this legislation in place?</p>
            <p eId="para_742">Does the Minister of State agree the National Employment Rights Authority needs to increase fines and provide for more serious penalties for employers who blatantly break employment legislation?  That cannot happen without primary legislation being put in place.  What has the Minister of State been at that he has not brought in this legislation yet?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_267" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_743">The Deputy is correct that when there is a change in the economic environment, pressures are on.  We do not anticipate the labour inspectors taking it any easier.  They have been enforcing employment legislation and have taken several prosecutions.  The Chief State Solicitor's office has been brought in to ensure prosecutions are taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">In the context of the recent media coverage of the haulage industry, it is important that the National Employment Rights Authority enforces the payment of the fines side of the legislation.  The Road Safety Authority must enforce other aspects of the legislation referred to in the "Prime Time Investigates" programme.  No collective agreements apply to the haulage industry as the minimum wage is the baseline in that sector.  NERA is enforcing payment to ensure unscrupulous employers are found out.  Considerable amounts of arrears have also been collected.  I get representations from all sides of the House in the context of NERA being over-vigilant.  We have 81 labour inspectors on the ground ensuring that employment law is complied with.  I will not stand for employers using the downturn in the economy to potentially exploit Irish workers or people here on work permits.  NERA is vigilant in that area.</p>

          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_268">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_745">I accept the point made by the Minister of State.  On some occasions NERA can deal with minor, technical breaches but I refer to blatant flouting of the law.  Why are we still nine inspectors short, some 12 months after they were supposed to be put in place?  In light of the comments of the Minister of State on the "Prime Time Investigates" programme to the effect that road traffic legislation is not the responsibility of his Department, are the joint labour teams that were to be up and running set up?  Are there plans to include the Department of Transport or the Road Safety Authority, RSA, in those joint investigation teams?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_269" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_746">In my first reply I failed to refer to the employment law compliance Bill.  It will be published in the early stages of the next parliamentary session.  Labour inspectors can go about their business because they are set up on an interim basis and have all the statutory supports in terms of enforcing employment rights legislation.  They are out and about in an effective manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">Last June, prior to the "Prime Time Investigates" report, NERA met with the RSA to discuss areas where the bodies could mutually accommodate each other.  That will continue and NERA will be involved in joint inspections in the context of the RSA, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  These issues are occurring on a continual basis.  NERA has taken prosecutions and has uncovered breaches of terms and conditions and arrears have been collected on behalf of workers who did not receive the full entitlement of pay and conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_751">I thank the Tánaiste for the answer.  It is fair to say a decision has yet to be made on that matter.  It was important to have a deal at Aer Lingus.  Unions and employers have come together to make an agreement that I hope will save the airline and allow it to continue as an independent airline.  I have a concern that the taxpayer might effectively subsidise bogus redundancy arrangements whereby someone resigns from a job, receives a redundancy payment for having done so and reapplies for the same or a similar job in the same organisation with different terms and conditions.  The taxpayer is then hit for that.  We talk about the race to the bottom in Ireland.  Should unions and employers wish to negotiate a reduction in pay and conditions it is a matter for them.  I would not like to see the taxpayer subsidising such an arrangement.  Given the Tánaiste's answer, I have a concern that Aer Lingus employees would believe that, based on the assurances given by Aer Lingus and the unions, they will not be taxed on these redundancy payments.  From the Tánaiste's answer, that seems uncertain in some cases at least.</p>

            <p eId="para_752">There is no uncertainty on the basis that the application is not with me at this moment.  There are set procedures under the Redundancy Payment Act and, to ensure we have final determination arising from the issues raised by Deputy Varadkar, where there are concerns on adjudication the Employment Appeals Tribunal is used for decision making.  There has been no decision and I cannot give a preliminary decision on the basis that there is no application.

The matter of workers' rights and statutory supports was raised a few minutes ago.  Equated to this is a balance given the difficulties we are working within.  The role of social partners in the context of economic recovery and difficulty is of major importance.  Working with social partners will benefit the outcome of the economy and, most particularly, some trying issues that face us all.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_284" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_767">I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 93 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_768">The number of employment rights inspections, visits or calls undertaken by the inspection services of the National Employment Rights Authority in the year to the end of November 2008 was 26,787.  During the same period in 2007 some 12,369 inspections, visits or calls were undertaken.  Of the 26,787 inspections, visits or calls to the end of November 2008, breaches were detected in 4,407 cases.  In the same period in 2007 breaches were detected in 2,290 cases.  To the end of November 2008, €2.34 million in underpayment of wages due to employees has been recovered by the NERA inspection services compared to €2.48 million for the corresponding period in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">The outputs and outcomes to date in 2008 reflect the focused and targeted activities being undertaken by NERA in respect of employment rights promotion and compliance and the increased number of NERA inspectors.  The number of inspections carried out in respect of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 during which breaches of the Act were detected and the number of prosecutions initiated is as follows.  In 2006, 2,002 inspections were undertaken; in 104 cases breaches were detected and in one case a prosecution was initiated.  In 2007, 1,942 inspections were undertaken; in 192 cases breaches were detected and no prosecutions were initiated.  In 2008, 2,979 inspections have been undertaken to 30 November; in 258 cases breaches have been detected and in two cases prosecutions have been initiated.  In one case, at the commencement of the trial, the parties entered into a compromise agreement and the prosecution was withdrawn on the direction of the District Court judge.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">NERA undertook a targeted campaign, which focused on compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 between 14 April and 11 May 2008.  Such campaigns, accompanied by awareness and promotional activities, are a significant feature of NERA's employment rights compliance and information strategy.  The primary role of the authority in the case of breaches of employment rights legislation is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including redress for the employees concerned and payment of any arrears due to those employees.  Employers rectify breaches of employment law and pay under payments of wages due to employees without prosecution in the majority of cases.  However, the authority reserves the right to initiate prosecutions in respect of breaches of employment legislation.  Rights commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_771">I accept that and I understand why there are not many prosecutions.  Once the initial breach is detected, negotiations are entered into and matters are resolved.  Is the Minister of State concerned there will be more pressure on wage structures in 2009 because of the economic downturn?  Is there a forum for discussion under Towards 2016 between the social partners to ensure the minimum wage will at least be paid?  Are discussions taking place regarding another matter relating to the hotel industry, which we brought to the Minister of State's attention?  Will he update the House about this matter, to which he obliquely referred earlier?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_286" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_772">A procedure is in place for striking the minimum rate.  The transitional agreement under Towards 2016 was not agreed.  ICTU has been in contact with the Labour Court requesting that it set up the procedure of striking a rate.  The court has contacted the social partners and asked them for their observations, which must be submitted prior to Christmas week.  The court will then adjudicate on them, following which I will be handed the unenviable task of accepting, rejecting or amending them.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">With regard to the joint labour committees, JLCs, in the hotel and catering industries, we have set in motion the amalgamation of the two catering JLCs — Dublin and the rest of the country.  They met last Friday and they have more or less agreed the procedure.  I requested the Labour Relations Commission to appoint a chairman so that everything can be done as quickly as possible.  It is up to the members of the JLCs to agree rates, pay and conditions at the end of the day.  Everybody accepts the catering and hotel sector are facing pressures and challenges.  IBEC and ICTU are in discussions regarding the hotel sector because everybody acknowledges the pressures in both the broader economy and, in particular, in that sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">I am concerned about breaches of the minimum wage legislation.  Whether people like it, it is the minimum wage.  The Parliament and the social partners have agreed this is the minimum amount to which an employee is entitled for a fair day's work.  Most Members will support that ethos.  NERA is targeting compliance with the legislation to ensure the most vulnerable are paid that rate and, more important, are paid arrears.</p>

            <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_775">Following the "Prime Time Investigates" programme recently, which appeared to reveal a significant number of serious breaches of legislation in both the restaurant sector and the road haulage industry, will the Minister of State target the inspectors at these sectors to establish what is going on and to tidy them up since they must account for significantly more breaches than other sectors?</p>
            <p eId="para_776">Will the Employment Law Compliance Bill make provision for on-the-spot fines or something more immediate to deal with these cases?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_288" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_777">The "Prime Time Investigates" programme highlighted two issues — exploitation in the context of pay and conditions and breaches of the Road Traffic Acts.  The national minimum wage regulates payment in the transport sector because there are no collective agreements, joint industrial councils or joint labour committees in the sector and, therefore, NERA is focused on that.  I do not instruct the authority on what it should do but officials carry out risk assessments and profiles of industries, engage in targeted campaigns in several ways, including education and promotion and informing employers of their obligations and employees of their entitlements and rights and they undertake targeted inspections in particular areas, as outlined in reply to previous parliamentary questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">The Employment Law Compliance Bill is still under discussion with stakeholders.  While it was published in March 2008, further discussions have taken place.  Stakeholders had concerns in the context of the transitional agreement under Towards 2016 and we are trying to accommodate everybody so that we can achieve as much consensus as possible.  The Bill will be introduced in the House early in the new session.  I am sure there will be a lively debate on it and there will be a great deal of support among parties for it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_779">When will there be a full complement of inspectors in the labour inspectorate?  The Government signed up to this in the previous partnership agreement but a new agreement has come into force since.  The Minister of State said the new legislation to put NERA on a statutory footing cannot be implemented because of the lack of agreement to date with the social partners, yet when there is agreement on an issue, the Government cannot deliver on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">Are there plans to establish cross-departmental labour investigation teams similar to those proposed by Deputy Morgan for the transport sector?  The "Prime Time Investigates" programme also exposed the flouting of tax laws.  It is critically important to have that mechanism up and running as soon as possible so that a co-ordinated approach can be adopted on this issue.</p>

            <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher</from>
            <p eId="para_781">The Deputy has raised the issue repeatedly for the past year.  We are living up to our commitments under Towards 2016.  A total of 81 labour inspectors are in place and no Deputy can deny they have been on the ground enforcing pay and conditions under the Protection of Young Persons  (Employment) Act 1996, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Payment of Wages Act 1991.  Inspectors are out and about.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">With regard to cross-departmental enforcement, NERA was in contact with the Road Safety Authority, RSA, in June prior to the "Prime Time Investigates" programme to ascertain where they could complement each other.  The authority will also increase co-operation with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue.  The Employment Law Compliance Bill will also contain measures to ensures that happens.  NERA will also be responsible for ensuring compliance with the work permits regime.  Inspectors will be at the coalface and there will be full cross-agency support, for example, with the Garda on work permits, the Revenue, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the RSA.</p>

            <from>Deputy John McGuinness</from>
            <p eId="para_792">The Deputy will appreciate that I have no role or function in the day to day operations of Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development.  My Department has responsibility for ensuring that corporate governance procedures, systems of financial control and reporting relationships are in place within those organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">Both Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development have confirmed that they operate in accordance with the framework code of best practice set out in the code of practice on the governance of State bodies.  The code demands that boards "introduce controls to prevent fraud including adequate controls to ensure compliance with prescribed procedures in relation to claiming of expenses for business travel."  Each year both agencies confirm in their annual reports that they are in compliance with that code.  Additionally, I receive a separate report from their chairpersons affirming that they are in compliance with payment of expenses to the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">I have been advised by Enterprise Ireland that it has taken steps to ensure an appropriate control environment is in place by establishing formal procedures through various committee functions to monitor the activities and safeguard the assets of the organisation, clearly defining and documenting management responsibilities and powers and developing a strong culture of accountability across all levels of the organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">Enterprise Ireland has an internal audit department that operates in accordance with the internal audit charter approved by the audit committee of the board.  This committee meets on a quarterly basis to review reports prepared by internal audit and other departments.  The audit committee reports regularly to the board on the matters that it has considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">Enterprise Ireland observes the Department of Finance guidelines on public procurement.  The organisation has a comprehensive purchasing procedures manual which ensures compliance with purchasing guidelines and legislation for both national and European tendering.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">Enterprise Ireland's advertising spend relates exclusively to its public calls for proposals and publicising applications to its three national competitive funds for Irish enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">Shannon Development has confirmed to me that, on the basis of the systems and processes in place, all appropriate procedures for financial reporting, internal audit, procurement and asset disposals are being carried out by Shannon Development, that the company has not engaged in excess expenditure on advertising, foreign travel, events, and corporate entertainment and that the company is fully compliant with public procurement procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">With regard to foreign travel, I have been assured that both agencies comply with Department of Finance regulations.  In addition, in the light of recent concerns in this regard, the Department of Finance's main guidelines on foreign travel have again been circulated to all agencies and they have been asked to confirm by 15 December that the guidelines are being complied with.  The situation will be monitored under existing liaison arrangements between the Department and Shannon Development.</p>

            <p eId="para_801">I look forward to reading the balance of the reply.  The purpose of this question is to ensure that given the poor oversight of FÁS actions are being taken by Government to ensure we do not have similar activities in other agencies.  I am happy to hear that work is being done in this regard.  I am not aware of any waste or particular allegations with regard to these agencies but a cursory reading of their budgets shows one very obvious expense which is the extent to which all of these agencies have heavy staff costs and overheads.  More than two thirds of Enterprise Ireland's budget goes on staff costs and overheads and less than one third is spent on grants to business.  This is not to state there is impropriety or wrongdoing.  Does the Minister of State share my concern that all of these agencies seem to have phenomenal costs with regard to overheads and staff relative to their core work which relates to support for business?</p>

            <p eId="para_802">With regard to Shannon Development the same applies.  We receive reports and it is monitored.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">Enterprise Ireland has 31 offices throughout the world so its activities must be taken into account with regard to its cost base and what value we get for it.  With regard to missions abroad and what they achieve for business in Ireland I believe they give value for money in this context and I have quoted these figures previously, including €65 million in China and €25 million in Dubai.  It must be measured against activities and its level of presence in other economies and throughout the world.  In the context of public sector reform I am sure the numbers will be examined.  My views on this are known and I will continue to express them and hope we will have an efficient and professional public service for the future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_823">I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 74 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">In general, a redundancy arises where an employee's job ceases to exist, and the employee is not replaced for such reasons as rationalisation, reorganisation, insufficient work available, the financial state of the firm and company closures.</p>
            <p eId="para_825">Redundancy is determined in line with strict criteria set down in the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007 on the basis of claims submitted to my Department after the event of the redundancy.  Redundancy is therefore determined having regard to the terms of the legislation and on the basis of fact and law.  Where a genuine redundancy is deemed to exist, it is a legal entitlement, not a matter of discretion.  Thus, in considering applications for payment, full account would be taken of the factual circumstances giving rise to the redundancies in parallel with the legislative provisions to establish the fit with the redundancy payments scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">The legislation enables the Minister to refer particular cases to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a determination to establish the eligibility of cases under redundancy legislation.  Therefore, while a preliminary view can be formed in advance as to the chances of any particular set of circumstances fitting the terms of the redundancy payments scheme, it is just that, a preliminary view.  The actual decision will only be taken after the fact.  Any decision will be taken in light of the circumstances that have transpired, in full knowledge of the terms of the redundancies offered, the pattern of take up, the nature of the changes in the workplace and so on.</p>

            <p eId="para_830">An approach was made to the Department seeking a preliminary view but it was on the basis of the initial proposal that was brought forward.  As the Deputy knows, we moved beyond this initial proposal.  Legal advice has been sought on the basis of giving a preliminary review but as the Deputy knows it is not legally binding and therefore we are not in a position to give a full determination.  At the same time, it is important to state that the preliminary view was given on the initial application or consideration of the first application and then it was changed.  As I stated and as has been indicated and there has been a great deal of interaction between the social partners and ourselves, it is only a preliminary view that can be given.  If it is straightforward it can go through the normal processes but for absolute clarity the matter would need to go before the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>

As I stated, I must be careful that it is only on the basis of a preliminary view and does not have a legal understanding which is provided for within the legislation.  It will also be based on what claims will be made.</p>

         her views on the impact the reduction of VAT in Northern Ireland and the increase here will have on the retail and services sector in the Border counties; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_326" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_834">While the United Kingdom VAT reduction will have some effect on price differentials between UK and Irish goods, the reduction in the value of sterling will have a greater impact on the price of goods in the North than the VAT differential.  Moreover, as the British Government is increasing excise duties on alcohol, cigarettes, petrol and diesel to offset the 2.5% VAT reduction on these items, the UK budget change will not enhance the attractiveness of these items to cross-Border shoppers.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">In addition, approximately half the value of goods and services purchased in the State are not subject to the standard VAT rate and therefore are unaffected by the recent budget changes in Ireland and the UK.  For example, all Government services, local authorities, hospitals, schools and so on are exempt from VAT.  The majority of foodstuffs, oral medicines, books and children's clothes and shoes come under the zero rate of VAT.  Furthermore, the 13.5% reduced rate of VAT applies to housing, electricity, gas, domestic fuels, restaurant services and labour intensive services such as hairdressing and shoe repair.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">The latest Central Statistics Office bulletin for October shows that consumer prices continue to fall, with overall annual inflation at 4%, down from 4.3% in September.  This compares with an annual rate of 4.2% for the United Kingdom all-items retail price index.  With regard to the retail sector, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment requested Forfás in September to carry out an analysis of the relative cost of doing business in various locations in the Republic, Northern Ireland and Britain.  The Minister has already commenced discussions with a cross-section of retailers on the preliminary findings of the study.  We are committed to promoting competition and raising consumer awareness in order to drive competition for goods and services traded domestically.  We are also tackling administrative burdens with a view to keeping costs for enterprises under control.  Ireland's cost competitiveness is also supported by relatively low taxes on labour and enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">With regard to services, both the services sector and the growing services element within manufacturing companies are vital to the next stage of our economic performance.  We recently carried out an evaluation of the specific needs of the services sector.  The report of the services strategy group, Catching the Wave: A Services Strategy for Ireland, was published on 12 September 2008.  This report will guide the development of our services strategy into the future to exploit the opportunities available in this sector.  A particular focus of the strategy is on locally traded services.  It is increasingly recognised that local services are a significant source of wealth creation and employment in their own right, as well as providing essential underpinning for internationally trading business and for social and cultural development.  My Department is working with the enterprise agencies and with other Departments to progress the implementation of the report's recommendations.</p>

As I observed in my reply, more than 50% of the goods and services traded are not affected by the VAT changes.  It is important to recognise that the depreciation of sterling against the euro is having a significant effect.

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_861">I thank the Deputies for tabling these questions.  I begin by expressing my sympathy and that of the Government to the family and friends of the late Aidan O'Kane.  The Deputies will appreciate that I am greatly constrained in what I can say about the specific tragic incident which gave rise to these questions.  The Garda investigation has reached a stage where it would be inappropriate for me to comment either on the detail surrounding the immediate incident or the circumstances which gave rise to it.  That information will emerge in the fullness of time and we will look to see whether any lessons can be learned from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">As we speak, I understand the Garda has issued a statement that a 16 year old male has been detained in Store Street Garda station.  He will appear at the Dublin juvenile District Court No. 55, and will be charged with a serious offence.  Several other persons remain in custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">All I can say for the present is that this death is deplored by all right minded people.  As I said, our sympathy goes to the family and friends of Mr. O'Kane, as well as to the wider community in East Wall.  I understand the Garda and local community in East Wall work closely together.  We hope this tragic incident will reinforce the determination to continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_864">Without wishing to comment in any way on the specific details of Mr. O'Kane's death, I intend to deal with two general issues raised in the Deputies' questions, namely, gun crime and public disorder.  The stark reality is that there is a growing gun culture in this State which has inevitably had fatal consequences.  I accept entirely that our priority must be to rid our society of illegal handguns.  That has been a priority in Operation Anvil since its inception in 2005.  Under that operation up to 30 November last, over 1,200 firearms had been recovered in Dublin alone and 1,000 in the rest of the country, a total of 2,200 illegally held guns in a relatively short space of time.  The Garda will continue to address relentlessly the issue of illegally held guns.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">The House will be aware that since my appointment I have expressed concern about the number of handguns that have been licensed in this country since 2004.  I am aware the vast majority of licensed firearms holders pursue their interest legitimately.  I am also conscious that many of them deeply resent any connection that is made to the issue of licensed handguns in the context of our crime problem.  However, as Minister with responsibility for justice, I cannot avoid the reality that the overall number of weapons in circulation and the type of those weapons can add to that gun culture.  The specific problem is demonstrated by the fact that 27 licensed handguns have been stolen since 2005 and a further 1,236 other firearms have been stolen during the same period, with a total of 373 recovered.  Members can see that there is an ever increasing gun culture, both licensed and unlicensed, in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">The issue of handguns generally was highlighted by Mr. Justice Peter Charlton in a judgment last July when he said that any reasonable person is entitled to feel alarmed at the proliferation of handguns.  That is the reason I brought forward proposals which include, with limited exceptions relating to Olympic sports, no new licences being issued for handguns and existing licences being renewed only if they meet the requirements of a much more stringent regime.  I hope Members on all sides of the House will support these proposals when I bring them before the House.  They are not designed needlessly to interfere with the rights of sporting enthusiasts, but to recognise the specific dangers that guns pose.  I refer Members to what the Garda Commissioner said to the Committee of Public Accounts about the difficulty he has on the one hand trying to get illegally held guns out of the system while, on the other hand, licensing the same types of handguns under the lacuna that has arisen as a result of a number of court cases in recent times.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">While a <i>de facto</i> ban on new handgun licences is already in place, my proposals will be given legislative form in the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which I will bring before the House early in the new year.  That Bill will also tackle comprehensively the issue of airsoft guns.  I wish to have an outright ban on these guns and to make possession of them in public a serious offence.  The proliferation of airsoft guns has been brought to my attention by Members on all sides of the House.  The Bill will also contain measures which the Garda Commissioner has suggested for tightening up the law to deal with knives.  I have had many meetings with the Garda Commissioner and Garda senior management on the issue of illegal handguns.  We have a duty to examine the existing licensing arrangements for handguns, which will allow a proliferation of handguns before we have even had an opportunity in the House to state what we believe should be public policy in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">All Members of the House recognise the problems posed for communities by public disorder.  There are groups of youths in many communities whose behaviour has no regard for the rights of others and who can cause considerable distress to their neighbours.  It would be unfortunate, however, in the light of one or a few incidents to characterise all badly behaved young people as potential killers.  Tackling public order issues is a priority for both the Government and the Garda, as is evident from the substantial resources that we continue to commit to front-line policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">Some public comment has been made about the supposed failure of the anti-social behaviour order legislation.  That may be based on a misunderstanding about the procedures set out in that legislation.  It sets out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of the Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract including the child and his or her parents or guardian, referral to the Garda juvenile diversion programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  Moreover, it overlooks the point that the main legislation used by the Garda Síochána in dealing with public order is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">Since 2002, when the Garda introduced Operation Encounter specifically to target anti-social behaviour, over 510,000 such offences have been detected.  Most of these offences, of their nature, are only recorded as a result of Garda enforcement activity and the statistics paint a picture of extensive levels of Garda activity.  I recognise, however, that dealing with public disorder is an issue on which co-operation between gardaí and the local community is absolutely vital.  For that reason I am proceeding with the roll out of joint policing committees following the successful pilot phase.  As a result of the pilot phase, a committee was established in the Dublin City Council area along with further sub-committees in each of the city's five areas.  These committees enable local authority representatives and officials, the gardaí in the area, Oireachtas Members and community interests to get together in a structured way to discuss matters affecting the policing of their areas.  I believe this approach has great potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">The House will appreciate that I have confined myself to dealing with matters for which I have direct ministerial responsibility.  However, we will ignore at our peril the fact that policing and the criminal justice system alone do not tackle all the issues that must be addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_873">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate this matter, in however limited form.  I am also grateful to the Minister for attending.  I join him in expressing my sympathy and that of the Fine Gael Party to the family of the deceased and, indeed, the community of the East Wall area.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">The Minister will be aware that nine months ago, following the savage and brutal murder of two Polish persons in Drimnagh, the House held a day long debate, which was described at the time by Government sources as a watershed.  However, the situation has deteriorated not only in Dublin but also in other urban areas since then.  There is a crisis of confidence with regard to dealing with criminal justice matters in a comprehensive way.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">This is the 20th gun murder so far this year.  The situation is such that urgent and comprehensive action is required.  I share the Minister's view that it would not be appropriate to comment on any matters that might be of evidential value in this case, but a well-respected worker in the inner city area, Fr. Peter McVerry, is on record as saying that guns are freely available to young people in inner city Dublin.  We are not dealing here with legally held and lawfully licensed guns but with young people and illegally held guns.  We are dealing with a society that has given rise to a situation where children as young as ten years of age are engaged in the drug courier business and a 12 year old was recently seen wearing a bullet proof vest as a method of self defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">The gun culture among young people is a very serious problem.  Where are these guns coming from and what is the Minister doing to deal with the issue of illegally held firearms in this city?  What action does he propose to take?</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_877">As I said earlier, the Government put Operation Anvil in place in 2005 and gave the Garda Commissioner substantial resources for it each year since then.  Indeed, at a time when less money is available for next year, I increased the overall budget for Operation Anvil from €20 million to €21 million.  I specifically told the Garda Commissioner that the money had to be earmarked for organised crime and particularly the issue of the illegal gun culture.  Look at the figures for the number of guns seized in the Dublin area.  I have political and policy responsibility but ultimately it is an issue for the Garda, which has the resources.  The gardaí are the people on the front line who have the responsibility of ridding our society of illegally held handguns.  As I stated, the Garda seized 1,200 firearms in the Dublin metropolitan district and made 7,000 arrests for serious offences, including murder, serious assault, robbery and burglary.  Since 2005, approximately 65,000 searches have been carried out and property to the value of €31 million has been recovered.  That is what the Garda is doing on behalf of the State and the Government has provided it with the resources to enable it to perform these functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">Neither the Government nor any Member on any side is complacent about murder.  Nevertheless, crime statistics from the Central Statistics Office show a marked reduction in homicide offences in the third quarter of 2008.  Percentage decreases have been recorded across the spectrum, with the number of murders, cases of dangerous driving leading to death and manslaughter all in decline.  Year-on-year, homicide offences decreased by 50%, with the number of murders declining by 33%.  The Government is not complacent in any shape or form, which is the reason, despite fewer resources, that I specifically earmarked resources for tackling crime, particularly organised crime and the gun culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">Deputy Flanagan continually states that I am concentrating on licensed hand guns.  As he will be aware, however, extremely tough provisions on the possession of illegal firearms, particularly handguns, have been in place since we made changes to the 2006 Act.  Mandatory sentences of ten and five years are in force, depending on the type of offence.  We must go further, particularly in view of comments made by Mr. Justice Peter Charlton in July and, more recently, Mr. Justice George Birmingham, who is not unknown to the Deputy.  The latter, for example, referred to the reason certain people believe they need to have licensed handguns in their possession.  The combination of illegal, licensed and so-called airsoft handguns will quickly give rise to a gun culture.  We need to address this issue quickly.  As policymakers, the Government, Members of the Oireachtas and I, as Minister, have a duty in this respect, which is the reason I asked for support on the issue.  The Deputy should not speak out of both sides of his mouth on this matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_880">Does the Minister accept that a UK-style gun and gang culture has developed in this city and beyond?  Does he also accept that a distinction must be made between violent anti-social behaviour and organised criminal drug gangs?  Has he done an assessment of what impact the reduction in Garda overtime payments by in excess of €20 million will have on dealing with anti-social behaviour?</p>
            <p eId="para_881">Does the Minister accept that we now have proof that young children are drifting out of the education system early and into a life of crime, guns, drugs and violent anti-social behaviour and that this pattern will only be broken by a comprehensive scheme involving his Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Education and Science as well as the Office of the Minister for Children?  Does he accept, for example, that funding for a youth diversion project in the inner city established in response to anti-social behaviour on the Liffey board walk and involving a one-stop-shop was cut by the Health Service Executive earlier this year, leaving people with no alternative other than the attractiveness of a life of crime and anti-social behaviour?</p>
            <p eId="para_882">Is a Cabinet sub-committee involving the Department in place?  Does he accept that the response must involve more than criminal justice and must include action by the Minister's colleagues in the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science as well as agencies such as the HSE?  Until a comprehensive plan by a Cabinet sub-committee is in place, the problem will unfortunately deteriorate.  What is required is a comprehensive plan of action, rather than having mere statements in the House following a tragic event.  We have had these too often and they are insufficient as they do not comply with the service obligation on the House and, specifically, the Minister to deal with this problem.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_352" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_883">While Garda overtime will be reduced next year, one must consider the sizeable number of gardaí recruited in recent years.  Next year alone, Garda numbers will increase from 14,267 to almost 15,000.  These figures do not take into account the substantial civilianisation programme under which 2,600 civilians do office work done previously by gardaí in Garda stations.  The civilianisation process is a response to views expressed by Members from all sides that gardaí must be deployed on the streets.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">The Deputy, who is being political on this matter, should be aware that the number of gardaí will reach 15,000 by the end of 2009, whereas the Fine Gael Party promised in Deputy Kenny's "contract" that it would reach 15,000 by 2012.  If we were to listen to Deputy Richard Bruton on the budget, the cut in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's budget would be larger than the 2.7% reduction introduced in October.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">On youth diversion projects, my Department works on a multi-agency, ongoing basis with a number of agencies, including the Health Service Executive.  The Taoiseach and I regularly attend general security and crime briefings provided by Garda management.  On the specific case in East Wall, as I indicated, it was argued in some quarters that insufficient community gardaí were available.  There are, I believe, 28 or 30 community gardaí attached to Store Street Garda station.  Yesterday, a journalist complimented the Garda on the substantial number of community gardaí in the area.  Four community gardaí are deployed on beat patrol in East Wall on a constant basis.  Three of these are deployed daily between 10 a.m. and 2 a.m. from Monday to Saturday, with two deployed during the same period on Sundays.  The area has a 24-hour armed presence and a community policing mobile patrol car is in operation from 8 p.m. until 5 a.m. every Friday and Saturday night.  Additional pedal cycle patrols are deployed in the area and, arising from its proximity to Dublin Port, checkpoints are regularly conducted in the area between 6 p.m. and midnight by the divisional traffic unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">A number of operations are also in place, one of which, Operation Intent, involves having two public order vans deployed patrolling the immediate area from Thursday to Sunday night from 8 p.m. until 4 a.m.  One sergeant and six gardaí are involved, while plain clothes and uniform patrols are also deployed in the area.  There is, therefore, a substantial Garda presence in the East Wall area.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">The involvement of the Garda in youth diversion projects in the East Wall area is substantial.  Four such projects are funded by my Department with a view to assisting young people and diverting them from crime.  The HAY project in Dunne Street, which operates under Fitzgibbon Street Garda station, had 19 participants in 2007 and received funding of €46,000 for the year.  The project did not have a co-ordinator for most of 2007.  The Swan project in Dunne Street, which operates from Store Street Garda station, also received a substantial funding allocation of €65,500.  The DIME project in Hardwicke Street had 23 participants in 2007 and received annual funding of approximately €100,000.  The NICKOL project in Buckingham Street, which operates under the Fitzgibbon Street Garda district, had 20 participants in 2007 and received a funding allocation of €130,000.  Certain statements are incorrect because gardaí are involved not only in policing, but are also doing substantial work——-</p>

            <p eId="para_894">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing time for private notice questions.  I offer my sympathies to the family of Mr. O'Kane and the community in East Wall.  I know many of the people there very well and often met Mr. O'Kane in the past walking his two dogs at the junction of Shemalier Road and Ravensdale Road, which is near Bargy Road where he was shot.  I compliment the gardaí for the speed with which they investigated the matter and the co-operation they received from the community in East Wall.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">This is an appalling crime.  It is the worst crime that has been committed in my constituency that I know of since I have been in politics and is a new low in anti-social behaviour.  Anti-social behaviour is embedded in certain communities across urban areas, and overflows into many communities in smaller towns and cities in rural areas.  It has been worsening and coarsening over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">There is a question over handguns.  The Minister stated that 1,200 weapons have been seized in the Dublin area, which amounts to 300 per annum over four years and is almost one per day.  Some 1,000  were seized in the rest of the country.  This is a substantial number of guns.  Does the Minister know the breakdown of those between shotguns and handguns?  I understand they are virtually all shotguns.  There is no successful action by the gardaí in the seizure of handguns. From where are they coming?  How are they getting into the possession of the people who use them?  How are they getting into the possession of young people?  Does the Minister have any answers?</p>
            <p eId="para_897">The Minister concluded that there was a significant level of policing in the area.  The 24-hour policing and Thursday to Friday policing to which he referred did not take place in the East Wall area, but in Sheriff Street which is a neighbouring community and not the area we are discussing.  It looks very impressive but the Minister is talking about a no-go area.  There should be no no-go areas anywhere in the city, but that is what it is coming to.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">Operation Anvil should no longer be in existence.  It was set up as an overtime operation because there were not enough gardaí to conduct the business.  We now have almost 15,000 gardaí but Operation Anvil works on the basis of overtime.  Many of the seizures are made during this overtime activity by the gardaí.  This degrades much of the work done by them on a normal basis.  The Minister should have a fresh look at this aspect.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">Regarding anti-social behaviour, there is a serious issue of parental responsibility in the general area.  Other Ministers should be in the House to discuss this matter.  There are youngsters — boys and girls, pre-teens and those in their early and late teens — wandering around at all hours of the day and night with no parental responsibility involved.  It is a matter which must be addressed.  The community policing fora established must be expedited and given more resources because it is necessary to bring the various communities together.  The experience of East Wall is also being felt in many other areas.  There needs to be a cohesive response.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">The gardaí are doing a reasonably good job but they are not responding effectively to the problems now embedded in the area.  Since this situation happened in one area, we warned the Garda it would happen in other areas, and there would be fatalities and injuries.  Unfortunately, we never expected it to happen in the East Wall area.  There is a serious problem.  Weapons are readily available, anti-social behaviour has worsened and there is a coarsening of society with young people being beyond the control of their peers, neighbours and parents.  Unless the situation is addressed comprehensively it can only worsen.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_901">I agree with Deputy Costello on the matter of parental responsibility.  I was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs for five years, from 1997 to 2002.  During that time I was aware of and involved in the build-up of community development projects around the country, and tried to assist disadvantaged geographic areas in particular.  Many issues revolved around responses by multi-agency and non-governmental organisations to try and assist communities with problems such as the ones Deputy Costello enunciated.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">Regarding community policing, I am heartened to see the number of community police is approximately 630, which is something most Deputies would accept is a good change from yesteryear, when gardaí were not as involved in local communities as they have been in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">Deputy Costello raised the issue of overtime.  I do not agree with him.  In any police force, there must be an element of overtime in order to respond to particular events that can arise.  Without it a response would not be possible.  I do not agree that Operation Anvil should cease.  One can earmark money specifically for it when one sees the difficulties in places such as Limerick and Dublin and where there needs to be a specific response over and above normal policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">I do not have the figures on the division of handguns.  A substantial number of the 2,200 guns seized under the operation were handguns.  Operation Anvil is earmarked specifically to target organised crime.  I do not have the figures with me but I can provide them if Deputy Costello tables a parliamentary question.  In yesteryear, when crimes were committed by criminals using firearms, they used sawn-off shotguns.  The advent and availability of the handgun in this country has made matters more difficult for the Garda and has reduced the number of sawn-off shotguns used in robberies.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">The Garda Commissioner has said to me that the ability to conceal a handgun in a pocket or such like is a serious issue.  It recently happened in Dublin, not far from Deputy Costello's area, that the Garda apprehended a person on a bicycle, whom it believed to be on his way to commit a murder and found a handgun strapped to the bicycle seat.  If this House does not take some action, not only on illegal handguns as we have been doing, where we have given the Garda resources to act, but also on the proliferation of handguns generally, we would, as Mr. Justice Peter Charleton has said, be in dereliction of our duty.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">I fully agree with Deputy Costello on the issue of parental responsibility.  We introduced legislation on anti-social behaviour in 2006.  Substantial data is available on its effectiveness.  It takes time for it to become fully effective as a number of procedures must be gone through before ASBOs can be issued.  Additional procedures apply specifically to children.  From the beginning of March 2007 until the end of October this year, 907 warnings were issued to adults, 548 to children, 12 behaviour contracts were entered into between children and their parents and a number of applications were made for ASBOs.  There are probably not as many as people would like but they must go through a procedure over time.  Given this, I have no doubt the number of ASBOs will increase.</p>

            <p eId="para_907">Can the Minister provide further clarification on handguns?  He stated that 2,200 guns were seized, which works out at 550 per annum over four years.  That is a colossal number of weapons.  Do gardaí have any idea where all those weapons came from?  How many of them were licensed?  Why would anybody need to have a licensed handgun, unless he or she is a pistol shooting competitor?  Shotguns are used for hunting, so where are all those handguns coming from?  Is it that the huge amount of drugs coming into the country are accompanied by a supply of handguns?  Is this why they are finding their way to a lower age group?  Does the leadership of the Garda have any opinion on this matter?  There is very little ground for legally held handguns, so where are they all coming from?</p>
            <p eId="para_908">We have already had the appalling vista of endemic gangland crime, as this is the 20th fatal shooting this year.  However, in this case, an innocent victim in the privacy of his own home was targeted following a petty dispute and a handgun was used to kill him.  Nothing that the Minister has said relieves that appalling vista.  How could such a quantity of guns be seized?  What percentage of them would have been legally held?  Is the situation so bad that they are two a penny in this country?</p>

In recent times, it is clear that handguns have been used much more often by criminal gangs, due to the advantages of concealment.  That is why we owe it to ourselves in this House not to allow for policy on the hoof, as per the decision made in 2004 by Judge Maureen Harding Clarke.  I am not criticising the judge, but as a result of that decision, we have gone from a situation where zero handguns were licensed in the State to a situation where 1,800 handguns are now licensed.</p>

            <p eId="para_923">We must look at this from a holistic point of view.  The Garda has been very successful in seizing 2,200 firearms, a large proportion of which would be handguns.  Will we allow the proliferation of licensed handguns to the other side?  Not all illegal handguns are brought in with illegal drug consignments, although gardaí generally come across firearms in those hauls.  It is possible that a large proportion of these illegal handguns are coming across the Border.  It is probably one of the most accessible routes, because most of the ports and airports are manned by security.  The Garda has been extremely successful with these seizures.</p>

There may well be merits in that policy and I look forward to the debate on it.

            <p eId="para_936">In conclusion, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the number of juvenile liaison officers, which is a fact that needs to be addressed.  Juvenile liaison officers assist in providing a service to teenagers who may be about to start a life of anti-social behaviour, or worse.  While I accept the Minister's claim that the Garda has more than 14,000 members, I remind him that it has a mere 100 juvenile liaison officers.  I suggest that there should be a greater concentration of juvenile liaison officers within the force, particularly in areas affected by high levels of anti-social behaviour.  Juvenile liaison officers are effective in those areas where they are working.  I ask the Minister to discuss this matter with the Garda authorities the next time he meets them.</p>

While the main concentration is in this area, we have to deal with other situations as they arise.  I mentioned licensed handguns in the context of one of the issues that has arisen.

While we need specialised gardaí to deal with some issues, it is important to realise that the force also has to look after other policing duties.</p>

          <p eId="para_949">As I said earlier, the withdrawal of the universal entitlement of people over the age of 70 to the medical card will reverse some proven health gains.  This regressive and inhumane measure will reduce the peace of mind of such people.  We are all aware that the decision to remove this entitlement led to a significant expression of outrage on the streets of Dublin some weeks ago.  We owe it to those who travelled from the four corners of Ireland to the Age Action Ireland meeting in a church on Westland Row, and to the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament demonstration outside Leinster House, to fight their cause in this democratic Chamber.  The people of the generation in question paid taxes at a rate that the young earners of today would find unbelievable.  They saved their money for a rainy day.  They did not allow themselves the luxuries people take for granted nowadays, such as holidays and regular changes of home decor.  They are the kind of people who made their own sandwiches and got their water from a tap or a well.  They would have been horrified by the notion of buying bottled water or sandwiches for lunch.  They scrimped and saved their money.  They richly deserve something back from the State because they had to watch as this country's riches were squandered on things like PPARS and electronic voting, with little long-term benefit.  In the health sector, almost €1 billion in taxpayers' money, in the form of tax breaks, is being given to rich people who are being allowed to develop co-located hospitals on public hospital grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">I give the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition Government credit for granting an automatic medical card to everyone over the age of 70.  This decision, which was made in advance of the 2002 general election, was one of the few things done to help elderly people.  It seems that the medical card was granted only for as long as it suited the Government.  When times got tough, the entitlement was removed as part of the first batch of cuts.  Similarly, children in classes of more than 30 pupils and 12 year girls, who had been promised a life-saving vaccine, were among the first to be targeted.  This was done in a budget that we had been led to believe would be framed in a way that would protect the vulnerable.  On the contrary, the vulnerable are taking the brunt of the pain of these cutbacks.  As someone who attended the meetings I have mentioned, I am aware that representatives of the Government were taken aback by the size and vehemence of the protests against this measure.  Having been in government for over 11 years, it is clear that Ministers, in particular, do not realise what is going on in the real world.  They are out of touch.  I would have expected the Green Party members of the Government to have recent memories of what it is like for people with small amounts of money who are about to lose their medical cards.  Instead, the Green Party Ministers were happy to avail of the shelter of the Cabinet.  I accept that a Fianna Fáil backbencher showed the courage to shake the Government out of its complacency and bring about a partial climbdown.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The extent to which the Government is out of touch was made clear when it set punitive income thresholds in the immediate aftermath of the budget.  It subsequently had to provide for four changes to those thresholds in the space of a week.  Yesterday's announcement that recently widowed people will retain their medical cards for three years is a further climbdown.  It will bring relief to a small number of people.  Can the Minister confirm that it is legally possible to apply a different rule to different categories of widows and widowers, depending on how long they have been widowed?  While I accept that she referred to the matter in her speech this morning, I question the legality of the measure that is being introduced.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to that point.  This proposal will introduce a further inequality where single people are concerned.  I have received a number of telephone calls from people who point out that single people have to meet many of the same household expenses as couples — heat, light and mortgage etc. — but no allowance is made for that.  The upper income threshold that applies to them is exactly half of that which applies to couples.  As far as I can tell, this is the only means tested measure where gross income, as opposed to net income, is the applicable criterion.  This is quite unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">I question whether there will be any appreciable saving as a result of this legislation, when the cost of the administration of the means test for the medical card is taken into account.  I am aware that the Minister has disputed the €16 million figure that was mentioned earlier in this debate.  It is certainly not much more than that.  The cost of the administration of the means test needs to be taken into account.  What does the Government intend to do in this context in the future?  The yearly review will not guarantee that the card will not be removed from more and more people in the years to come.  I listened with interest to the Minister's suggestion that there will be an additional 535,000 people over the age of 70 by 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">The Labour Party believes that the principle of universal access should be retained.  Since 2002, we have advocated a system of universal health care, including free access to primary care for all citizens.  The improvement since 2001 in certain statistics relating to older people offers us a snapshot of what such a system could do for the health of the nation.  A study published in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> in 2004 showed that access to the medical card resulted in older people visiting their GPs more often, an increased uptake of the influenza vaccine and a reduction in the percentage of people over the age of 70 who had a disability.  It is not unreasonable to conclude that such improvements have resulted from older people enjoying better access to primary care and improved management of existing health conditions.  There is strong evidence to suggest that men enjoy better health outcomes when they have medical cards.  Many men tend not to visit their GPs for regular check-ups and monitoring of conditions if they do not have medical cards.  In general, they will not visit the doctor unless they have an acute health problem.  It is feasible to suggest that there would be a saving in the overall health budget in the medium term if all people over the age of 70 were to be allowed to keep their medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">At the beginning of my contribution, I mentioned that having a medical card is not just a question of having free access to medication and one's GP.  One can also avail of services like physiotherapy, supplies like incontinence pads and bandages and access to public health nurses.  More than 700 people in acute hospital beds could be looked after in the community if there were places for them.  If people are going to lose their medical cards, it will cause more people to end up in acute beds.  Not having a medical card will mean they will not have access to the support that would allow them to stay in the community.  I know the Minister's policy is that more people should be able to be treated in the community, with which we fully agree.  However, this may just be lip service unless funding is given to community care services.  Taking medical cards from senior citizens will make it more difficult for them to go back into the community because they will not be entitled to the various other supports, which are very important to people in staying in their own homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The Labour Party supports renegotiating the fee for GPs to get the same fee for all medical card patients over 70 irrespective of whether they got it as a result of a means test or a general entitlement.  However, that could have been done any time in the past seven years since the introduction of the free medical card for the over 70s.  It was not necessary to remove the entitlement in order to renegotiate with the GPs.  However, the medical card income thresholds for other people in the community have not been raised for some time.  I urge the Minister to include more people in the medical card scheme right across the age spectrum.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">I refer to some individual cases of which I have become aware.  I have received many phone calls about the loss of the medical card.  There is great anger among senior citizens.  They are not satisfied with the Minister raising the thresholds under pressure.  They want a return of the right they were given.  They are extremely angry that this one benefit they got from the Celtic tiger after paying high taxes all their lives has been taken from them.  One person sold their house in order to raise funds to go into a nursing home.  That person has money in a financial institution as a result of selling the house that has been gradually used in paying for the nursing home over time.  That money would bring the person over the threshold in terms of savings.  Where does that person stand in terms of retaining the medical card?</p>
          <p eId="para_957">A number of people who are living alone have contacted me.  Those individuals need to pay all the kinds of bills a couple must pay.  Some of them are barely over the limit and will lose their medical cards.  I support Deputy Reilly regarding terminally ill people.  While I accept they may be able to get a discretionary medical card, there are genuine cases of people with a terminal illness, which can be very costly, who do not qualify for a medical card.  That is truly inhuman and cruel.  I ask the Minister to address in particular the issue of people who are terminally ill.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">I support what Deputy Noonan said about the letter which I also got from the retired secondary teachers in the constituency we both share.  The Government initially gave the message that this would only affect approximately 5% of the population who were very rich and could well afford to do without a medical card.  However, we are talking about retired teachers, gardaí and nurses as well as people retired from working in the private sector with a limited income.  We are not just talking about people in the very high-income bracket.  We are talking about people who will genuinely struggle and for whom the peace of mind of having the medical card was a great bonus and the loss of which they will feel greatly.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">I question taking medical cards from people who already have them.  I question the legal issues of taking a medical card that somebody has as of right.  In many cases those cards will not expire for another two, three or four years.  Yet those people are expected to hand in their medical cards at the beginning of March.  While I know that is being left to themselves, generally speaking people in that age bracket are very honourable and honest.  Many of them have said to me that they would feel guilty if they held on to their medical cards.  They are being put into a position of having to choose between returning the medical card voluntarily or to live with the guilt that many of them would feel.  Why is the Minister taking medical cards back from people who already have them?  Is the Minister legally entitled to do so?</p>
          <p eId="para_960">I urge the Minister to reconsider this measure.  It will not save the Government much money.  It probably would have done if the Government had gone ahead with the original proposal to set the income thresholds at a very low level.  On 16 October, I raised the matter on the Adjournment.  The response was given by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, who stated that at that stage the weekly income limit for a medical card would be €240.30 for a single person and €480.60 for a couple.  That was the original intention.  If it had not been for the outcry on the streets showing the tremendous sense of anger and outrage among our senior citizens and the courageous action of at least one Fianna Fáil backbencher who was willing to stand on his principles, that is how it would have remained.  The thresholds only became more realistic in terms of including more people because of the outcry.  It would not take considerably more money to restore the full automatic entitlement of a medical card to all over 70s and therefore to restore the sense of the security of knowing they can afford their medication.  I believe the change will not save that much for the taxpayer, certainly not in the medium term because there will be more people in acute hospitals.</p>

          <from>Deputy Emmet Stagg</from>
          <p eId="para_961">Today we are dealing with an extraordinarily mean-spirited measure that will save the Exchequer little if any money and will put at risk the health of a sizeable number of old age pensioners.  It will take from the over 70s the security and comfort of knowing that if they fell into bad health their savings would not be used up in providing the required care, that their houses would not need to be sold to pay medical bills, that they could go to their doctors or clinic as required and that the cost of medicines would not be a recurring nightmare.  That is what the medical card meant to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">This measure will force all those over 70 to return to the hated means testing, involving prying into their private affairs that they find so repugnant.  I know the HSE and regardless of the provisions of the Bill I know what it will do in this regard.  The measure will remove the right to a medical card from some 25,000 senior citizens.  The medical card for the over 70s was an acknowledgement of the service to society provided by senior citizens.  It was they who struggled through the hard times and paid more than their fair share in high taxes.  I cannot believe the Government is now proposing to withdraw this long-established right.  It is not only the rights to a medical card for the over 70s but also the much longer established right of the over 80s to that entitlement.  Some of these people who have had medical cards for ten years are now in their 90s and will have it withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">The Bill is the legislative measure designed to deprive old age pensioners of their right to a medical card.  The Government, composed of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Independents, is proposing that a majority of the House vote either electronically or by walking through the lobbies to remove the right of those over 70 to a free comprehensive medical service and replace it with a means-tested system for all, which will exclude 25,000 pensioners from health care at a time when they most need it.  The Government has a majority of six in this House of 166.  For this measure to be stopped in its tracks and rejected all that is needed is for four Green, Independent or Fianna Fáil Deputies to vote for the pensioners.  If they were to state their intentions clearly there would be no vote at all.  The Government would be forced to withdraw this mean-spirited measure that targets the old when they are infirm and sick.  The question is whether any of the four Members on the other side of the House have the guts, the bottle, the courage or the gumption to stand up for the old among us.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">Government backbenchers should be aware that old people are not only hurt by their actions but they are also very angry.  They are angry that backbenchers targeted them by supporting this measure which attempted to deprive all old people of medical cards and the accompanying services.  These people are angry that the Government withdrew the original proposal only in part in the face of their huge demonstration.  Many of the old age pensioners who are loyal and longstanding supporters of Fianna Fáil are angry and shocked at the party's betrayal of them.  This was best demonstrated when Government Members gave this measure and other cuts a standing ovation in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">I say to the Government backbenchers that if they cannot find it in their hearts to reject this measure and support senior citizens, then perhaps they will do so to save their own skins and their seats.  Let them not forget that many of the people who are affected and angry are lying in the long grass waiting for them.  Deputy Joe Behan, a heart and soul Fianna Fáil man, found the courage to do so because it was the right thing to do.  He now holds what is probably the most secure seat in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_967">The point is taken.  How we treat the old among us is a measure of our civilisation.  This measure, if passed, will be a major step backwards in that regard.  I have no doubt that the significant majority of decent Members of this House, including many on the Government benches, do not support this Bill.  It is being forced through by the right-wing ideology of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  She could not bear or countenance any universal application of service and insisted that a means test be introduced, even if little or no money were to be saved.  Let it be the last sting of a dying wasp.  The poor, the elderly and the sick have suffered the misery of her stings for the past four years.  Let us give her a going away present by rejecting this mean ideologically driven measure that has terrified and angered old age pensioners and almost fatally damaged the Fianna Fáil dominated Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_971">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I do so on behalf of very many of my constituents who have been in touch with me and continue to be on what is almost a daily basis.  Their immediate concerns are about this measure but they are bothered also by the extraordinary level of confusion that seems to dominate their waking hours because they do not know exactly what the situation will be once this Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">I found breathtaking the arrogance of the Government on budget day in removing the medical card entitlement from those aged over 70.  It was a gross approach to penny pinching.  On budget day that was the single item that jumped out at me from all the other cuts declared.  I found it incredible that the entitlement and small benefit that had been given to our senior citizens was to be removed from them in one fell swoop.  It was extraordinarily disconcerting and lacked any consideration for their wellbeing because of the impact it would have on their financial status and on their psychological wellbeing.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">Although it was breathtaking to hear what was said on budget day, it was equally breathtaking to see what happened in Molesworth Street and at the other meeting in the church in Westland Row where so many senior citizens turned out in force.  They were more vocal than any of us would have expected them to be on that day.  Despite what might have been taken for granted about them their spirit is alive and well.  It was because of the events on those two occasions that the first of the partial U-turns was taken with regard to the budget.  It is true that the decision caused panic and terror up and down the country, not only to those aged over 70, but also to their family members.  They, too, have been in touch, sons and daughters of people affected who are concerned for their elderly parents.  I still get such telephone calls on a regular basis.  That is the reason I oppose this Bill, with the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">The dilemma about automatic entitlement to the medical card for those aged over 70 started out as a political stroke designed to win an election in 2002.  The measure was not agreed with doctors prior to the political announcement being made.  As we now know, the consequence was that the doctors had the Government over the proverbial barrel with regard to payment and to striking a deal.  In typical Fianna Fáil style, the Government once again proved profligate with taxpayers' money and ended up giving general practitioners a significantly greater payment for treating over 70s than they received for other medical card holders.  There was no logic to this agreement except that the Government had played the vote catching game and subsequently had to play catch up with the general practitioners and pay them.  I do not object that the over 70s were given the medical card at the time.  I supported the measure then as I support it now.  I make the political point that at the time its introduction was a political stroke and nothing more.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">That did not seem to matter to the Government as long as the construction sector kept on building.  From June 2007, the Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats promised to index link the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage.  Now that the building has stopped and the economy is in a tail spin, the Government, in a panic, seized upon the entitlements of the weakest in society, the elderly, and young people in education.  It thought it would be able to pull another stroke while protecting the fat cats in the banks and the property moguls.  How wrong it was.  The sight of over 15,000 pensioners and their supporters lining the streets was a fantastic testament to democracy and to the determination of the elderly not to be sidelined or to have their rights removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">On the other hand, I must emphasise the sense of fear, misunderstanding and genuine anger that is abundantly clear when one talks to those people.  This happens every week at my advice clinics and through an unprecedented number of contacts, by e-mail, telephone and every other way that one can imagine.  Everybody one meets on the street is still talking about it and still showing concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">Although the Government harped on about a call to patriotism, this seemed to be a short-sighted money collecting exercise.  What the Minister failed to realise was that automatic entitlement to the medical card makes a lot of sense from a treatment perspective.  I am one of those who believes very strongly in preventive medicine and my view is that this is an area that could, and should, have been retained.  In this country we are very limited in our approach to preventive medicine and we are constantly playing catch up.  When something happens we try to remedy it.  Why do we not try to put down blocks in the first place to prevent it happening?  It should be done and it would have worked very well with the medical card for people aged over 70.  The long view should have been taken here.  Apart from saving money we could have looked at ways of preventing stress and ensuring a better quality of life for those people.  People who can afford to go to the doctor at the first sign of illness remain healthier.  That is well established and other speakers have mentioned it today.  This afternoon I received a publication from UCD where some research has been done on this factor.  This very point was made in that publication with regard to the health and quality of life for older people.  It is also the case that people who can access their general practitioner do not spend as much time in accident and emergency departments and in acute hospitals.  Space is thereby freed up in our desperately overcrowded hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">In its panic and desperation at the sheer wave of hostility to the cuts, the Government flipflopped on the issue several times before finally agreeing to increase substantially the thresholds for eligibility.  I already mentioned confusion.  There truly was confusion and consternation among older people and I am afraid that it has not gone away, unfortunately.  We have all spoken of and heard about those people who are just outside the income limits, the retired civil servant, garda, teacher and others.  These people will be caught and will no longer have an entitlement.  My concern is that there is nothing to stop the Minister or her successors lowering the income eligibility that has now been defined, or failing to index link it to inflation in the long term.  This is simply not acceptable.  The automatic right to a medical card, whatever their ulterior motives at the time, was one of the few positive steps taken by the Government to help the most marginalised in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">There is another issue that has been brought to my attention, and I understand the Minister addressed this within the Bill.  It relates to people who have medical cards that do not expire, for example, until 2013.  Are they supposed to return their cards if they are over the income limits?  I appreciate that this issue is dealt with in the Bill.  When I spoke to a number of these people last Saturday they assured me that whatever the content of the Bill, they would be taking whatever legal advice is available to them and they will be making every effort to ensure that entitlement is retained.  The way they see it is that they have a contract with the Minister and feel they are entitled to the value of that contract.  They have assured me they will be taking whatever action they can.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">For a number of people over 70, their chances of substantially maintaining their quality of life have been seriously damaged by the removal of the medical card.  Our elderly deserve better, and I hope the Minister will review the situation and restore the medical card to those people.</p>

          <p eId="para_988">I know that people were upset, angry and confused.  In fairness to the previous speaker, she was absolutely right — that is a fact.  I was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as making such a statement, so I must have said it, because <i>The Irish Times</i> would not report anything that was not true.  I went about my business, and instead of taking a stand similar to that of my colleague, which has now been highlighted — I have no problem with that colleague — I and others stayed on the battlefield and worked away within the system.  We got a message across to Government and to the Minister that this decision had caused many problems.  I am on record as acknowledging it caused anger, confusion and upset.  I am glad that changes were made following various meetings of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party and other interventions by colleagues.  That is as it should be.  It is important that we continue to understand that this is our role and we should not be afraid to carry it out.  There is a myth, which I must disprove once again, that if one is on the Government benches one does not have a role to play.  I do not want to rile my colleagues, but as I have said before, I would be just as happy, the odd time — not too often, but the odd time — to be on the Opposition benches so I could say anything I wanted.</p>

          <p eId="para_999">In my case, I go about my constituency.  I go to every street in Dublin South West and listen to what people are saying, and then I come in here and convey that to the best of my ability and try to effect change.  I hope that I and others will be credited with doing this because that is exactly what we did.  We were not afraid to do it.  That is what we will continue to do.  In fairness to my party, over the years we have demonstrated support for the rights of senior citizens, as we should.  We are all aging — aging quickly, in some cases.  I understand that and it is very important.  I live in a community with a very young population, although we have an aging population too.  I spend as much time as any of my colleagues with senior citizens' groups.  I am on the board of the Tallaght Welfare Society and I go regularly to the senior citizens' group in Glenview and the south Dublin senior citizens' group at Tymon Bawn Community Centre on Firhouse Road — a place Deputy Shatter will know, as he almost represented it in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">It is important that we continue to listen to people and to knock on the Minister's door and tell her what they are saying.  I hope Deputy Harney — who does, despite what some Deputies think, have a reputation for listening to people — will understand there is still a need to examine all these issues.  She has a difficult job and she knows well that I would be just as happy standing here and talking for the next two hours about Tallaght hospital, about cancer services and about all the things I need in my constituency, but she also knows that as far as this issue is concerned there is a point of view to express.  The Minister will always have to balance her budget and will always have to listen to the various lobbying and interest groups who have all sorts of issues to raise with her.  She has made changes to the medical card proposal, and I hope she will continue to look in a favourable way on the reasonable points that are made to her.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">I note that approximately 370,000 persons aged 70 and over have a medical card.  I am told that 214,000 have a means-tested medical card at the standard GP capitation rate, while approximately 140,000 have a medical card that attracts the higher GP capitation rate.  I also understand it is expected that nearly 95% of those aged 70 or over will continue to have a medical card under the new arrangements announced by the Government.  I am sure the Minister will take the opportunity during the course of this debate to confirm those facts.  As I said earlier, the automatic entitlement to a medical card for people aged 70 or over was introduced in 2001, and at the time of introduction approximately 260,000 people aged 70 and over had a means-tested medical card at the standard GP capitation rate.  At the end of 2001 a further 64,317 people had been granted a medical card at the higher annual GP capitation rate without means assessment.  This number has risen significantly over the years, and at the end of September 2008, 180,000 people had been granted a medical card without means assessment at the higher GP rate, while a further 216,000 held the standard-rate medical card.  In a perfect society everybody would be facilitated and everybody would get benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">The presence of Deputy Enright reminds me that we were at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs this morning at which serious issues of poverty, deprivation and social inclusion were raised.  I did not hear all the heckling that came across because I was trying to concentrate on using my few minutes constructively.  We all have to participate in political debate, but where points of view are expressed I certainly listen to what colleagues are saying, and I understand that they have to articulate their concerns.  I hope they respect the fact that I have to do the same and will continue to do so.  When people contact me about difficulties they have with medical cards — I am not speaking only of the over 70s, as colleagues know, but all categories — I sometimes have a problem trying to figure out why, if the HSE is working according to guidelines, some people lose their medical card or do not receive one because of a small difference in money, bearing in mind that they have particular medical challenges.  I will always regard this as problematic.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">A long time ago I was thanked for getting a person a medical card.  I told that person very quickly that I did not get the medical card nor could I.  As the local public representative I had persuaded the system that this person was entitled to something to which the system had decided he or she was not entitled.  This is the role of the public representative.  I will listen to all the contributions to this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1004">The intensity of the public debate over the automatic entitlement to a medical card for the over 70s age group has been ferocious and the public response has been extremely hostile.  I believe much of this commotion was founded on misinformation and deliberate distortion of the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">It is very important that the central thrust of this Government's intention should not be lost in all the emotion, all the political drama, and all the arguments which have been played out everywhere since the budget.  We must all understand that we are now living in severely altered circumstances compared to those which prevailed up to very recently.  The harsh reality is that our revenues are vastly depleted compared to those formerly at our disposal.  We have a lot less money to share out and there are ever-increasing demands on the public purse.  We have no choice but to make judicious decisions about where and how that money is spent.  We have so many competing and deserving interests but the onus is on the Government to ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent carefully and invested prudently.  The Government is compelled to make these strategic decisions based on the long-term view and the bigger national picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">We have to bear in mind that this Government is motivated purely and simply by financial practicalities and financial constraints.  The Government has at all times acted in the utmost good faith.  Its clear intention is to economise and to allocate the available resources evenly and fairly while at the same time identifying areas of spending which can be reduced.  This Government is driven by the clear need to cut its cloth to suit its measure and every decision is predicated on this.  The budget was formulated in the context of a lot less money to go around and on the overriding imperative to direct those scarce resources towards those who need them most.  There is absolutely nothing inherently wrong with that principle as it is basic common sense.  It is not the intention of the Government to victimise any section of our society.  It is not its intention to cause hardship or anxiety, rather this is a genuine attempt to tackle some of the more expensive aspects of the services which this State provides to its citizens on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">The automatic entitlement to a medical card, irrespective of one's means, has long been considered to be an unduly costly facility.  In my view, the original decision was not correct.  It was particularly costly in terms of the capitation fee which was paid to administer the scheme.  As of 1 October 2008, there were just over 139,000 medical card holders who did not have to satisfy a means test.  Of the medical card holders aged 70 and over, the total number was increasing by between 2.5% and 3% per annum.  However, medical cards issued on an automatic entitlement basis were increasing at over 7% per annum.  The Minister has said repeatedly that it was not possible to sustain this scheme in the medium term because of the escalating costs and the fact that we will have diminishing revenues for the next couple of years.  The truth is this scheme cost the Exchequer €245 million last year alone which was much more costly than originally anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">The Government's purpose was to dismantle elements of the existing scheme in its current guise because it is difficult to justify its overall costs.  The intention is to obtain real savings in the region of €100 million in the overall scheme and to bring it more into line with the costs attaching to the other medical card schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">The capitation fee associated with the over 70s medical card was astronomical relative to the cost of the regular medical card arrangement with the GPs and it simply did not stand to financial reason that it should be so expensive.  The IMO played hardball with the Government in 2001 and extracted a high price from the State for its participation in the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_1011">However, I am delighted that the IMO has now acted very reasonably having regard to the financial limitations being imposed on us and the absolute need to achieve savings everywhere.  The new capitation rate is €290 and it is envisaged that this will secure savings in the region of €16 million next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">In my view, excess hysteria and deliberate confusion were whipped up about this controversial budgetary measure.  Such was the intensity of the debate and the blurring of the facts that people over 70 were needlessly terrorised into thinking that the Government was hell-bent on removing the medical card from everyone over 70.  The Government was deliberately demonised by those who were determined to embarrass it and they shamelessly played on the fears of every medical card holder in this country.  This is despicable and inexcusable.  Political opportunism was dressed up as feigned concern for the elderly and their fears and insecurities were brazenly exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">There is no doubt that the medical card issue was traumatic.  People were outraged by the prospect of the removal of the medical card.  They were worried, angry and frightened and their reaction provoked huge passion and public sympathy.  I reiterate that I believe the Government was acting with honourable intent and that the bona fides of its proposal were completely genuine.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">The Government is forced to operate within the current parameters for public spending and to do otherwise would be reckless and do untold damage to the country's long-term monetary strategy.  As a public representative, I have spoken to several people who have serious concerns about their predicament.  They were concerned about the hardship which this measure might inflict.  Many of those who approached me were very anxious but when I asked what was their understanding of the measure they had assumed that the medical card would be discontinued for everybody, irrespective of their means or their ability to pay.  They understood that the proposal would impose a blanket removal of the medical cards for everyone over 70 years of age.  This was a myth which the Opposition chose not to dispel.  On the contrary, the Opposition reinforced the myth because it wanted to cause needless confusion and despair among so many people.  It is always difficult to revoke an entitlement which has been granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">People become used to having that valuable facility and organise their spending accordingly.  There is no doubt that many people would have been excluded from the medical card entitlement in its original form and this would have caused considerable distress and anguish to the over 70s and to their families who were to lose the entitlement by virtue of their means.  This age group is vulnerable when it comes to their health and well-being.  They are understandably concerned to ensure their future security and quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">It is for that reason I am very happy that this Government behaved wisely and reacted swiftly and with sensitivity.</p>

          <p eId="para_1018">It has acknowledged its commitment to afford special care to the elderly.  It has recognised, without any ambiguity, the singular contribution made by this age group to the national economy and to society.  I am delighted that the Government decided to revise the income threshold up to €700 gross weekly or €36,500 annually for a single person and €1,400 gross per week or €73,000 annually for a couple.  Now 95% of people who are over 70 will retain the medical card.  This amounts to approximately 20,000 people and some of these people may be entitled to apply for a discretionary medical card if they are experiencing particular hardships, health problems or high medical expenses.  Some of these may also be covered by the drugs repayment scheme, which also provides a good cushion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">There is another element to this debate which is relevant and worth noting so that everyone is clear about their entitlements.  I am glad to see that the element of means testing has been retained for this medical card, as is the case with all other medical cards.  It is generally accepted that people who can afford to pay should pay for the services they receive.  Virtually no one disagrees with that principle.  No one expects the taxpayer and the State to carry the entire cost for those who have sufficient means to pay their own way.  In an ideal world with infinite resources, it would be desirable to retain the concept of universal or automatic entitlement but the pressing reality now is that we just cannot afford to extend that luxury to everyone.  While there may be some resistance to the introduction of a means test, it is a fair basis on which to disburse limited resources and ensure that available moneys are delivered to those who need the support of the State to meet their daily needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">A total of 5% of the over 70s population can afford to pay for professional medical services, therapies and pharmaceutical drugs.  I do not believe that anyone of that age cohort, who has more than adequate means, would refuse to pay or would realistically expect the taxpayer to bear his or her costs.  It is only fair and equitable that those above the new weekly threshold of €700 gross income per week should in fact defray their own medical expenses.  I know they will regard this as a very reasonable proposition.  Furthermore, virtually all of that 5% of the over 70s population have private health insurance and may also be availing of the State's long-term illness scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">The revision of this medical card income threshold will come as an enormous relief to all those who felt they were being affected.  The increase in the threshold is substantial and it will ensure that the majority of the over 70s population will now be catered for.  The onus now rests on the Government to find the savings of at least €64 million elsewhere in the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">I am pleased that it has signalled its willingness to review the drugs scheme and to investigate the possibility of dispensing generic drugs where this is appropriate.  I have long been an advocate of effecting economies within the dispensing system and I believe that pharmacists generally are supportive of this initiative.  Medications are expensive in this country and it would be infinitely sensible to explore prescribing generic medicines where a suitable alternative to the branded drug exists and provided it is safe and effective for the patient.  There is scope for significant savings in this drug initiative and all the parties concerned can work together to achieve greater cost efficiencies when it comes to prescribing and dispensing medicines.  For these reasons I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1025">I listened with amazement to the offerings of Deputies on the Government backbenches.  Deputy Aylward has just informed us how delighted he is with the provisions before the House.  It brings me back to budget day when this debacle first started.  In the forefront of my mind, I have Fianna Fáil and Green Party Deputies, and the two Deputies of the Progressive Democrats as they then were, standing in a round of hysterical applause to congratulate a Minister for Finance who looked somewhat out of his depth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">Since then there have been five U-turns on the medical card for the over 70s issue.  This afternoon, we have had a sixth.  I have already put on the record of the House my opposition to this change in the law.  I believe it was right to extend the medical card to people over 70 years and that they should continue to retain it.  There are substantial health benefits in not applying a medical card means test to the over 70s and substantial economic savings to the State when people get access to medical care faster than would otherwise be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">I do not accept the capitation payment as being a great victory secured by the Government.  The truth is that it was always illogical that doctors were paid a ridiculously low sum of money for caring for those over 70 who had the medical card on a means-tested basis while then being paid an enormous sum of money for those who did not go through a means test at all.  The Government simply decided to target persons over 70, causing a great deal of stress, fear and confusion throughout the community.  Any Government organising its business in a coherent way would have engaged in discussions with the medical organisations to agree a new capitation payment well in advance of the budget.  This would have ensured a more sane and coherent approach to the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">Based on promises made in 2001, and the subsequent legislation, those over 70 have a legitimate expectation that they will continue to have a right to retain the medical card.  If the Government attempts to deprive people of it, based on the provisions contained in this ill-thought out Bill, particularly those in section 7, it will run into serious legal difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">The Government may be engaged in a nod-and-wink routine anyway.  Anyone over 70 years on 2 March next who considers themselves no longer eligible for the medical card based on the financial thresholds in the legislation is under an obligation to report their lack of eligibility to the HSE.  It is important that those who have legitimate expectations are aware of the likely consequences if they do not report to the HSE.  The Government might inform us if there will be groups of inspectors knocking on the doors of the homes of the over 70s seeking to get back medical cards they have been using for several years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">Failure to report ineligibility also makes one liable to prosecution under section 49 of the Health Act 1970.  If a person knowingly fails to report if his or her means exceed the thresholds set down by this legislation, then he or she is at risk of being fined £50 in old money, which I reckon is €63.  Will those who do not report to the HSE be prosecuted?  Is the Government serious in trying to deprive anyone over 70 of their medical card or is it involved in a nod-and-wink routine?  The Government must come clean about this because there is no serious penalty for someone who does not report their ineligibility.  There is no reason why elderly people should be given unnecessary worry.  The Government should, in fact, change its mind and not deprive anyone over 70 of a medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">I want to highlight one issue which the Government and the Minister for Health and Children obviously came to as an afterthought.  It is referred to in this morning's <i>The Irish Times</i>, no doubt an inspired leak to deflect criticism from this debate.  It is also an addendum to the Minister’s speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">The Bill is ill-thought out even having had a gestation period of three months.  It was published only last week.  It contains no provisions of any description to address the position of widows and widowers.  Within our income tax legislation and our general social welfare code, there are various provisions to specifically ensure that a bereaved spouse on becoming a widow or widower is not penalised financially by the State as a consequence of their bereavement.  In this respect the Bill constitutes a naked political assault on widows and widowers.  Its provisions, if implemented in full, will mean that a person over 70, who through bereavement becomes a widow or widower and as a consequence has €1 in excess of the €700 threshold, must inform the HSE they are no longer eligible for a medical card.  It is an obligation to notify the HSE of this before the deceased spouse is buried.  They may even be prosecuted under section 49 of the Health Act 1970 if they do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">What Government would publish legislation that requires someone over 70 to report that to the HSE before they bury their spouse and, if they fail to do so, be liable to prosecution?  Has any thought been given to the implication of this measure?</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">In an addendum to her speech, the Minister stated, "The Government has been concerned at all times in these new arrangements to ensure that a person aged 70 or over would not lose their medical card as an immediate consequence of the death of their spouse".  That is untrue.  The Government has not been so concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">I raised this issue two months ago on a Fine Gael Private Members' motion opposing the proposed changes to the medical card legislation.  I warned the Government about this problem, yet it has still failed to address it in this Bill.  The Minister earlier said some amendment would be introduced to ensure a person will not lose a medical card immediately upon the death of a spouse. <i>The Irish Times</i> today reports widowers and widows will be allowed their medical cards for three years.  I do not know whether that is accurate.  Is the Minister telling the House that if a 72 year old wife loses her husband, when she reaches 75 her medical card will be taken from her?  What type of social policy is that?  What type of health policy is it?</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">Even more extraordinarily, in the Government's definition of couples it has missed a crucial issue.  I am not suggesting that a couple living together outside marriage, an elderly man and woman, should be discriminated against compared to the husband and wife living together.  This Bill discriminates against widows and widowers in an unconstitutional, unsustainable and indefensible fashion.  Under the Bill, a 74 or 75 year old bereaved widow or widower can be deprived of a medical card in circumstances in which the income is less than the income of a 74 or 75 year old man or woman cohabiting with someone else.  We have a constitutional provision that seeks to protect the family based on marriage and, as a minimum, directs this House not to discriminate against an individual as a consequence of being married.  The manner in which the Government has dealt with widows and widowers in the legislation as published, and the minimal change the Minister is now proposing, which will result in a widow or widower being deprived of the medical card, is unconstitutional because preferential treatment is given to an unmarried individual over 70 cohabiting with someone else.  It is contrary to Article 41 of the Constitution.  If it were challenged it would not constitutionally withstand the challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">If the President was to refer the Bill under Article 26 to ask the Supreme Court to address that issue, the Supreme Court would have no choice but to find this provision unconstitutional.  If the Minister will not allow all persons over 70 to retain the medical card and if she insists on applying a form of means test, at the very least where persons over 70 have already been given a medical card, she should not deprive them of it as a consequence of being widowed or becoming a widower.  She should not deprive them of it as a consequence of a bereavement and she should not introduce a measure that gives them some licence to retain the medical card for a short period and take it from them afterwards.  If she does, that will not withstand constitutional challenge.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_1038">I welcome the opportunity to revisit this issue.  I was interested to hear the comments of speakers opposite, particularly the accusation of political opportunism.  After the budget, I spoke with my father who represented Laois-Offaly for a long number of years.  He referred me to a comment by a colleague from the benches opposite when the vote was originally taken in 2001 about how we were making the biggest mistake of our political lives and that we would pay dearly for it.  We can now throw back that comment at our colleagues.  This has been the least thought out and worst budget decision in recent memory.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">I want to give the lie to the unofficial line peddled by Fianna Fáil Deputies and councillors, that this was a civil servants' budget and that it was not really a budget by politicians.  People have been happy to peddle that line around the country to divert blame from themselves and their parliamentary and democratic responsibility in this House.  I should not say I am glad if a civil servant leaked anything and I do not know who leaked this but I am glad that a statement appeared showing the memorandum that went to the Minister for Finance on this issue.  This made it very clear that it was a decision that would not wash well politically.  It took a civil servant to realise that the decision on the medical cards was not one the public would accept.  It took a civil servant to see the political consequences of the decision.  Two months after the budget, it amazes me that 15 men and women sat around a Cabinet table and not one realised the consequences this decision would have for ordinary people.  Despite the 15,000 people who appeared on our streets, 1,000 for every Cabinet Minister, they still do not realise the pain they have caused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">Deputies opposite referred to the chaos and confusion.  We did not cause that.  Five separate eligibility criteria were published between the Department of Health and Children and the HSE on the medical card limits in the days after the budget.  Every Government politician who spoke gave different figures.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance had different and confused figures in respect of this.  That is where the chaos and confusion arose as a result of this decision.  It was made up as they went along.  That is why we find ourselves dealing with this legislation today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">The Government thought it had chosen the easy option.  If there is one positive element to this, it is that maybe the Government will realise that the elderly people of this country cannot be taken for granted.  I am not convinced yet that the Government realises this.  Nobody bought the platitudes from the Green Party on the day of the protest, that the party would never take old people for granted again.  It was stomach churning to listen to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">I dispute the figures provided today in respect of the figure of 5%.  Deputy O'Connor referred to the meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs this morning, when the word "millionaires" was thrown across the floor.  Members referred to millionaires and High Court judges, who they must think are very unpopular.  This is being repeatedly referred to.  I refer to a memo from a meeting I held with the Offaly branch of the Retired Teachers Association.  These are primary school teachers and each one over 70 who I met will lose the medical card.  I have yet to meet a teacher who is a millionaire.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, was a teacher and is better off now but is not a millionaire.  Her colleagues over 70 will not have a medical card if they had any increment for an extra post of responsibility.  The figures speak for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">Retired teachers employed prior to 1995 are not eligible for dental or aural entitlements to which anyone else in the PRSI system is entitled.  They have already been penalised in that.  Everyone knows of the health deterioration that comes with the aging process.  A real and genuine fear is that the expense will deter people from seeking medical care.  They are caught every way in respect of the changes to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The notion of responsibility on the individual to declare is almost unworkable.  From Deputy Shatter's figures, the idea of anyone reporting themselves rather than risking a €63 or €62 fine is depending on them to very honest.  Aside from honesty, there will be chaos when the letters and forms arrive.  I have yet to see a simple form from any Department.  If they were so simple, Deputies would not spend time in clinics filling them in and helping people to fill them in.  They are not simple.  It will be interesting to see the simple version.  Either the Department needs the information or it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">I refer to those who do not qualify, who will have their cards taken back by the Government and who can get a card with discretion if they are seriously ill.  I do not trust the way the discretion will work.  Sick people who should be trying to get better will spend their time instead contacting politicians and HSE officials in an attempt to retain their medical cards.  The use of gross income for threshold is a mistake and it is extremely unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">I refer to the living alone issue raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.  We had a lengthy discussion on this during the debate on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill last week.  A one-person household incurs 70% of the expenses of a two-person household.  The criteria for the threshold will penalise those who lose a spouse because their medical card will be taken from them, which is wrong.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Máire Hoctor)</from>
          <p eId="para_1047">I am happy to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  The Bill gives effect to recent Government decisions to end the automatic entitlement to a medical card, irrespective of income, for people aged 70 and over, and to introduce new arrangements in order that the vast majority of these people will continue to have medical cards under a new income threshold.  There are good policy reasons for introducing this legislation.  In particular, it enables the ending of the high capitation fee for GPs that has been paid since 2001 only in respect of over 70 year olds who received a medical card by virtue of age rather than means.  The fee was paid for approximately 38% of people aged 70 and over.  People in general are pleased that the perverse incentive this special fee created between different GP practices is being ended.  While some people do not want to admit it, GPs were willing to point out there was a high concentration of GP practices in our larger cities where incomes were higher while the number of practices in disadvantaged areas has reduced.  This legislation will put an end to that and there will be equal spread of GP practices, which will be near people, and services will be provided to those who need them most.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">People aged 70 years and over are more likely to require regular access to health services and it is appropriate that additional support be put in place to enable their access to medical care.  At the same time, it is consistent with the general approach of the GMS for many years and with the need to provide for financially sustainable schemes that the scheme should be limited to all but the top 5% of income earners among over 70s.  There are, and will continue to be, pressing calls on scarce resources to meet the needs of many people across the range of health services.  It is appropriate that we devote taxpayers' funds to meet those needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">The number of people aged 70 and over in our population is 350,000.  It is projected this number will increase to 363,000 by 2011, 433,000 by 2016 and 535,000 by 2021.  We need to plan for, and provide, many health services for the people now aged 55 and over who will form the over 70s group at that time and use public resources in the most effective and fairest way to provide those services.  It is easy for the Opposition to ignore our growing aging population as people, thankfully, live healthier and longer lives but the Government must address the projected figures and look after those who need care most.  We must base the assessment on this and people's ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">As outlined by the Minister earlier, the continuation of the automatic medical card, and the high capitation fee paid for it, does not represent prudent or fair financial planning.  We should concentrate on using resources for those with the greatest medical and financial need.  The Bill provides that those who are aged 70 or over before 1 January 2009 and who had full eligibility on age grounds will continue to have full eligibility as long as their gross income from all sources does not exceed the specified limits.  The medical card is evidence of full eligibility.  These generous limits are €700 per week gross in the case of a single person, excluding any income from savings or similar investments whose principal value is €36,000 or less, and €1,400 per week gross in the case of a couple, excluding any income from savings or similar investments whose principal value is €72,000 or less.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">As the Minister said, a person who had automatic entitlement to a medical card, and, therefore, full eligibility, will continue to have full eligibility until 2 March 2009.  Consequently, all persons can continue to use their medical card as normal until that date even if their gross income exceeds the relevant income limits set out in this legislation.  The Government wants to ensure the process of self-assessment for elderly people will be much simplified compared to that required under the existing "hardship" based scheme.  Consequently, the HSE has been asked to ensure any assistance a person who is currently over 70 may need regarding self-assessment be made available on an administrative basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">A much simplified means test will be arranged for people reaching 70 on or after 1 January to enable them to apply under the new arrangements.  They will receive confirmation from the HSE that they have full eligibility and will continue to have full eligibility as long as their gross income does not exceed the relevant limit.  The Government is also providing in this legislation for the dependants of people over 70.  The Bill also includes a provision to amend the Health Contributions Act 1979 to provide an exemption from the health contribution for any person, who is or reaches the age of 70 on or after 1 January 2009.  The amendment will exempt everybody over 70 from paying the contribution regardless of whether they fall into the categories exempted under section 11 of the 1979 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">The legislation is designed to give effect to the Government's decision to replace the automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over with a new arrangement based on gross income limits.  As the Minister outlined in her contribution, she has examined a range of options to protect persons aged 70 and over who lose their spouse.  I lobbied her to address this because this must be recognised as a difficulty.  The medical card should not be lost on the death of a spouse and I understand, on the basis of work on this issue over the past number of weeks, that she proposes to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">Opposition Members are suffering from amnesia.  Deputy Enright was quick to quote the contributions of Government Members on this issue in 2001 but Deputy Noonan, when serving as Minister for Health and Children, stated on 19 December 1996:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1055">In those circumstances I do not think that it is justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to all citizens aged 80 and over without reference to their means.  I am satisfied the health boards will assess people according to their circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">Thankfully, the HSE continues to do so.  Deputy McManus referred to millionaires with medical cards as an "obscenity" in November 2004.  She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1057">In Ireland millionaires have been created by our economic boom.  In 2001 we know now 11 of these millionaires paid no tax at all.  If any of these millionaires, whether tax paying or not, is over 70 years of age, they automatically qualify for a medical card.  This is an obscenity when compared to the experience of ordinary hard working families.</p>

          <p eId="para_1059">The Government has adopted a practical approach in recent years to improving the lives of older people.  Our growing aging population must be recognised and the figures used in 2001 do not compare to the current projected figures.  Most of us would like to live as long as possible with services available to us.  However, services must be provided for those who need them most and who cannot afford them.  More than 95% of people aged 70 and over will retain the medical card, which is important.  The Government has made a commitment in my appointment as Minister for State with responsibility for older people to look after our elderly and it is a priority for Government.  The establishment of the Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for older people in recent months has led to unprecedented funding increases through the HSE.  For example, the total funding provision this year to allow the HSE directly support a range of services for older people is in the region of €1.8 billion.  More than €800 million of this is ear-marked for residential care services.  Since 2006, in excess of €200 million new funding has been made available to develop or expand community-based services such as home care packages, home-helps, meals on wheels and day and respite care.  Our aim has been to ensure that older people receive as much care as possible in their own homes; that high standards are set and enforced in all residential care settings; and that the cost of residential care is always affordable and not an anxiety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">The western world enjoys, as never before, the opportunity of aging.  Through our social, scientific and economic progress, human life has been strengthened and prolonged.  In ancient Greece, life expectancy at birth was 20 years of age.  By the 1700s, life expectancy had only increased to 30 years of age.  In 2008, just 300 years on, half of all baby girls being born in Ireland are expected to live to 100 years of age and beyond.  Our longevity is something to be celebrated.  The Government recognises this and is committed to supporting older people.  This is reflected in the current social partnership agreement, Towards 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">In the agreement the Government and the social partners have adopted a life cycle perspective, placing the person as the centrepiece of social policy development.  The vision for older people, as reinforced in Towards 2016, is to provide the support, where necessary, to enable older people to maintain their health and wellbeing, as well as to live active and full lives, in an independent way in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">There are specific initiatives for older people in the partnership agreement, such as pensions and income supports; housing and accommodation; community and residential health care; mobility; and promoting education and employment opportunities.  The high-level objectives of these initiatives, individually and in combination, are intended to make a real and significant improvement in the quality of life of older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">A new nursing homes support scheme, in the fair deal legislation, is going through the Houses at present and was approved by Government and originally announced in December 2006.  The Bill providing for the scheme was published on 9 October 2008 and is on Second Stage in the Dáil.  The Minister intends to introduce the new scheme in 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The fair deal legislation is designed to remove real financial hardship from many individuals and their families who, under the current system of nursing home subvention, have to sell or re-mortgage homes to pay for the cost of nursing home care.  There will be one transparent system of support towards the cost of care that will be fair to all, irrespective of whether they are in public, private or voluntary nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">The scheme will equalise State support for public and private long-term care recipients.  This will meet one of the objectives of Towards 2016, namely, that State support should be indifferent as to whether a person is in public or private care.  At present, the State pays an average of 90% of the cost for people in public nursing homes.  In contrast, the State only meets approximately 40% of the estimated average cost of care in a private nursing home and some people have to sell or mortgage their homes to meet their care costs.  In some cases people receive no State support whatsoever.  The scheme aims to render private long-term care affordable and anxiety-free, and ensure that no one has to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for their care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The current standards for nursing homes are set out in the Nursing Home (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993.  The HSE inspects private nursing homes on the basis of these standards, but public homes are not inspected.  The Health Act 2007 provides for the registration and inspection of all nursing homes, public, private and voluntary.  It provides for future inspections to be carried out by the chief inspector of social services, part of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  The existing inspection and registration systems for residential services will be replaced by a strengthened and expanded system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">In 2007, the Minister for Health and Children published a new set of draft national quality standards for residential care settings for older people.  The standards, when approved and underpinned by regulations, will replace those set out in the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993.  Importantly, the new standards will apply to all residential settings, public, private and voluntary, where older people are cared for and for which registration is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">The draft standards are designed to ensure the protection of residents, to safeguard and promote their health, welfare and quality of life and to ensure that there is a focus on the well-being, dignity and autonomy of older people.  As the Health Act 2007 provides that the enhanced inspection function will be taken over by HIQA, the draft standards were formally referred to the authority for consultation and finalisation.  HIQA established a working group to finalise the draft standards which included public consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">Earlier this year, the HIQA board submitted its final draft national quality standards for residential care settings for older people to the Minister for Health and Children for her approval, as required under the Health Act 2007.  Regulations will be introduced to underpin the standards and at the moment the Department is in the process of carrying out a regulatory impact analysis, RIA, on them.  As part of this process, we commissioned an independent consultancy to carry out a cost-benefit analysis on the financial impact the standards will have in long-term residential settings.  Consultation with stakeholders is also a part of this process and on Thursday, 23 October 2008, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and I hosted a consultation session on the draft standards.  Many of the key stakeholders were present and it offered them an opportunity to feed into and inform the RIA before finalisation and to discuss the standards, their criteria and proposed regulations in advance of their introduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">A comprehensive policy vision requires a comprehensive, cross-departmental approach to policy development and delivery.  The establishment of the Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for Older People in January of this year will bring coherence to Government planning, policy and service delivery for older people.  This office encompasses three Departments.  As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I also have responsibilities in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I am also a member of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion which ensures that there is an integrated coherent approach to issues relating to older people across Government level.  This approach is crucial to delivering the Government's vision of improved integration of services, and thereby further supporting older people in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">My office will also continue to develop health policy and will oversee and monitor the delivery of health and personal social services for older people, and the running of the long-stay charges scheme.  It will, in short, be the focal point for the development of a more comprehensive policy on older people.  The resources of my office, which is currently staffed by officials from the Department of Health and Children, will be strengthened shortly by the addition of the staff of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  These new staff will significantly add to the research and overall capacity of my office.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">The voluntary sector in general will also make a positive and essential contribution to the development of policy on older people.  This will be primarily through the establishment of a new national advisory council on older people.  One of the main functions of this new advisory council will be to advise me, as Minister of State, on all aspects of the lives of older people.  The council will also suggest ways of better co-ordination and delivery of services for this sector of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">The establishment of the office, the inter-departmental network and the advisory council will bring a greater coherence to policy-making for older people.  These significant new measures will allow for a much greater degree of cross-cutting and will further develop the partnership approach that has featured so strongly in the planning and development of services for older people in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">Co-operation between Departments and agencies and relevant stakeholders is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  The area of carers is of particular interest to me as Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  As Members are aware, we are developing a national carers strategy.  An inter-departmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, was set up to progress the issue.  The Departments of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Health and Children, the Health Service Executive and FÁS are also represented in the group.  The development of the strategy also involved a wide-ranging consultation process, including meetings with the social partners, the carer representative groups and a written public consultation process earlier this year.  The strategy will focus on all informal and family carers in the community and not only those in receipt of a social welfare payment.  It is hoped that the strategy will be finalised shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">Within the EU member states, Ireland stands out as having a relatively youthful population.  While we are undoubtedly on the same demographic path as our EU counterparts, we are still some way behind.  The latest statistics tell us that 11% of people living in Ireland are aged 65 years or over.  It has been estimated that this figure will rise to 20% by 2036, and to 29% by 2056.  Thus, an opportunity exists at present, while our nation is still young, for us to carefully plan ahead.  This opportunity has been recognised by Government and manifests itself, in particular, in two key commitments, namely, the development of a strategy for positive aging and a future funding model for long-term care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">I am pleased that one of the key functions of my office is to develop a strategy for positive ageing.  The new strategy will be developed on a cross-departmental basis.  My goal is to ensure that this strategy is meaningful and innovative and that it will result in real improvements in the lives of older people.  The strategy will involve, for example, the development of operational plans by Departments, clearly setting out objectives relating to older people, and joined up thinking on initiatives serving this community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">Other areas for consideration include ongoing mechanisms to monitor progress and to identify challenges.  As I said, the policy vision outlined in Towards 2016 requires a comprehensive cross-departmental approach.  It also requires sustained and sustainable levels of funding.  The substantial funds allocated by the Government to services for older people in the last three years is a testament to its commitment to the principles outlined in Towards 2016.  In 2006 and 2007 alone, more than €400 million was provided to enhance service developments throughout the sector, of which more than €165 million was for community based services.  A further €25 million was provided in 2008 and funding levels for community services were maintained in the recent budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">To underpin the objectives in Towards 2016, the needs of older people were specifically highlighted in the social inclusion element of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  Some €9.7 billion will be invested under the older people's programme, with €4.7 billion allocated to the living at home sub-programme and €5 billion to the residential care sub-programme.  The Government is firmly committed to using the national development plan as a vehicle to translate policy into practice over the period of the plan.</p>

          <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_1081">As a Member of this House for more than 11 years, I can honestly say this is the most reprehensible and repulsive legislation that has come before us in that time.  We are accustomed to spin from the Government but to find that the parliamentary draftsmen have been brought into the dishonest portrayal of these proposals is disappointing.  The explanatory memorandum refers to the Bill as providing a new "scheme for entitlement to medical cards".  The reality, however, is that it introduces a scheme for the removal of that entitlement.  It is dishonest to pretend otherwise.  I cannot recall any measure that has caused so much distress and upset.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">Apart from the distress it has caused, it has also come as a shock to older people who, in planning their retirement, factored into their budgets the expectation of a medical card.  These are people who were careful and who planned for the future.  Now they find those plans, perhaps built over many years, are in tatters.  Within the space of a few months, they have endured several attacks.  Not only are their medical cards withdrawn, thus leaving them to find money for health bills they never expected to face, but they are also discovering that their pensions are not worth a fraction of what they expected and of what they contributed.  Moreover, any savings will be affected by the fall in interest rates to almost nothing.  Dividends on investments they may have made are reduced if not cancelled for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">Whatever about frustrating the expectations of those who assumed they would receive a medical card next year and in the following years, nobody, on either side of the House or outside it, imagined the Government would take medical cards from those already in possession of them.  This is being done not to millionaires but to 80 year olds, 90 year olds and 100 year olds.  We heard all the claptrap about how millionaires do not deserve medical cards.  There is no denying that and I fully agree that such persons should not be eligible for them.  However, it is not they who are losing medical cards.  For the most part, millionaires who were eligible never bothered to claim them.  It is middle Ireland — compliant, tax-paying, hard-working former employees — who will lose out.  Now, in old age, they are left to worry about how they will pay their medical bills.  Teachers, nurses, gardaí, civil servants and their middle-income counterparts from the private sector will struggle without the medical cards they were promised by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">We can be certain that from 1 January 2009, as has happened in the past, elderly people will avoid visiting their GPs and renewing prescriptions because they simply cannot afford to do so.  Even if they can afford it, it may be their perception that they cannot.  Older people are fearful of the future and careful with their money.  If they believe they cannot afford to pay for medicines, they will stop taking them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">I spoke today to a former assistant principal who went on to work in the Dáil until recently.  This person will lose her medical card next year.  Single people are particularly penalised by the new system.  It has always been the case that two people can live more cheaply than one.  To set the single income threshold at half that for couples is particularly punitive for single individuals.  In the case of two neighbouring households, for example, one occupied by a single person and the other by a couple, the overheads will be exactly the same.  If nothing else is done, this at least should be reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">The Minister seemed to assure us when this proposal was announced that the eligibility limits would be index linked.  We now discover this is not the case.  This is another example of the dishonesty shown to the public.  Everybody understands that the money is gone, that the cushion we should have had against a global recession was spent foolishly and in a flathúlach fashion.  However, there must surely be something left for our elderly.  Surely at least those already granted a medical card should be allowed to retain it for the remaining years of their lives.  Surely those who expected to receive a medical card this year or next could be granted at least two free GP visits per year or free medicines.  Even a small flat charge for GP services would be better than nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">However, no effort has been made to provide any such concessions.  Instead, the individuals concerned will have to pay the full cost of their primary medical care.  Moreover, there is a double whammy in that tax relief on medical expenses will only be available at the standard rate.  The elderly have been given one slap in the face after another, with no attempt made to negotiate with GPs.  We were told the existing scheme was too expensive and that GPs were making considerable sums out of their participation in it.  However, no attempt was made to renegotiate existing arrangements with GPs or to move to the provision of generic medicines.  Instead, it was easy to use elderly people as leverage in seeking a new deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">Eligibility is calculated with reference to gross income, including income from savings, dividends and so on.  Never has such income been more volatile.  A situation will arise where individuals will be eligible for a medical card one year but not the next and so on.  Nobody, particularly elderly people, can plan their budgets on the basis of such uncertainty as to entitlements.  They will live the remainder of their lives in fear and uncertainty, not knowing whether they need to pay health insurance in any given year and whether they can afford to put heating oil in the tank.  This is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">The entire thrust of the philosophy of the Minister and the Health Service Executive, as referred to again today by the Minister, is to move away from hospital care and towards care in the community.  The aim is to keep people healthy and out of hospital by ensuring they have access to GP services so that illnesses are detected early and there is early intervention and treatment before the need for hospitalisation arises.  That was the thinking behind the universal provision of medical cards for over 70s.  In addition to early intervention, follow-up physiotherapy, dressings and so on were to be available to them free of charge.  It is proven that this provision improved the quality of life of people over 70 years of age.  In addition, there was a substantial saving for the State arising from the reduction in hospitalisation charges, which cost a minimum of €1,000 per day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">Older people are more frequently ill and need to consult their GP more regularly than younger people.  The loss of a medical card to an elderly person is twice the burden it is for a younger individual.  This greater financial burden on older people must be recognised.  We must acknowledge that older people fear the future in a way that younger people do not.  They will husband their resources and may decide, if they feel unwell, to wait one more day before seeking medical attention, then another day and so on until it may be too late.  The promise of primary care investment is just that, another false promise.  Nobody can have faith in a system or a Government that is built on ever shifting foundations, where principles expounded one day are cast out the next, a system where there is no consistency, logic or humanity.  If somebody who loses their medical card faces huge medical bills, what are they expected to do?  We are told by the Minister that the HSE will have discretion and will use it.  Everybody knows what discretion for the HSE actually means.  It is resource and time related.  If somebody contracts cancer in January, they might receive a medical card, but if they contract cancer in July, it will be tough luck.  That is the reality of the HSE's discretion.  That was the case this year; God knows if it will even have that much discretion next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The killer blow to the elderly which will ensure they will have even less disposable income after they pay their medical bills is that they will also have to pay the Lenihan levy.  A person whose income is at the threshold where they do not meet the eligibility criteria for the medical card will pay a minimum levy of €3,650 from that disposable income.  If the person has been prudent and saved their money to provide for their future, they will pay even more because they will have to pay the levy on savings and investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">As a final straw, it was reported in today's newspapers that there would be a concession by the Minister.  In the legislation, as published, if widows and widowers had an income of slightly over €700 following the death of their spouse, the single person's eligibility level, they would lose their medical card.  The big concession is that the Minister will wait until they are three years older before taking their medical card.  It is breathtaking in its pettiness, total lack of compassion and meanness of spirit.  It is unbelievable a Minister would suggest this.  If I were the Minister of State, I would claim I had nothing to do with it.  It is an absolute disgrace to even think of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093">I wish to deal with two further issues.  The elderly must now attempt to take out private medical insurance again, that is, if they can get it and all their existing conditions will still be covered.  They will also have to pay more because there is a levy.  The Minister presides over the sale of this product.  I have never previously seen a case where the introduction of competition in the sale of a product or service meant the price increased for everybody.  That defies all understanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094">Where older people have lost their medical card, are unable to be kept in their homes and discover they must go into a nursing home, they will have to pay the full cost of that nursing home care under the new regime.  The fair deal is fair to some, but those with savings and who are losing their medical card will not benefit from it.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_1099">I thank Deputy Mitchell for sharing time.  When contributing to the Second Stage debate on new legislation, it is the normal expectation Deputies would speak to the detail of the Bill.  However, in the case of this legislation from the Minister, Deputy Harney, I call on the Government to withdraw the Bill and start again.  To paraphrase the old adage, given where the Government wants to get to, this is the wrong place to start.  Even at this late stage it is not too late to correct this mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">The introduction of a universal automatic entitlement to a medical card for the over 70s was announced with great fanfare by the previous Fianna Fáil Taoiseach.  Perhaps he wanted to cement one good deed into history with a grand gesture to rival the introduction of free travel for pensioners by a previous Fianna Fáil leader, the late Mr. Charles Haughey.  In the Bill before the House the principle of a universal automatic entitlement to a medical card for the over 70s is being deconstructed by the Taoiseach and the Minister.  Even worse, it is being deconstructed in a way that is vague and sees the reintroduction of means testing.  Worst of all, the number of pensioners to lose their medical card will be relatively small.  With all the resources at the Minister's disposal, is this Bill the best option she can choose to achieve some minimal short-term cash savings which are decreasing by the week?  Did she not consider any other options?</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">When the Minister started this review, she could have examined the demographics and other statistics to find an age somewhere between 70 and 105 years, for example, whereby she could still preserve the principle of a universal automatic entitlement to a medical card.  The Fianna Fáil Government should have been able to find an age bracket that would ensure the entitlement was preserved for some age band of pensioners.  The fact that the Minister did not do this suggests the Bill is the precedent that removes the automatic entitlement for a starter group of pensioners and that the age selected and the flexibility in the means test protocol will be used to gradually expand the band of pensioners to be excluded from entitlement in future years.  Cutting off entitlement to the medical card for a small number of older people now, approximately 20,000 according to the Minister's estimate, does not make any sense, unless the real agenda is to gradually exclude more in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">Having abolished the universal automatic entitlement to a medical card for the over 70s, the Minister seems to have had second thoughts and has now introduced a new three tier system of entitlement for the over 70s.  One category is those who can receive a medical card based on an assessment of their financial circumstances.  A second category is those people over 70 years whose income is above the specified income limits but who can apply to the HSE for a discretionary medical card on the basis that their health circumstances cause undue financial hardship.  The third category of people over 70 years will be denied a medical card under the terms of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">Current medical card holders over the age of 70 years will have to make a voluntary declaration to the HSE by 2 March next year if their income is above the thresholds.  People who turn 70 years after next January and who do not have a medical card will have to undergo what the Department of Health and Children describes as a simplified means test to establish that their income does not exceed the threshold.  Perhaps the Minister would explain what is meant by "simplified", because it is far from simple when the application is being processed.  The Bill provides for a complex bureaucratic calculation protocol covering gross income, including income received through pensions, interest on investments or savings, rents from property and income from part-time employment.  All of this is to be done on the basis of a voluntary declaration by the pensioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">The signals from the Bill are that people who worked hard all their lives, made a success of their career, achieved a good standard of income and managed to save a good lump sum for use in their declining years are now to be penalised by the State.  In their years as pensioners they are to lose out in comparison with others.  This is not fair.  Effectively, the Bill provides for an honour system of voluntary declaration on the means test protocol.  I will agree with the Minister on one point, that, by and large, those who are likely to lose their entitlement to a medical card are people of personal honour.  All their lives they were model citizens, independent and responsible, earning their living, paying their taxes and saving for the future.  Furthermore, we must not forget that even as pensioners they are still paying taxes.  These people are more deserving of a universal automatic entitlement to a medical card than many others.  If the country cannot afford the automatic entitlement in these more difficult economic times, I propose that the Minister consider the concept of retaining the universal automatic entitlement to a medical card and asking these citizens to make a moderate annual co-payment as an alternative way to cover the budgetary gap.</p>
          <p eId="para_1105">I believe in the principle of universal entitlement to a medical card.  I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts when this proposal was introduced in 2002.  The advice was given to the Minister at the time but the calculations by the Department were totally inaccurate.  The universal entitlement to a medical card was introduced in an attempt to win the 2002 general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_1106">People are taxed throughout their working lives and through the probate system.  Many have made a considerable contribution, have half pensions and are still paying income tax.  In many cases, the only benefit they receive is the reassurance provided by a medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">Many people have lost substantial savings.  In recent weeks, I heard of a case of a senior citizen with a large shareholding in the Bank of Ireland whose savings declined in value from hundreds of thousands of euro to less than €100,000.  This person is so concerned and experiencing such stress that their life expectancy is likely to have been shortened considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">A large number of independent elderly people who are not supported by sons or daughters live in private nursing homes at their own expense.  The value of shareholdings and investments has declined as a result of the current financial debacle, while State investment in pensions is declining daily.  Many people invested privately in blue chip companies having been given the impression by the Government that these companies and the banks were the best places to invest.  Their investments are now worth very little.  In the past year, for example, the value of Bank of Ireland shares has declined from €18 euro per share to slightly more than €1.  I appeal to the Minister to reintroduce an automatic entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 years and over.  This is the least those in their senior years should expect.</p>

          <p eId="para_1109">I will share time with Deputy Beverley Flynn.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me an opportunity to contribute on Second Stage of the Health Bill 2008.  The issue of medical cards for elderly people has been most emotive, with many people fearing that all medical cards would be taken from those aged over 70 years.  Such a step was never intended.  Hearing people from my parents' generation cry, worried and fearful, on radio shows made for tough listening.  The real fear of many people was on display at the protest on Kildare Street following the budget.  However, I am reminded of how quickly times change given that in 2001 Opposition Deputies had no appetite for the introduction of medical cards for those aged 70 years and over.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">Under the new system, the Health Service Executive will write to all medical card holders aged 70 years and over informing them about the new arrangements.  People whose income is below the new threshold will keep their cards and continue to use them as normal.  Only those whose incomes are above the threshold will be required to notify the HSE.  If a person's income is below the limits, he or she will not have to wait on a letter to arrive and should not be worried or fearful.  Such persons can rest assured they will keep the medical card.  This vital information, which was lost in the debate, needs to be reiterated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">The new income thresholds are designed to ensure that the vast majority of people aged 70 years and over will continue to have a medical card and only those on higher incomes will lose their entitlement.  The new income thresholds announced by the Government for persons aged 70 years and over mean that from 1 January 2009 onwards, retired Ministers, Ministers of State, judges and Secretaries General of Government Departments, to name but a few, will no longer qualify for a medical card.  Should such individuals receive a medical card?  Individuals in these groups earned enough money in their working lives.  Medical cards would be better placed in the hands of ordinary men and women who earned a modest wage during their career or do not have a substantial pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked the reason gross income is used as the threshold.  Income is any earning a person receives in the form of a pension or through investments or savings.  Under the scheme, gross income is assessed, that is, income before tax or other deductions.  It is much easier to identify what is one's gross income.  The new gross income thresholds are well in excess of the net limits of €360 and €720 for a single person and couple, respectively.  Previously, those whose income was less than these thresholds would only have qualified for a GP visit card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">It should also be noted that only the interest earned on savings is counted as income, while income from savings up to the first €36,000 for a single person and €72,000 for a couple is not counted.  However, those whose income is over the threshold may still receive a medical card if their personal or health circumstances cause them undue financial hardship.  In the event that one partner is aged 70 years, both partners will qualify for a medical card if their income is less than €1,400 per week.  In addition, the current HSE appeals mechanism will continue to apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">There will always be pressing demands on scarce national resources.  It would be a wonderful world if everyone received free medical care but unfortunately we do not live in such a utopia.</p>

          <p eId="para_1117">We must target resources at those who need them most.  It is important we devote scarce resources — taxpayers' funds — to meet the needs of those who most require health services.  Anyone with income above the threshold who has difficulty meeting his or her medical needs will be eligible to apply for a medical card under the Health Service Executive's discretionary card scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">The new arrangements do not require those currently eligible for a medical card to undergo a means test.  Everyone aged 70 years and over will be notified of the new arrangements and only those with incomes above the new threshold will be required to notify their circumstances to the HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">I sincerely regret that the issue of medical cards has been a cause of major concern.  I received many calls from concerned individuals in the days following the budget.  I hope the new arrangement will reassure people that the Government is concerned about their status.  The vast majority of people will be eligible for a medical card under the new income limits.  Only those at the top of the income bracket will not qualify for a card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">A process of intense engagement with the Irish Medical Organisation and those with particular expertise in this area was established to develop recommendations for good practice which will secure safe and effective prescribing for patients, while maximising the potential for the economy in the use of public funds.  Headed by Mr. Eddie Sullivan, the group recommended a new single capitation fee of €290 which the Government intends to implement from 1 January 2009.  The new medical card application form will be much simpler than the current form which is long, detailed and difficult to read, appraise and complete.  We are leading longer and healthier lives, for which we should plan prudently and wisely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">Like many of my colleagues, I contacted the Minister to express the concerns of widows and widowers.  I am pleased she will introduce an amendment to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">I do not agree with Deputy Olivia Mitchell that people will stop taking their medications.  Such a course of action would be a retrograde step.  I appeal to all sides not to add to the hysteria we observed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">As my colleague, Deputy Bobby Aylward, indicated, a media frenzy was whipped up on the issue of medical cards for the elderly and numerous people developed a new found interest in care for the elderly as they sought to use an opportunity to oppose the Government.  While the Government made an initial error in setting income thresholds, we were strong and humble enough to listen to people.  Accordingly, the income thresholds were adjusted upwards.  The Government will continue to honour its commitment to older people who made a valuable contribution to our country.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BeverleyCooperFlynn" eId="spk_447">
          <from>Deputy Beverley Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_1124">I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate.  The record of the Fianna Fáil Party on services for the elderly during the 11 years I have been a Deputy is a proud one.  I am particularly proud to have been a member of a party that increased pensions to their current substantial levels.  In 2001 when the universal medical card was introduced for the over 70s I saw it as recognition for people in the latter days of their lives who worry very much about their health and as a very positive development at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">As everybody knows we are now in different economic circumstances and it is difficult to make decisions of this type.  This one was particularly difficult and I, like all other Deputies in the House, received hundreds of phone calls from constituents who were very concerned.  At the time they were concerned because there was a lot of misinformation and inadequate information in the public domain.  When I contacted the hundreds of people who made contact with me and explained the new thresholds to them, all but a few cases were covered by the new threshold limits and people were satisfied.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">The initial worry and concern imposed upon people is regrettable.  I apologised on my local radio station for the concern caused to many people who should not have had to go through that.  I am conscious of elderly people and as a Deputy I have spent a lot of time over the years handling the queries of elderly people and going to active retirement meetings.  They are a group of people I have always been very careful to try and look after to the best of my ability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">We must point out the realistic features of the Bill.  The most important one is that 95% of all people over 70 will continue to have a medical card, and that cannot be highlighted enough.  Of the people who contacted me, in all but a few cases they qualified for a medical card.  I am happy the Bill makes allowances for people who are now 70 or will be 70 before 1 January.  It puts them in a position where, if they are below the income threshold, no further action on their part is required.  They will be entitled to use their medical card after 2 March, do not need to communicate with the HSE and business continues as normal.  The vast majority of people who contacted me fell into that category.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">Those who currently have the universal medical card but, will now be above the income threshold, will lose their medical card after 2 March.  That is regrettable, there are scarce means available to us now and few people are affected.  There are 350,000 people who are 70 and over, and of these approximately 330,000 will retain the medical card after 2 March.  It is important to highlight that and not worry people unnecessarily.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">Many questions were asked in the House on why the means test applies to gross income.  It is important the means test be kept as simple as possible and it is something for which the Minister has made allowance in the Bill.  It is simple in that gross income for a single person applies at the amount of more than €700 and more than €1,400 for a married couple.  Dealing in gross income allows for a simple means test and is something about which I am happy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">Those who turn 70 in the new year and whose gross income falls below the new threshold will apply to the HSE and will receive their medical card after the simple means test.  Those whose income is over the threshold will not be eligible.  However, there are a number of categories.  In addition to the new income thresholds the discretionary card is also available.  It is something I have used extensively in my constituency over the years, based on medical information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">People over the age of 70, as has been referred to by a number of Deputies, tend to become ill more and have serious health issues, and special cases can be referred to the HSE to enable such people to get a discretionary card.  I will ask the HSE to deal in a fair and balanced way throughout the country with all those who apply for the discretionary card.  I would like to see as many people as possible eligible for it.  People can also apply under the previous net means test, which is a third option.  Those that do not qualify on any of those grounds can benefit from the drugs payment scheme, which ensures no individual or family unit has to pay more than €100 for drugs or medicines each month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">There have been many references made to investments and a Deputy mentioned that investments at the present time are very volatile.  A single person can still have investments of €36,000 or a married couple €72,000 which are completely disregarded.  Only the income or interest from savings above those figures will be considered for a means test.  In a time of low interest rates, this enables people to have a substantial amount of money on bank deposit and still be in a position to qualify for a medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">There are many people, even within my constituency, who have emigrated over the years and have built up a nest egg for their old age.  I am conscious of this as I dealt with people who had money to invest in my previous career.  These people need this money; it is a cushion and a safety valve for them.  Many of them will never spend their money but they have worked very hard to be able to put a few pounds away.  It is important that those in a position to have some savings are not at a disadvantage in dealing with their medical card.  The income thresholds set for savings represent a fair amount of savings for a married couple or a single person, without it being taken into consideration.  I welcome the inclusion of this in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">I also welcome the annual review of income thresholds to take into account cost of living increases over the lifetime of this Government.  I am concerned that 95% of people — the best estimate available to the Department based on the figures available — will qualify.  It will be important over the coming years to keep the income thresholds at a level to maintain the 95% figure throughout the lifetime of the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">There are many quotes from Members of the House, even dating back to the Labour Party document in 2004 where reference was made to medical cards to over 70s.  It stated that those over 70 do not qualify on income grounds and are the highest earners in that category.  People from both sides of the House referred to the fact that those over 70 were not being means tested and perhaps the money might be better spent, and spent in a more equitable way.  They said that no-one wants to see millionaires with a medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">We are in very tight economic circumstances.  We all know families with young children and want to see the resources available directed to where they are most needed.  I have found the issue of medical cards for the over 70s very difficult and do not pretend that it was not difficult for every Deputy.  It is always difficult when one has something and it is taken away.  Giving something in the first place is always good news, and in 2001 it was very good news.  It is a difficult situation and has happened because of the economic circumstances we find ourselves in.  The income thresholds, as they are currently set, with a provision for savings, represent a fair mechanism whereby the vast majority of people will qualify for a medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">I felt the fees paid to GPs in the past for participation in the universal medical card were unacceptable.  The average person I discussed this matter with over the last number of weeks and months was shocked when they became aware of the amount paid to GPs for a person who availed of the universal medical card.  Maintaining that level of fees was unsustainable.  I welcome Mr. Sullivan's recommendations on the new single capitation fee to be paid to GPs for medical cards for the over 70s, which at €290 is fairer than the €640 paid heretofore.  When that is compared to the fee paid for a person availing of a means tested medical card people did not find it acceptable.  Members on both sides of the House recognised that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">One positive development concerns men over 70 lucky enough to be married to women who are 65 or younger — the reverse is probably not as common.  Because they are availing of the higher thresholds, many younger women who did not qualify for a medical card in the past will now benefit.  I made this point on radio in the last number of weeks and received a significant response.  There are many people who will enjoy a medical card for the first time because of the higher thresholds.  In making that point I ask the Minister to examine the issue.  I have heard the point made by Members of the Opposition about widows.  While some are now receiving the medical card because of the new system in place, a widow who is slightly above the €700 threshold may not qualify.  The Minister should re-examine that issue.  We should be compassionate in the decisions we make.  I do not believe it was the intention of the Minister to subject people to hardship when she removed universal entitlement to the medical card.  It might be possible to look at this issue in the Bill at a later stage, especially when there is a category receiving medical cards who did not previously enjoy them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the matter being discussed on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1140">I wish to share time with Deputies Sherlock and Ó Caoláin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">In listening to this debate, in particular to the contributions of the Minister and the three previous speakers, one would imagine that we were introducing for the first time new limits for people aged over 70 years.  That is not the case.  We are withdrawing the medical card from 20,000 people aged 70 years and over.  That is not a small group.  Some 20,000 people who have enjoyed the medical card until now will no longer have that luxury.  It will be withdrawn on the basis that the Government wants to save money.  That is outrageous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">The last contributor stated it was amazing that a younger woman married to an older man would now enjoy a medical card, even though she had not reached the age of 70 years.  That was the case before the Bill was introduced and she would not have had to worry about being means-tested when she reached 70 years.  It was as if this was a great Bill which was conferring benefits on people they did not already have.  However, they already had them, as they were conferred on them by legislation.  We are now withdrawing them.  It is outrageous to suggest only millionaires will be affected.  I do not know if any of us has ever sat in a doctor's surgery next to Tony O'Reilly or Michael Smurfit or their wives.  They are probably the only ones who can get doctors to make house calls these days.  We are talking about schoolteachers, gardaí, nurses and persons who have paid their contributions and ended up with a pension that is reasonable.  We were told by the Government to ensure we had pension cover that would be sufficient to sustain us in our old age.  God only knows where these pension funds are now, but that is what we were told to do.  I doubt if Michael Smurfit has applied for a medical card.  We are talking about civil servants, teachers, doctors, nurses and gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">The luxury of having a medical card was that it provided security.  If we could bottle that sense of security, we would never lose our seats.  It was about providing security in a person's old age and ensuring the roof would not fall on top of him or her.  If a person got sick, he or she would have the luxury of being able to go to the doctor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">The second last contributor told us that we did not live in utopia, that it was only in utopia that people were completely covered in respect of their health needs.  That is not true.  In most civilised European countries there is a womb to the tomb policy in the health service which is paid for from the public purse and when times get hard, as they have in other countries, vaccines that can save a woman's life are not withdrawn, nor are medical cards from the elderly.  Governments all over the world find other methods of making savings and to live up to their responsibilities.  However, the Government has decided that the two groups to be hit the hardest are young girls and the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The Minister has told us we will live longer and that a baby girl born today has the possibility of living to be 100 years old.  That might happen if she does not have cervical cancer, but the possibilities of contracting cervical cancer have been greatly increased as the vaccine will not be supplied.  It is outrageous that the Government and backbenchers should come into the House——</p>

          <p eId="para_1148">The amendment in the Bill that replaces section 45(5)(<i>a</i>) of the Health Act 1970, coupled with the fair deal legislation on nursing homes, by their very nature, seek to destroy any semblance of public provision and universality in the health care system, as it relates to older people.  The research indicates that 20,000 people who have had access to a medical card will no longer have such an entitlement.  This sends the wrong message about how the country deals with public health to those who are in their autumn years.  Notwithstanding the pre-existing deal done with general pracititioners, whereby the payment per patient would be significantly more than it is today, the health outcomes for patients in that category were significantly better as a result of having a universal right to a medical card.  For men, in particular, having the medical card meant a much greater likelihood that they would go to their GP to monitor their health.  I know of people in my constituency who were more inclined to go because they had the medical card.  From talking to GPs, I also know that they achieved far better outcomes for their patients owing to the entitlement to a medical card.  When we talk about public health and primary care provision which is woefully inadequate in the part of the country that I represent, I do not understand why the Minister would row back on a decision made to provide a medical card when the net benefit to the Exchequer is positive in terms of improved health outcomes because it keeps people out of secondary and tertiary care facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">Fianna Fáil backbenchers spoke about hysteria and the media frenzy whipped up over this issue.  The people who marched on Leinster House were not whipped up into a frenzy of hysteria.  At the time they took the rational view that their rights were being undermined.  They were rightfully fearful of the possibility that their entitlements would be taken from them in one fell swoop.  I am glad they decided to organise and exercise their right to protest.  If they had not done so, we would not be here today and the Government would not have rowed back on the position it took on this issue on budget day.  If we are to exercise public health policy correctly, it is clear that the campaign to maintain the automatic right to a medical card will need to have a positive outcome.  We need to continue in that vein.  I do not see how the Minister will be able to garner savings in this instance.  It seems that she intends to reallocate resources from those whose automatic entitlement is being withdrawn to others who might be able to avail of a medical card.  People on lower incomes will not receive a medical card in the current climate because the thresholds have not been increased sufficiently.</p>

          <p eId="para_1157">Molaim an leasú i m'ainm ag cur i gcoinne an Dara Léamh den Bhille Sláinte 2008.  I have proposed that the Dáil should decline to give a Second Reading to the Health Bill 2008.  Sinn Féin is totally opposed to the Bill because it seeks to implement one of the most callous, ill-considered and bungled decisions ever made by a Government.  Some years ago, with great fanfare, a Fianna Fáil-led Government gave everyone over the age of 70 years an automatic entitlement to a medical card.  It never ceased to boast of the benefits it had provided for older people, of which this was the centrepiece.  In the rushed budget the Government revealed once more that much of its policy was underpinned by a fundamentally flawed approach that saw vital public services not as rights but as benefits or favours that could be given and taken away at will.  The pretext for the removal of the automatic medical card entitlement of those over the age of 70 years was that it was a cost-saving measure.  Like the Government, we do not yet know what savings, if any, will accrue from this decision.  A massive wave of protest from older people forced the Government to modify the measure.  Its actions exposed the ill-considered nature of its original decision once more.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The Government has introduced a new payment for general practitioners of €290 in respect of all medical cards, including medical cards held by those over the age of 70 years.  It did this in the shortest time possible because it was facing massive political pressure.  It is clear that it did not have the political will to reset the fee before it made its bungling decision to end the automatic entitlement to the medical card of people over the age of 70 years.  The debacle exposed the appallingly bad deal for the taxpayer that the Government had negotiated when it first introduced the entitlement of people over the age of 70 years.  It allowed a far higher fee of €640 to be paid in respect of those entitled to the medical card by virtue of age alone.  Similar confusion persists in respect of the new €290 fee.  The <i>Irish Medical News</i> reports this week that the Department of Health and Children is unable to answer its queries about how the new fee will be introduced.  It states three months notice is required to terminate the current GP contract that applies to those over the age of 70 years.  I presume this means that the old fee will apply for three months after the Bill is enacted.  Is that the case?  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, to clarify this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">On the issue of costs and savings, the Minister said in the Seanad on 29 October last that the number of people over the age of 70 years who were in receipt of a medical card exceeded by 10,000 the number over the age of 70 in the State.  She explained this anomaly by saying it "probably" had resulted from "people have passed away" continuing to be "factored into the equation".  It is a damning indictment of the Minister, her Department and the HSE that, for all their bureaucracy, they are unable to ensure GPs are not paid medical card fees in respect of thousands of deceased patients.  I agree with Age Action Ireland which has pointed out that "By improving the administration of the system and taking medical cards from the dead rather than the living, (the Government) can make half its targeted savings and ensure the economic running of the scheme for all older people".</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">Similarly, the Government should listen to the words of the chairperson of the Irish Society of Physicians in Geriatric Medicine, Dr. Shaun O'Keeffe; the president of the Irish Gerontological Society, Professor Des O'Neill; and the President of the Irish Association of Social Workers, Ms Ineke Durville.  In a joint statement they warned of the impact the loss of the medical card entitlement would have for people over the age of 70 years.  While they welcomed the changes made by the Government to the initial budget proposals, they said they remained concerned about those who would lose their entitlement to a medical card:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1161">Free access to GPs facilitates preventative, as opposed to therapeutic, visits.  Older people are the most likely to suffer from chronic disease.  Optimal management of these conditions emphasises the importance of timely and frequent use of primary care to reduce personal suffering and societal health care costs, including costly hospital use.  Since the introduction of the universal over-70 medical card, the first Irish longitudinal study on ageing — Health and Social Services for Older People II — showed a major increase in preventive healthcare uptake in the over-70s.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">The three senior health and social service professionals in question pointed out that the loss of the medical card entitlement would involve the loss of services needed to keep older people with chronic illness in their own homes such as forms of medication and therapy and appliances like special beds and chairs.  As social services are underdeveloped and home care packages are means-tested, people with annual incomes of up to €36,500 can find themselves financially challenged when they try to provide the supports needed.  The three people mentioned argued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1163">Means-testing is a psychological and administrative barrier.  It will erode the benefit of the scheme and probably cost more than providing the medical card to the minority of affluent older people who want one.  Moreover, it is not only a matter of having enough money to pay for private care: for many, possession of the medical card is the essential gateway to accessing public services in circumstances where equivalent private services simply do not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">It is clear that the Bill is a retrograde step.  It flagrantly breaks the commitment made in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party and Progressive Democrats programme for Government to extend availability of the medical card.  The programme for Government promises to "index the income thresholds for medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage" and "double the income limit eligibility of parents of children under 6 years of age, and treble them for parents of children under 18 years of age with an intellectual disability".  This is the least the Government should do.  Poorer people suffer more illness and die younger.  Many never reach the age of 70 years to qualify for a medical card in the first place.  The all-island report of the Institute of Public Health, published in August, pointed out that health inequality was rife in the State.  It shows that in the Twenty-six Counties 38% of those at risk of poverty reported suffering from a chronic illness, compared to 23% of the general population.  In such circumstances, the Government is continuing to decrease people's entitlement to the medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">The partial climbdown by the Government does not go far enough.  Universal medical card entitlement for the over 70s should be fully restored.  I commend senior citizens for making their voices heard so loudly and clearly.  They rocked the Government and brought about the partial climbdown which, I emphasise, does not restore the right that has been taken away.  Sinn Féin approaches this issue from a point of principle — on the basis of health care as a right.  We believe access to health services should be based on medical need alone.  We want the State to move towards a universal public health system in which all citizens would be entitled to free health care services at the point of delivery.  The Bill represents a move in the opposite direction.  We want a universal system funded by fair and progressive taxation.  We believe working people pay taxes in order that decent public services can be provided for them and their families.  They pay taxes to ensure they are provided for in their old age.  All children and all those who are unable to work or are out of work should be properly looked after.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">Sinn Féin is in favour of a public health system that would employ general practitioners directly on set salaries.  We have the ludicrous pretence that set GP fees for patients do not exist.  We have the nonsense theory under competition law that people will shop around between GPs to find the cheapest one.  We all know that does not happen in the real world.  What has happened is that some GPs have shopped around instead.  They have concentrated in more affluent communities mainly in the cities and in Dublin in particular, leaving less well off communities with a far lower proportion of GPs per head of population.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_1169">I congratulate Deputy English and the Fine Gael Party on tabling this timely motion.  We have had numerous debates in the House on the matter.  We are speaking during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and the worst banking crisis in a century.  We recognise this is a global crisis and requires a global solution.  We in Ireland are fortunate to be participants in the eurozone.  If we were not in the EU we would now be like Iceland, which is totally bankrupt, reliant on a bailout from the International Monetary Fund and with people getting extremely angry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">Over the past decade the Government has reduced taxes and increased public spending as if it believed the boom would last forever.  When Labour was last in office and Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance, growth in public spending was 7.25% and inflation was 2%, slightly below inflation in the rest of the EU.  Between 1998 and 2001 public spending increased by 80%.  This increase occurred as we were approaching full employment which led to our inflation rate rising to 4.2%, twice the rate of our EU partners in that period.  The motion zones in upon this important point.  Price inflation inevitably led to wage inflation which in turn eroded our competitiveness.  Between 2002 and 2007 the volume of world trade increased by 50% while the volume of Irish exports of goods rose by only 10%.  Our earnings from exports of goods have stagnated since 2002 and were it not for exports of services and an inflow of investment income we might have a balance of trade deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">I disagree with the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, on this point.  The level to which public spending was increased was not the problem as there was a desperate need for most of the increases in spending.  The problem was that the increase occurred so rapidly, with little assessment of value for money in many cases and that the spending was not funded by sustainable tax revenue.  Now that the economy is in recession there is a panic-stricken attempt to suggest that we have a huge and inefficient public sector that we cannot afford.  As several reports have shown, Ireland's public sector is small compared with other EU countries and is not as inefficient as it is being portrayed.  I fully accept there is some waste and inefficiency in some areas but even a hyper-efficient system cannot deliver services similar to those in the most developed EU countries from spending what is a much smaller share of GDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">We need a reasoned debate on the public sector, what we expect from it and what we are willing to pay for it.  We must accept that we cannot have European-style social services and a US-style tax system.  Deputy Costello will speak about the accident and emergency unit charges and the impact they have.  I congratulate him on his long-running campaign on the Mater Hospital in which he has been to the forefront in trying to ensure people get a decent and sustainable service.  That is where public service money should be spent to ensure people have equity of access and treatment in the health system.  The Labour Party is focused on getting good value for the money spent on public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">The recent budget was a very ham-fisted attempt to reduce spending while the tax increases are unlikely to bring in enough revenue to significantly reduce the deficit.  A recent TNS/MRBI poll showed that those hit hardest by the budget were those on lower incomes with more than 70% of working-class and working respondents saying the budget was too tough while only 51% of middle-class families had this view.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">Export-led growth, which is the only sustainable growth for an open economy like ours, has slowed to a trickle since 2001.  Most people did not notice the end of this growth because it was replaced by the property boom.  An increase in population led to increased demand for housing which fuelled a construction boom which required more immigrant workers who needed more houses to live in.  That was a cycle which any economist not in the pay of the building industry or the banks could have predicted would end in a drastic slump.  The continuation and expansion of tax incentives for the building industry long after it was clear they were no longer necessary led to building and construction growing to 13% of GDP when the average for the rest of the EU was 5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">The survival of viable and potentially viable small and medium businesses is now threatened by the unwillingness of banks to lend, not because the businesses are at risk of failure but because the banks are desperately trying to attract deposits rather than give loans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">What needs to be done to get the economy out of this crisis?  The first thing to be done is to recall Einstein's famous observation that we cannot use the thinking that created the problem to solve it.  As the present Government and its predecessors have squandered so much of the fruits of the boom the options available are limited and some of the measures announced recently may make matters worse rather than better.  The Government has increased VAT just as the UK has reduced it, giving shoppers an even greater incentive to shop in Northern Ireland.  We then have nauseating appeals to "patriotism" in consumers by a Government which has allowed the cost of living for lower income families to rise through the various charges Deputy Costello will outline while setting up a tax regime over the years that enabled many of the super wealthy to pay no tax at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">Several local authorities are increasing commercial rates at a time when many small and medium businesses are struggling to survive.  The Government has left many local authorities short of income with local authority workers being laid off.  I note that Westmeath County Council is facing a reduction of €13 million and the council will struggle to maintain those in permanent employment.  Commercial businesses face enough threats without commercial rates being added.  Many people will be at their wits' end trying to pay the existing service charges.  I call on the Government to increase the allocation to local authorities to ensure they will not be levying such rates on small businesses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_456">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_1178">I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing time.  I compliment Deputy English and his party on tabling this valuable Private Members' motion.  I agree with Deputy Penrose's final point on the need for the Government to invest considerably more funding in local authorities so that much needed local authority work can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">The Minister of State will be aware of today's announcement that the number of families looking for social and affordable housing under local authorities' remit has increased from 43,000 to 56,000.  The irony is that at a time when the economy was booming, particularly the construction industry, which constructed far too many private houses, far too few public housing projects were completed.  In my constituency almost €2 billion worth of regeneration projects that were to have been built through public private partnerships have gone down the tubes.  There is no investment and we are desperately trying to get local authority or Government funding to fill the gap.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">I attended a meeting last night with residents of O'Devaney Gardens to try to reassure them that they would not be left in the lurch.  It has already taken ten years to try to get the various administrations to inject the funding and get the development to proceed.  We are no closer to it than we were when the entire process started.  Tonight I have heard that another public private partnership in my constituency, the Croke Villas development, has collapsed.  We will need to push the boulder up the same way unless the Government is prepared to invest money in the local authority and take up those projects itself.  This would provide much-needed public service projects that would provide housing for the people who need it and employment for those in the construction industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">The Government amendment to the motion is a work of fiction as the Minister of State must agree.  The first line states "commends the Government on the prudent management of the economy in the face of difficult domestic and international trading conditions".  Who in their right minds would commend the Government for the prudent management of the economy?  It has made a dog's dinner of the economy in recent years.  This is the third Administration the Minister of State's party has been in and the situation has gone from bad to worse.  The second line states "welcomes the continued job creation and confidence expressed in our economy by business investors and the number of recent investment decisions taken across a range of sectors in the regions". Did we lose 17,000 jobs last month?  That is the figure but, according to the Minister of State, we have confidence in the economy and jobs are being created.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">Let us look at the retail sector.  The Minister of State's last point concerned value for money for consumers and support for the Irish retail sector.  Everybody is going across the Border.  One cannot get into Newry now.  There are queues of three, four and five hours on weekends.  My constituents go up from Dublin to purchase in Belfast, going on the train or driving.  It is the same right across the Border, on the line from Galway to Dublin.  That is where the retail sector is suffering.  What is the Government doing about it?  It introduced the stealth taxes we have seen in so many areas.  It increased VAT on goods and the situation is going from bad to worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">In my view, the Government is doing zilch.  There is no plan.  When the Minister of State gets a plan and tells us what it is, then we can get out there and see whether we can make some progress in getting the economy back up and running.</p>

          <p eId="para_1186">We had the debate earlier, in a different form, but with the same issues.  Today during Question Time we dealt with some of the issues that were raised here.  Although Deputy Penrose may disagree with my views on the public sector, nonetheless there is commentary within the OECD report which suggests certain changes should be made and that certain reforms are necessary.  All I ask is that the culture and systems within that sector would change.  Then we would have a system that we could all be proud of, including those who work in it.  It would deliver effectively and efficiently in very difficult times on behalf of this country and it would offer a measurement against the rest of Europe in terms of benchmarking and how we are perceived abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">There was mention of other projects, where money was lost.  It is true we lost money on certain projects.  I sat on the Committee of Public Accounts as its Vice Chairman and most of my views are informed by that experience.  Changes were made there in the wake of initial controversy and discovery of losses that brought about savings in terms of fixed price contracts.  That proves that a committee of the House functions very well and is worthwhile.</p>

          <p eId="para_1194">——times are not experienced only by Ireland.  They are worldwide.  Every country has experience of that at one stage or another.  I explained this.  The Government is measured by how it manages the economy, how it puts in place the policies and the funding to deal with the issue, and by the confidence it has in different sectors.  In the sector for which I am responsible, namely, the county enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland etc, we put our money where our mouth is.  An increase of 16% went to county enterprise boards.  The companies that operate within those boards and within Enterprise Ireland are experiencing difficulty and they are looking to the Government for guidance, direction and leadership.  That is what we are giving them by the direction we are taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">I said earlier there is a need to look at the economy now and to consider how we might develop the actions and policies of county enterprise boards while we continue to increase by 16% their funding.  That will allow them to engage with small and medium enterprises that create 800,000 jobs in this country.  I acknowledge that to be the case, against the odds.  I was at a conference last week attended by 400 women who were enthusiastic about getting involved in business.  In second level schools 12,000 students participate in a scheme that encourages a spirit of enterprise and grows the notion of starting and being involved in business.  That is an indication of how, in spite of what is happening, in this country there is a solid increase in business and in the numbers of people creating employment for themselves.  Every month 2,700 enterprises are registered and over half of those are run by women.  A total of €190 million has been spent by Governments since 1993 in support of the small and medium enterprise sector and 35,000 jobs were created through the experience with county enterprise boards.</p>

In my view, small and medium enterprises, county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland are central to what we must do as we move into better times.  To do that we must restore confidence within those companies.  We must ensure credit is made available.  It is no harm in the course of this debate, whether it comes from this side of the House or the other, to send a specific message to the banks and tell them they must look at themselves and how they make credit available.</p>

That is unforgivable in the economic situation we are experiencing.  It shows that we must understand we are all in this together.  It is not just Government policy that will take us out of this and it is not just the banks on their own that will make that credit facility available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">The banks should expedite their engagements with the European Investment Bank to ensure we have the appropriate level of funding available for the SME sector.  In recent times I met with the Small Firms Association and with other individual business organisations and people involved in business.  I suggested to them that perhaps we should look again at county enterprise boards and see if, by way of policy some money might be taken from the National Treasury Management Agency and be made available to the boards.

          <p eId="para_1203">We have made choices in the course of this situation.  Deputy Costello mentioned the trail across the Border, for example.  I understand the difficulties towns have in that necklace across the Border between North and South.  I was at a conference and saw at first hand the traffic jams as one goes into Newry and elsewhere.  However, it must be understood that if we were to decrease the VAT rate we would reduce our take by €3 billion a year.  We make choices in terms of our taxes and in the directions we take and the policy we make.  Our decision with regard to VAT was to have it at that level.  The United Kingdom came afterwards and did something different.  We must protect the jobs that exist in the retail area and we must understand that local authorities have a role to play in this too.  I can give as an example my local authority the chamber of commerce in Kilkenny.  This season they launched vouchers for shoppers to attract them back to the retail business in their own centre.  The IFA carried out an analysis of a shopping basket north and south of the Border and found there was only €6 in the difference.</p>

The real threat, of course, is deflation.  There will be problems, in fact, if inflation goes below 2%.  It is not good for the economy to have inflation at such a low level.

The Government amendment to the motion, which I agree with and support, mentions jobs, confidence in the economy, tax issues, inflation, and the national development plan — all the broader issues that are affecting the wider public.  They are the important issues.  Inflation is not an important issue at the moment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
          <p eId="para_1223">Inflation is coming down, and in fact deflation is a possible problem.  We certainly do not want that to happen because it would be an utter disaster for the economy.  We must talk up the economy, because talking up prices, when we are approaching deflation and prices are not increasing, is actually good for the economy provided it is moderated to an extent.  The Government amendment mentions job creation, prudent management of the economy, taxation issues, inflation, the strategy for science, technology and innovation, the national skills strategy, the national development plan, and the Commission for Energy Regulation — a gamut of issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">Another of the items mentioned is cross-Border shopping.  This is a difficult issue for traders in County Meath and in the town of Drogheda near where I live.  However, it is also a difficult issue for the people who are travelling across the Border to shop.  I must say on their behalf that in difficult economic times I cannot blame them for looking for better prices.  However, they must bear in mind when they do so the negative consequences for the local economy arising from the legitimate choice they make to shop in the North, in Newry or wherever.  They should also look around their own areas.  I am glad to see in my local supermarkets and shops unprecedented bargains which people would see if only they would look.  We as politicians, with our chambers of commerce, can get the message out that stock is reduced in clothes shops, hardware shops and electrical shops across the board.  There are two boxes of cereal for the price of one or two boxes of Christmas biscuits for the price of one in various supermarkets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">That is the message we have to get across — that it is worth people's while to shop in their local area.  We should not give out to them or criticise them because it is a difficult choice for them to make and I do not think they want to make it.  We must make it attractive for them to shop in their own areas.  Certainly, in my constituency, shops are making the effort.  They are seeing the threat from the competition and they are moving forward on that basis.  However, it is difficult for them, particularly with sterling hitting new lows this morning.  This is good for cross-Border shops but not very good for the overall economy in the UK.  We must encourage shoppers to see the value in their own areas and to shop there, because it does have an impact.  While I recognise their right to shop in the North and the difficulties they are facing, they must bear in mind the consequences for the economy, for jobs and for their own families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">I commend the Government on its handling of the economy.  We are facing difficult challenges we can only deal with in an international context.  We need to consider the broader issues and not what is at this point the irrelevant issue of inflation, which the irrelevant Opposition has put forward as the main subject of its motion.</p>

That is why the strategy being put forward by this Government, which some people continue to fail to recognise, is about stabilising the economy and the banking sector and investing in infrastructure.  The buzz word all over the world is "stimulus package".  We have had our own stimulus package here for many years.  It is called the national development plan.  We are on our second or third version of it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_1249">One need only look in my area to see what we are doing in the mid-west.  We are investing in the western rail corridor; we are investing in the Atlantic corridor, which is the road network from Donegal to Waterford; we are investing in the tunnel under the Shannon; we have invested in the infrastructure of the airport, and we are continuing to do that.  It is in this way that we will re-establish confidence in the economy.  We are doing it in education.  We are putting extra funding into the building programme this year to try to stimulate the economy.  As Deputy Byrne said, it is mighty dangerous to start talking down the economy when inflation is reduced.  Yes, it looks good, but when one goes below that threshold one moves into a downward spiral which has an entirely negative effect on the economy.  The Government, in my view, is taking a very prudent approach.  It is about rebalancing and economic stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">We are also limiting borrowing.  We have seen in the past the damage that large-scale borrowing for current spending has done.  It effectively negates the efforts of the Government and future Governments to provide services for the citizens of the future who will be overburdened with debt if we are not able to manage at this time.  We must move beyond this by taking decisive action which will lead to long-term stability.  It will also help that we will be able to become more competitive as an economy.  For far too long we have been losing good quality jobs in the IT sector and indeed in the semi-skilled and skilled manufacturing sectors to lower cost economies.  There is an opportunity here for us to recalibrate our competitiveness and reduce our costs, but to do so in a way that does not damage the overall economy.  We could not proceed with the kind of nonsense that is coming from the other side.  Although there is a global downturn, Opposition Deputies are suggesting that we can just put our heads up and continue as before.  That is a mighty foolish approach to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">As Deputy Byrne said, inflation is coming down, and is below the EU average.  Job creation is fundamental.  We know that from our agencies: IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and, in my region, Shannon Development.  These do an exceptionally good job of targeting and encouraging investment, not just from indigenous companies, but also from the wider world in the form of foreign direct investment.  We can see what has happened even in the last couple of days.  There is a global economic crisis, yet in the last two or three weeks there have been announcements of significant numbers of jobs to be created in Cork and Wexford.</p>

Of course, I will be asking the Minister to ensure that Shannon is included in this and that we get significant investment in the industrial zone there to offset the job losses that have occurred recently at Element Six and others.  I also take this opportunity to say to Aer Lingus that it removed the Shannon-Heathrow service last year on the basis that the cost base at Shannon was too high, but the workers have now put forward an aggressive cost-cutting plan.  They have put the interests of the region well before their own personal interests.  It is time Aer Lingus recognised that and immediately reinstated the Heathrow-Shannon link.  It is vital to the continued competitiveness of the region, it is vital for connectivity and it is vital for the maintenance and growth of the job market in the region.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_517">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Jimmy Devins)</from>
          <p eId="para_1254">I welcome the opportunity to address the House this evening.  There are two issues I would like to talk about, which were raised last night.  I want to deal with the national skills strategy, and I will also explain to the House the elements of our innovation strategy.  The safeguarding of Ireland's competitiveness and future prosperity requires us to maintain advantage over our competitors in a number of vital areas.  The skills and competencies level of our labour force is one such area.  This Government firmly believes that our future success can only be guaranteed by continuing our policy of investing in our education and training systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">With free primary, secondary and third level education, combined with significant Government investment in vocational education and training, Ireland is well placed to take her place on the world stage as a star performer in the global knowledge economy.  We are continuing to produce highly educated and skilled individuals.  We will ensure that we have a labour force with the ability to meet the needs of enterprises and, more important, that will allow Ireland to respond quickly to emerging opportunities in the future.  In other words, we must create and develop competitive advantage in terms of the skills and qualifications of our labour force.  This will be key to maintaining our success and will allow us to continue to compete in the increasingly competitive global marketplace.  Lifelong learning will therefore play a key role in enabling Ireland to remain competitive in the future.  Compared with other countries, participation by adults in education and training is still significantly underdeveloped here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">Greater participation in lifelong learning by facilitating and motivating people to increase their skill levels and qualifications will be promoted and encouraged.  Key to achieving this goal is the national skills strategy.  To underpin long-term competitiveness our objective is to ensure that we build up the productive capacity of the economy through investing in people.  This is being achieved directly through the science, technology and innovation strategy and through our skills strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">The national skills strategy was published in March 2007 and was completed by the expert group on future skills needs in response to the Government's request for the group to undertake a comprehensive analysis of Ireland's labour market and skills needs to the year 2020.  The results of the analysis contain an ambitious vision for the skills profile in Ireland in 2020.  It shows that if we are to progress ahead of our competitors then we need to increase our focus on skills development at a number of levels.  We need to upskill by at least one level on the national framework of qualifications an additional 500,000 people by 2020.  The strategy clearly shows that the majority of these people, in excess of 330,000, are currently considered to be low skilled.  The implementation of the vision needs to have a special focus on the low skilled.  In this way our workforce will have the skills to compete globally for jobs and investment.  The national skills strategy has helped us to target specific skills and sectors that will become increasingly important in the next few years.  It has allowed us to identify and address specific gaps in our skills base.  It will help us to build an education and training system that will allow us to adapt and respond quickly to the changing global business environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">The Government is committed to ensuring that the labour force is characterised by progressively improved skill levels reflecting the changing business needs of the labour market.  An interdepartmental committee chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for lifelong learning, Deputy Seán Haughey, will complete an implementation plan for the national skills strategy by the end of this year.  This implementation plan will examine the existing provision of education and training and determine the key initiatives required to achieve the objectives of the national skills strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">Our future competitiveness and success as an economy and a society rest within our own hands.  Targeting our investment in education and training to achieve the objectives of the national skills strategy will provide Ireland with competitive advantage in the key area of skills.  Ireland's workforce will continue to be the basis of our success.  I have the utmost confidence in the ability of our workforce to compete successfully with the best in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">Our knowledge economy ambitions have to be underpinned by flexible ways of doing and organising business and how we innovate in all sectors of the economy.  We are examining several ways of fostering an innovation culture in the economy and in society.  In leading innovative countries, almost every policy domain is connected to innovation. It is therefore essential that we continue to maintain the best possible conditions across all policy spheres for supporting and sustaining innovation.  We recently launched our innovation policy statement, Innovation in Ireland, which reinforces our efforts to create a framework for increasing innovation in the economy.  The statement maps our progress across ten key policy areas and identifies opportunities where innovation can be better exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">My Department is currently working in key areas including the strategy for science, technology and innovation; research and development; and public procurement and services.  The first report on the implementation of the strategy for science, technology and innovation, 2006-2013, will be published tomorrow.  This report illustrates the success of the strategy to date.  The first report shows that total research and development spending has almost trebled over ten years.  Ireland's total expenditure on research and development had risen to 1.56% of GNP at end 2006.  Higher education research and development spending has almost quadrupled in current terms over ten years and is now at the EU and OECD average levels.  This increased investment in the higher education sector is having a significant impact in terms of human capital development, leading to the attraction of foreign direct investment and commercialisation.  This is paralleled by equally dynamic growth in business sector research and development which has risen to an estimated €1.56 billion in 2006, a 17% increase on the previous year.  Over the lifetime of the strategy, as Government investment in public sector research increases, it is a key objective to retain our two to one ratio of private to public sector investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">Enterprise Ireland and IDA continue to work closely with companies to strengthen the research and technological base of the enterprise sector.  The strategic infrastructure investment of the programme for research in third level institutions and increased PhD output, combined with Science Foundation Ireland's success in growing our human capital at the highest level, adding more than 30 world class principal investigator teams each year, and our success in connecting funded research teams with industry are together transforming what Ireland has to offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">Collaboration between SFI researchers and industry has increased significantly.  Science Foundation Ireland's centres for science, engineering and technology, known as CSETS, have engaged with a wide range of industrial and other partners.  The growing bank of researcher talent, coupled with the enhanced research and development tax credit, is a major factor for the IDA in attracting blue chip foreign direct investment and research and development into Ireland.  This has resulted in a series of significant industrial and academic research collaborations.  It is particularly welcome that as many as 40% of the 114 new projects negotiated by the IDA in 2007 were research and development investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">Positive trends are also evident in early stage commercialisation.  The number of real start-ups from the research investment has increased from five in 2005 to 13 in 2007; licences have tripled in number from 15 in 2003 to 55 in 2007; invention disclosures have grown from 135 in 2005 to 264 in 2007; incubator employment has gone from 135 in 2005 to 264 in 2007.  While Ireland is still a relative newcomer to significant investment in research and development, the trends are very positive in light of the time lags that exist between investments and eventual outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1265">The remit of Science Foundation Ireland was expanded from ICT and biotechnology to include the broad thematic area of sustainable energy and energy efficient technologies.  A range of measures is supported by Enterprise Ireland to develop collaborative links between industry and academic researchers.  These include innovation vouchers, innovation partnerships, industry-led research networks and competence centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">The strategy supports a strategic and coherent approach to developing science teaching in primary and second level education, through the programmes piloted by Discover Science and Engineering, run in close co-operation with the curriculum support services.  The overall objectives of Discover Science and Engineering are to increase the number of students studying the physical sciences and to promote a positive attitude to careers in science, engineering and technology.  A major international review of DSE's work in this area has just been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">Good progress is being made in supporting and developing North-South co-operation in research and development via a North-South innovation fund.  An early win has been the agreement of an all-island innovation voucher scheme last month and SFI has developed a dedicated support mechanism to encourage researchers from the North to connect with SFI-funded researchers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1272">I have many points to make.  Some of the Minister of State's colleagues decided to insult the people by slagging off the motion.  It is wrong to maintain that this motion is a waste of time and is not the basis of a proper debate.  Our motion reflects the reality of major problems facing businesses, such as increased Government charges.  Petrol, diesel and oil are much dearer in Ireland than in the rest of Europe.  Many people are travelling to the North to spend their shopping money there.  These are serious matters.  For Government Deputies to throw mud at these issues is insulting to the hardworking and hard-pressed people who expect the Government to take action and make changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">I will not blame the Government for every problem.  I accept international factors are causing problems for our economy.  However, these have been compounded by the Government's lack of action when it could make changes and improvements to keep prices and business costs down.  By doing so, the Government would protect jobs, make it easier for people to spend money in the country and make exports more competitive.  These problems, however, are compounded by bad government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">Last night the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment spoke about what retailers need to do.  The Government has a stake in this and there is much it can do.  The Government talks about retailers getting the message out to people that they do not save money by shopping across the Border.  That is a job with which the Government can help.</p>

          <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
          <p eId="para_1276">The Government is not doing it.  The Minister of State gave a lovely speech about skills, which I agreed with, but it did not address the motion.  Government Members keep on slagging off our motions.  The reason we keep putting them down is that we want to get real debates to come up with solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">The Government fell asleep at the wheel.  When it woke up, it took all the wrong actions at the wrong time.  It increased the VAT rate when our EU counterparts decreased it.  Petrol and diesel prices were 20% higher than the average EU price in October and November.  Hopefully, they will be reduced over the next few months.  However, this side of the House expects the Government to take a role in driving these prices down more quickly.  Of course, there might be an incentive for the Government not to act on fuel prices.  Up to 70% of the price at the pumps ends up in the Government's coffers through duty.  This is one area where the Government could act to reduce business costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">Last night we argued for and against a reduction in the VAT rate, a topic I do not wish to go over again.  However, the Government could take some pressure off businesses by allowing them to reschedule their payments of VAT and taxes to Revenue.  It has been done by the UK tax authorities but in Ireland I am getting reports of the opposite.  Revenue is putting pressure on businesses to pay up their taxes and VAT earlier and more quickly.  Revenue is normally reasonable to deal with and often will allow people to push their payment schedules over 12 months.  I believe it is doing the opposite now, coming down hard on businesses, on the Government's instruction.  The Government can address this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">Council rates, development levies and parking charges are putting serious pressure on retailers and small businesses.  This is a direct result of the Government cutting the percentage funding per scheme to local authorities.  Local authorities then have to raise more money locally.  The only way to do that is to hit small businesses.  The day is gone when small businesses could sustain ever increasing local government charges.  These need to be reduced and that is where the Government can play a role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">I see people leaving towns in County Meath such as Navan, Kells and Trim to shop elsewhere.  Who can blame them if they believe they will get bargains elsewhere?  There is a duty on us to drive retail business costs down to help reduce retail prices.  We could make it easier and more attractive for people to shop in our towns and villages, rather than going to the North, if parking charges were reduced and more park-and-ride facilities provided.  The Government may argue that is the responsibility of local government but it does not have the funding to provide these services.  It needs help from central Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">Last night the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment claimed reports due out in a few weeks will show there is a 5% difference in the cost of doing business in the North and in the South.  That is untrue.  The real difference is between 25% and 30%.</p>

I accept some retailers in the North of Ireland are able to avail of economies of scale in the UK.  That is why we have to drive other economies of scale.  We cannot just say there is nothing we can do about it.  We have a duty to protect jobs and need to act to bring costs down in doing that.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, spoke about the role of county enterprise boards.  Their remits need to be expanded to examine job protection, not just job creation, in this economic climate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_1293">I remember that committee fondly, which is why I am referring to it.  It did good work on grocery prices through an exhaustive examination of what contributes to grocery costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">The then Government promised, following a report from the then chairman of the Competition Authority, that it could reduce the cost of a typical basket of household goods by €500 million per annum if the groceries order were reformed.  Until the reform of the order, prices of food products were rising by 1.7% per annum, which took into account escalating input, labour and energy costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">The Minister believed the rhetoric of the then chairman of the Competition Authority, Mr. Fingleton, and his successor, Mr. Prasifka, which had an ideological tinge to it.  They suggested if State intervention were taken away in the supply of goods and services to the grocery market, prices to the consumer would be reduced.  What has happened since the groceries order was removed has been nothing short of a catastrophe for the consumer, however.  There has been an 18% increase in the cost of a typical basket of household food products.  There has been no apology from the Minister responsible for this debacle, Deputy Martin.  Deputy Micheál Martin is a Minister well known for reading his brief and he must get assistance in these matters on a regular basis.  He never apologises to the consumer, whether in the health area or in enterprise, trade and employment, for the damage he has done.  The consumer is picking up the tab for the mistakes he has made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">There is a 37% reduction in volume in the normal weekly shopping in Border counties.  This is the message from retailers and RGDATA, whom I rang today to check the figures.  That is a savage reduction and extends further down the country, with a 10% reduction in volume in Drogheda.  Dublin is also affected by the fact that there is a more competitive atmosphere in which to shop in companies on the other part of the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">It is interesting that the republican party has a problem with people shopping in Newry.  That is the hypocrisy we must deal with from time to time.  We need transparency and a better response from Government.  The UK has reduced VAT and given assistance to small businesses in respect of corporation tax.  We are asking small businesses in this jurisdiction to pay tax in November, even though they will not have calculated profits until 31 December.  In order to fill a gap in finances, successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance bring forward a payment, whether capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax or corporation tax.  That is not the way to do business in a planned way.  Would it not be better to wait for the Christmas season so that retailers can pay tax in January?  At least they would know whether they have made the money.  To estimate tax at this time of the year is like the Lotto.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">Fianna Fáil policy on the groceries trade and small business has pushed larger profits into the hands of larger multinationals.  It has squeezed suppliers and lost employment.  We now know what the toothless National Consumer Agency, set up as a fig leaf to give some indication that the then Minister, Deputy Martin, was doing something, is able to do nothing.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1299">I refer to two points that Deputy Hogan spoke about.  The Minister for Finance spoke about patriotism and Fianna Fáil always wraps the green flag around itself when it is in difficultly.  I am very surprised that Fianna Fáil is complaining about people crossing the Border.  Since the foundation of the State, Fianna Fáil has never recognised the Border.  It always said the Six Counties were part of Ireland, and I agree.  I do not see any difference if people shop in the South or the North.  I am surprised because Fianna Fáil was a great party for wrapping that old green flag around it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">Deputy Hogan spoke about rip-off Ireland.  They are talking about wearing the green jersey again.  When some businesses had the opportunity, they ripped the jerseys from the men and women of this country and robbed them left, right and centre — rip-off, rip-off, rip-off.  There is a God above, times turn and times change.  Now they must compete.  What really upsets me is that we had a Government and a Minister who did nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">With the petrol and diesel price problem, what did the Government do when retailers would not bring down the price while the country was on its knees?  Petrol and diesel were being bought on the world trade market at a reasonable price, but retailers here would not pass the price on.  There was no patriotism there.  Now the time has come when the Government should deal with these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">Small businesses have been attacked by Fianna Fáil, which always talked about being the party of small business.  They have hurt, attacked and robbed small businesses.  Last week, I was travelling on the N5 and went through the toll.  A sign informed me that from next Monday the toll fee would increase by 10 cent because of the rise in VAT.  I calculated it at home and the VAT increase was 1.5 cent.  Rip-off Ireland is still at its best and they charge people 10 cent instead of 1.5 cent.  That has been going on for too long and now they want people to be patriots and pay above the odds.  Businesses should make prices competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">It is time we took on Tesco and Marks &amp; Spencer.  Why should they charge Irish citizens more than they charge citizens in Britain?  Why does our Government not bring them into the Department and tell them that if they want to trade in Ireland they must treat our people equally, not charging them dearer prices than in England?</p>

          <p eId="para_1306">Small businesses cannot carry local authorities any longer, paying water charges, refuse charges, rates and benchmarking for local authority workers.  The Minister and the Government should write to every county manager drawing up estimates to say that there should be no increases in rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">In the town I come from, Westport, the taxpayers of Ireland and Europe helped to buy much of the land for Irish Rail and helped to set up the rail service.  What did Irish Rail do with the land around the town?  It started to charge for parking on ground the taxpayer worked hard for and provided funding for.  Irish Rail is ripping off the consumer again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">Let us have fair play.  Let us protect and help the consumer.  I want Irish business to do well and make a fair profit but I want them to stop continually ripping us off.  They have been at it for the past 20 years and it is time for some competition in the market.  The Minister should bring in Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco and tell them to charge the same as they are charging in Britain.  If they do not like dealing in this country, they can go because they are the ones that put many small businesses out of business in this country.  They are still at it and the Government has made it easy for them in regard to planning laws.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_1309">This motion addresses two serious economic difficulties we have had for a number of years, but particularly this year.  I refer to the rapidly rising rate of unemployment.  It is unbelievable that we have lost well over 100,000 jobs in Ireland in the past year.  In Donegal unemployment has increased by 60% to 70%.  It is due to the fact that we have allowed things to get out of control and have charged ourselves out of the labour market.  I refer particularly to the 12,000 jobs we have lost in Donegal in the past ten years.  These jobs are not lost to the world economy; they are simply being transferred from Donegal to eastern Europe, north Africa, Mexico and the Far East.  It is entirely due to the way we are taxing industry and jobs.  The Government bears a major share of the responsibility.  It will get worse unless we do something about it and enact the proposals made by our spokesman in this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">I represent a Border constituency, like some previous speakers on this motion.  My constituency stretches from Bundoran in the south along the Border almost to the city of Derry.  Every day of the week I see so many of our people crossing the Border and spending their money in shops in Derry and Strabane.  I do not blame the housewife for doing that.  We know that times are difficult and when they see the bargains on the other side of the Border, across they go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">I met someone last Monday who for the first time ever went to a grocery place in Strabane and spent £120 or €140.  When she came back she went through the list and priced it in comparison to what she would pay at home.  Her calculations showed a saving €70 on a basket of groceries.  The retailers in Northern Ireland are sensible people and canny traders.  Some are offering €1 per £1, which will exacerbate a difficult situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">I met someone in Dublin last night who had been to Omagh.  He went into a multinational in Dublin to buy an energy saving light bulb for which he paid 97 cent.  In the equivalent shop in Omagh, he bought five bulbs for £1.  That is a huge discrepancy, which the Government must address.  As Deputy Hogan said, the Government has established toothless quangos, which cannot deliver the goods or control the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">I compliment our spokesman for tabling the motion.  Small businesses throughout the country and, particularly along the Border, are in serious difficulty because of the haemorrhaging of finance across the Border.  A euro spent in Northern Ireland has as detrimental an effect as a euro spent in the US, Tenerife or Spain.  It is a drain on the economy and it will cost jobs and income in the long run.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomSheahan" eId="spk_540">
          <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
          <p eId="para_1314">The consumer is hit by everything that impinges on the retailer and the severity of the hits over the past number of years that retailers have had to take from the Government have impinged on the consumer.  For example, County Kerry has the second highest local authority rate in the country, which is hard to believe, given we have probably the second worst infrastructure.  When I was young, my family had a small shop for which my parents paid a rate that covered water, sewerage and refuse services provided by the local authority.  A rate was not struck by Kerry County Council this year.  Councillors have had several budget meetings but they have been unable to strike a rate.  However, for a peripheral county such as Kerry to have the second highest valuation rate in the State is absolutely crazy.  I support the county manager, who is trying to keep the rate as low as he can as he tries to balance the books while facing a reduction of between 8% and 10% in the amount he will receive from the local authority fund this year.  However, he is well aware that next February councillors expect up to 100 small businesses to go to the wall in the county because of charges that are passed on to the consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">As Deputy McGinley said, it is difficult to fault people travelling across the Border to shop but the Government has played a major role in this because the Northern Ireland authorities have not had to promote or advertise their businesses because we have done it for them.  Print and broadcast media highlight the queues into Newry every day and people's natural instinct is to want to visit Newry to see what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">Small businesses are suffering because of the rate.  While VAT is not applied to food, it is applied to luxury items.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance asking him whether in his wisdom he believed a telephone was a necessity or a luxury for doing business.  I also asked separately whether he believed Internet access and broadband were necessities or luxuries in the context of business.  He replied that he did not understand both questions.  Businesses must pay VAT on the use of telephones and Internet access.  This is detrimental to the expansion of indigenous industry and this impacts negatively on foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">The tourism, hospitality and food sectors, which include restaurants, hotels, delicatessens and butcher shops, are being destroyed by over regulation.  They are being hammered by environmental health officers, EHOs, week in, week out.  When such regulation was needed over the past few months to save the pig industry, it did not happen.  Farmers and ancillary businesses were hit by over regulation by EHOs but they did not do their job to save the industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_1318">The motion is extremely timely, as it returns the focus to value for money and rip-off Ireland.  We thought that because of the exposure generated by Eddie Hobbs a few years ago, we would not hear about rip-offs anymore.  However, small and medium-sized businesses always have been and always will be the backbone of employment in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">I do not have time to go into many issues but energy costs are very important for every businessperson.  This was an unusual year for the pricing of petrol and diesel.  When the price of oil on the world's commodity markets peaked at $147 a barrel in July, the price of petrol and diesel at the pumps increased significantly and, generally, people bought it, with some feeling they were lucky to get it, which was the conditioning at the time.  However, in recent months the price of oil reduced gradually to only $40 a barrel in recent days, yet the price at the pumps did not decrease proportionately.  Someone made a great deal of money in the interim and that raises a question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">A €23 million sewerage scheme will commence in Tuam, County Galway, over the next month or two.  The local people also want broadband and natural gas and one would expect that all the cabling, pipes and so on would be laid during one big dig.  However, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government can only pay for the pipes for the sewerage scheme while the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources does not have the money for a broadband scheme, nor does Bord Gáis for the gas spur.  Nobody is in charge of the shop, although the sewerage scheme will be completed in a year or two.  The streets will probably then be dug up the year after and, with a bit of luck, they will be dug up a third time.  If this is joined-up thinking I do not know who is in charge of the shop.</p>

          <p eId="para_1321">I wish to respond to a few issues raised by various Deputies during the course of the debate.  With regard to consumers and competition, recently the Tánaiste met a cross-section of retailers and had a good exchange of views with them on the preliminary findings of a Forfás study on the relative cost of doing business North and South.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">There is a misunderstanding with regard to the preliminary findings of this study.  The study showed that higher operating costs for labour, property, energy and other utilities in the retail sector in the Republic justify a price differential of approximately 5% with Northern Ireland for grocery items and approximately 7.5% for goods in department stores.  However, as we are all aware the gap is a great deal higher than this.  Something is happening because the study shows that there is a 5% extra cost to business in the Republic in the context of labour, property, energy and other utilities.  We must be honest with ourselves.  We will continue to pursue this to ensure retailers get value for money.</p>

          <p eId="para_1355">This is the second time in two weeks we have had a Private Members' debate focussing on the business sector.  The previous debate was on the small business sector in particular and we urged the Government to support small businesses and help to ensure that credit was available to them at a crucial time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">In recent weeks, we have seen small businesses take another hit, particularly those in the Border region.  Many speakers in this debate mentioned the large queues shown in the media of consumers moving elsewhere to purchase products and groceries.  Who can blame them?  The consumer will always follow prices and this is the nature of the beast.  If prices are cheaper in another jurisdiction people will go there.  We have seen the queues going to Newry and heard about the devastating effect this is having on businesses in the Border region.  The weakness of sterling against the euro does not help those operating in this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">Not many people from Cork will go to Newry to do their shopping.  However, I know of many people flying to Manchester and London in the UK on day trips and buying small goods, small electrical goods, computer games, Christmas gifts, clothes and other items.  It is happening in other areas but perhaps it is not as obvious.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">The appeal of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to Irish people to be patriotic and to stay at home to do their shopping will not ring true with anybody.  People want to see action from the Government to ensure factors which contribute to high costs here can be reduced.  Increasing VAT, even if it is by 0.5%, is going in the wrong direction.  If anything we should see a reduction in inflation, encourage people to spend money and send out a more positive message in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">We hear this country is an expensive place to do business.  The Small Firms Association and ISME regularly come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment outlining the costs they face.  As local authorities begin the process of setting commercial rates, Fine Gael has asked them to be conscious of small businesses and, where possible, to ensure that commercial rates are not increased.  I am glad to have read today that Cork County Council will not increase commercial rates.  I am disappointed Dublin City Council increased them by 3% as this will be another burden on businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">Areas under the control of the Government that can be effective in reducing the burden on businesses include waste and water charges.  In Cork, we have a serious problem as the water treatment plant in Little Island in which we had major investment has resulted in an increase in costs to businesses which now have to pay for water going in and water coming out.  This was not in their reckoning as many people thought that money for the treatment plant was coming from Europe through the Cohesion Fund.  The cost of running the facility is an enormous burden on businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">We do not have domestic water charges.  However, from a business point of view there is no transparency in the charges administered by local authorities.  There is no way of knowing what is the contribution from Government to the local authority fund.  These are the issues which are frustrating for people.  They feel there is no transparency and they are lumbered with costs.  These are areas which the Government can control.  It should be the case that something as important as the contribution to domestic water charges is a defined item so businesses can clearly see what the local authorities are charging and that it is a fair price.  That type of transparency does not currently exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">I am sure there was an open and frank exchange of views when the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, met recently with retailers.  I assume the latter did not waste the opportunity to outline the costs they face both in terms of local authority charges, as I have indicated, and energy costs.  In August, for example, electricity charges were increased by 17.5%, while gas prices rose by 20%.  Since that time, the price of a barrel of oil has decreased from $147 to $45.  Why have we seen no corresponding reduction in energy costs?  We accept that those costs are related to the price at which oil is purchased on the international market at a given time, but when that price drops to such an extent, that reduction should be reflected in the price of electricity, home heating oil and gas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">The Commission for Energy Regulation recently organised an energy forum.  This public initiative was welcome, but no consumer representative was included.  Consumers are taking all the hits without being given any voice.  The National Consumer Agency has urged people to shop around and to shun retailers who charge large mark-ups.  The chief executive officer of the agency, Ms Ann Fitzgerald, has acknowledged that costs are higher in this State but the question that must be answered is exactly how much higher they are.  I very much look forward to the report referred to by both the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, which will outline the costs to retailers and others trying to do business in this jurisdiction.  If the report is as positive as the Minister suggests, it should help to ensure better value for consumers by contributing to the ending of rip-off Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">There are other areas in which the Government can have a significant influence in terms of charges to consumers.  In the health service area, for example, we have seen an increase in medical centre charges, accident and emergency charges and the cost of private and semi-private beds in public hospitals.  Added to these are the failure of the Government to keep the cost of medicines down, as well as the recent imposition of the levy on health insurance.  All these increases are adding to the cost of living for consumers.  On top of the added tax burden on the average family of €2,450 arising from the budget, these increased charges do not spell good news for consumers.  Rather than calling for patriotic action from citizens, what is required is an effort by the Government to reduce costs to both businesses and consumers.</p>

          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_1365">I took the 7.38 a.m. train from Coolmine Station this morning.  I try to use public transport as often as possible but sometimes the will does not meet the expectation.  It is the first time I have travelled on this particular train for some six weeks and I immediately noticed that there was plenty of space in the carriage.  My first thought was that additional carriages had been provided, but I discovered on disembarking at Connolly Station that this was not the case.  Although I am aware of all the statistics, it was then that I was struck by the extent to which the recession is being reflected on train services and main streets.  For the first time in four years, there are seats on the train in the morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">After a breakfast meeting, I went to a jeweller's shop to get my watch repaired.  I walked back through Powerscourt, down the lane with all the jewellery shops, along Grafton Street and on to Dawson Street.  I counted 14 signs on this journey indicating premises for sale or to let.  This is a remarkable sight in central Dublin and gives an indication of how far the situation has deteriorated in just two or three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">This is why I find the Government's counter-motion so strange.  It is Alice in Wonderland territory, particularly in respect of the commendation of the Government on its prudent management of the economy.  Whatever the Government has been, it has certainly not been prudent.  Not even its supporters would make that claim.  A borrowing requirement of 8% or 9% of GDP next year does not arise as a result of prudent governance.  Many economies are experiencing recession but none within the European Union or the OECD will have a borrowing requirement as large.  Prudence does not lead to a deficit of that magnitude.  It is worrying that the Government considers itself to have been prudent in its management of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">The Government motion also notes its commitment to tackling inflation in areas over which it has direct influence.  Leaving the regulators aside, where the Government has indirect influence, the areas in which it has direct influence include health charges, which are increasing by 52% this year, somewhere between 50 times inflation and infinity times inflation.  As I said yesterday, CIE fares have increased by 5% and Luas fares by 4%.  The charge for processing naturalisation applications by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has doubled.  Every Government charge has increased by at least ten times the rate of inflation.  It is wonderland stuff for the Government to state that the charges over which it has direct influence are not increasing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">The Government also congratulates itself on its continued investment in the national development plan.  Admittedly, our allocation for capital investment is substantially greater than that of other countries.  However, the reality is that funding for the national development plan will be reduced by 10%, or €1 billion, in 2009.</p>

          <p eId="para_1371">The Government welcomes the recent decision of the Commission for Energy Regulation not to increase the price of gas and electricity.  The reason for recent significant increases in those prices was the rise in commodity prices.  That upward trend is now turned on its head, with commodity prices falling back to where they were 18 months ago.  Yet the Government celebrates the fact that there has not been another increase in prices.  It seems that when commodity prices rise there is a corresponding increase in utility prices but, when they fall, the Government merely congratulates itself that there is no further increase.  Surely there should be an increase when commodity prices rise and a decrease when they fall.  That seems logical but it is clearly not the view of the Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_1373">The Government's counter-motion includes a reference to reducing the burden of regulation on business.  I acknowledge that the Government is making some effort in this regard but, at the same time, it is taking other actions to increase it.  We are given a mythical target of 25%, but this cannot be achieved if one does not know what is the baseline.  Given that there has been no analysis of the baseline cost of regulation, how does the Government expect to quantify a reduction of 25% when it cannot quantify 100%?  That is akin to proposing to reduce one's weight by 25% without ever weighing oneself and to extrapolate that one has lost weight simply because one has eaten fewer buns.  That is how the Government is working out its targets in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, for responding to the contents of the motion in his reply.  The Tánaiste's reply, on the other hand, was merely the single transferable speech on enterprise, trade and employment.  I understand the Forfás study to which the Minister of State referred indicates that the cost of doing business in the Republic is between 5% and 7.5% higher than it is in the North.  I look forward to reading that report because the accuracy of this statistic seems highly doubtful and contrary to common sense.  Taking into account higher labour costs, employer's PSRI, rates, utility costs and so on, one can only conclude that the differential must be far higher, probably close to 20%.  The higher VAT rate is an additional factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">The Minister of State referred to the report of the consumer strategy group.  Two years after that report was delivered, only nine of its 27 recommendations have been implemented.  The Minister of State also referred to the reports of the Competition Authority.  I welcome the undertaking that there will be a response from the Government to future reports of the authority.  However, why has there been no response to the reports already published?  Is it necessary for the authority to publish another report on opticians' or dentists' charges before there can be a Government response?</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">There is no doubt that inflation is decreasing.  However, incomes are stagnant and take home pay is decreasing because of tax increases.  Most people will take home less money in six months' time than they do now.  For that reason, value for money and consumer issues are even more important than they were in the past.  That is why it is important that falling inflation, or potentially even deflation, should not be an excuse to get away with increases in VAT, Government charges and prices levied by utilities.  We should use the opportunity of the recession to make our economy more competitive by bringing those costs down.  That is the reason Fine Gael tabled this motion.  By reducing VAT, insisting the regulatory system is reformed so there is a fair way of setting costs and by reducing and freezing the cost of business we can become competitive again.  That is the approach we will need if the economy is to grow again when the recession ends in 2010 or 2011.  On that basis, I commend the motion to the House.</p>

We are constantly challenged when we call for better health services and wider entitlement and the question posed is, "Who will pay for this?"  The question should be, "Who has paid for this?"  The answer is clearly that the pensioners of Ireland paid for a decent health service in taxes during their working lives.</p>

This saving alone is in excess of what is sought by the Government in terms of the saving signalled in respect of medical cards.  While other options were available, the Government failed to capitalise on other opportunities and instead, I regret, chose to target older citizens and people who have invested a lifetime in helping to build this economy.  I urge all Deputies to reject this so-called Health Bill and ensure access for all citizens over 70 years to the medical card, as a forerunner to the roll-out of full and universal access to free health care for all citizens, paid for by fair and equitable tax contributions.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryWallace" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_581">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Mary Wallace)</from>
          <p eId="para_1531">I wish to share time with Deputy Blaney.</p>
          <p eId="para_1532">The legislation before us introduces new arrangements for medical cards for those aged over 70, the net result of which will be that the vast majority of people aged 70 and over will continue to have medical cards under the new income threshold.  There are three distinct routes for qualifying for the medical card.  First, 95% of people aged 70 and over will qualify on the basis of income.  Second, discretionary medical arrangements are in place in cases where a person's health circumstances cause undue hardship.  Many people who have terminal illnesses, for example, are granted medical cards, although they do not qualify under the means test.  Third, the standard net income means test which applies to people under 70 years takes into account personal circumstances such as high outgoings on nursing home fees.  For those now aged 70 or over, or who will be by the end of the month, there will be no new means test.  Those who turn 70 in the new year will have a simplified means test.</p>
          <p eId="para_1533">The Bill before us enables the ending of the special high capitation fees for GPs paid since 2001 in respect of over 70s who received a medical card by virtue of age rather than means, which is the "gold card".  I welcome the recommendation of Mr. Eddie Sullivan for a single fee capitation level of €290 which we intend to implement from 1 January.</p>
          <p eId="para_1534">I also welcome the<b> </b>announcement by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, that the new arrangements ensure a person aged 70 or older would not lose their medical card as an immediate consequence of the death of their spouse.  All possible solutions to this were explored in recent weeks within the boundaries of what is possible from a non-discrimination point of view between widowed and single persons.  I welcome the Minister’s introduction of an amendment on Committee Stage to give effect to this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1535">The Minister also outlined that a person who had automatic entitlement to a medical card, and therefore full eligibility, would continue to have full eligibility until 2 March 2009.  Consequently, all persons in this category can continue to use their medical card as normal until that date even if their gross income exceeds the relevant income limits set out in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1536">The Government wants to ensure a process of self-assessment for persons covered under these arrangements will be greatly simplified compared to the means assessment process required under the existing hardship-based scheme.  The HSE has been asked to ensure that any assistance needed by a person currently over 70 on self-assessment will be made available by it on an administrative basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1537">A greatly simplified means test will be put in place for persons who will attain the age of 70 on or after 1 January 2009 to enable them to apply under the new arrangements.  The HSE will provide confirmation they meet the qualifying criteria for full eligibility under these arrangements.  They will continue to have full eligibility as long as their gross income does not exceed the relevant limit.  The Bill also provides for the dependents of those over 70.</p>
          <p eId="para_1538">The Bill includes a provision to amend the Health Contributions Act 1979 to provide an exemption from the health contribution for any person who is 70 or reaches the age of 70 on or after 1 January 2009.  The amendment will exempt everyone over 70 from paying the contribution regardless of whether they fall into the existing categories exempted under section 11 of the 1979 Act.  For those now aged over 70, or who will become so by the end of this month, there will be no new means test.</p>
          <p eId="para_1539">The objective of the general medical services scheme is to ensure the medical card benefit is available for those who are unable, without undue hardship, to meet the cost of health services for themselves or their dependents.  Recently I met a 40 year old lady with cancer who was concerned that despite her medical condition and her husband's income being the minimum wage, she did not qualify for a medical card.  She queued in a chemist behind two people, whom she described as very wealthy, who were aged over 70 and had medical cards.  Speakers tonight may not be in the chemists or at the doctor beside the Tony O'Reilly's of this world, but she was incensed that wealthy people had a medical card while she had to pay for her medication despite her cancer diagnosis.  We want to try and protect people like this with medical cards.  People with a genuine medical need should receive a card whether they are over or under the age of 70.  Those over 70 who do not qualify under the current arrangements can apply for a discretionary medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540">As we look to future changes in demographics, it can be seen that Ireland has the youngest population in Europe, with approximately 11% of the population aged 65 or over.  It is estimated this figure will rise to 20% by 2036 and 29% by 2056.  In the years ahead our nation's age profile will change.  The number of people in the population aged 70 is approximately 350,000 but this is projected to increase to 535,000 by 2021.  We need to plan for this and provide many health services for those aged 55 and over who will form the over 70 group at that time, and use public resources in the most effective and fairest way possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1541">The Minister, in her speech, outlined the new arrangements which will form part of the Bill to ensure the vast majority of people aged 70 and over will continue to hold a medical card.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NiallBlaneyIND" eId="spk_582">
          <from>Deputy Niall Blaney</from>
          <p eId="para_1542">I thank Deputy Wallace for sharing time.  The content of this Bill has been the subject of much debate over recent weeks and I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on it.  The decision taken by the Government to end the automatic entitlement to a medical card for all those aged 70 and over was not an easy one.  When the commitment was made to enact the practice of automatic entitlement we faced very different times.  Ireland was in darkness for many years and is experiencing significant changes in its economic environment.  Things were on the way up and the Government was in an enviable position whereby it could provide such measures.  However, things have changed and we are now in a global economic crisis which has resulted in a situation where expenditure has had to be cut across most Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1543">Cuts are never easy to endure, contrary to what the Opposition would have one believe.  Decisions on where cuts may be implemented are difficult.  I realise the Minister and Ministers of State in the Department of Health and Children faced tough decisions when balancing its books.  The Minister has presided over a radical overhaul of the health service which is ongoing.  The overhaul was necessary and courageous.  We have all heard the negative issues which have plagued our health service over the years.  The overhaul was and is necessary to ensure we can provide a world-class health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1544">Unfortunately the issue of automatic entitlement to a medical card for those aged 70 and over had to be reviewed to make necessary savings to continue to provide other critical services in the health sector.  It is vital to point out the criteria which will take effect with this Bill.  The vast majority of those aged 70 and over will continue to have medical cards under the new income thresholds.  The income threshold has been set at €700 per week for a single person and €1,400 per week for a couple.  This is a sizeable income per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1545">Furthermore, should an individual find themselves to be above the income thresholds outlined there is a process whereby they can apply for a medical card subject to personal circumstances causing undue hardship.  There has been anxiety amongst older people which we have all experienced in our constituencies.  There has been a great deal of scaremongering, which is not helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1546">Those aged 70 and over who currently hold a medical card will have their entitlement fulfilled under the new arrangements.  They will not be subjected to any means test and will continue to hold their medical card.  Those who will turn 70 before the end of this month are also automatically entitled to a medical card.  Those who turn 70 after the end of this month will be subject to a simplified means test whereby their gross income will be examined to establish if it is below the new income threshold.</p>
          <p eId="para_1547">We would prefer to be in a position to offer automatic entitlement to medical cards to all those over 70 years of age, but it is not possible in the current economic climate.  We have reorganised the scheme to ensure the elderly most in need are protected in terms of medical card entitlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1548">It is fair that those who are financially secure and in a position to pay for their health care should be asked to do so at this time.  This debate also raised the issue of capitation fees for GPs, which have been paid since 2001 for those over 70 in receipt of medical cards due to age rather than means.  These fees have been financially unsustainable and I commend Mr. Eddie Sullivan's efforts in securing an agreement where a single fee capitation level will be paid to GPs in respect of medical card holders over 70 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1549">Irish people are living longer and healthier lives.  I read yesterday that Irish children were ranked first out of 41 countries for physical activity and general health in a WHO survey.  We enjoy very high standards of living in this country, which is something that does not receive enough attention.  However, much of that is due to the standards in our health services.  We have a young population in Ireland, but this is expected to change in the future, as our population ages and people are expected to live longer than in the past.  We must plan for this and it is within these terms that the medical card scheme has been adjusted.  It is vital that the scheme continues to be sustainable in the years that lie ahead.  Therefore, I believe that this Bill provides a fair and equitable method of medical card provision for the ageing members of our society.  They deserve to be looked after, and they deserve fair access to health services.  That is why the issue had to be addressed at this time.  Those most in need are those we are endeavouring to cater for most in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1550">The health service has been a hot topic in the past number of years, but that is what is to be expected when an overhaul is in progress.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, has overseen the biggest overhaul in the service in recent years, and I commend her and Professor Drumm on their efforts.</p>

        <speech by="#NiallBlaneyIND" eId="spk_584">
          <from>Deputy Niall Blaney</from>
          <p eId="para_1552">The Deputy will have his chance in a minute, so I will have my say now.  There has been much criticism, which has not been constructive, of her efforts, even though she has taken criticism on board when necessary.  Nonetheless, she has continued to pursue the changes required in order to ensure that our nation will enjoy a first class health service in the future.  There have been shortcomings in the past, but we are endeavouring to ensure that those shortcomings are eliminated step by step.</p>
          <p eId="para_1553">The decision to develop centres of excellence has been a contentious matter, but I fully support it.  If I was unwell, I would much prefer to go to one of these centres of excellence where I would receive top class treatment, rather than attend a local facility where the appropriate expertise may not be available.  Politicians come under pressure to retain all services at our local hospitals, but this is not always the best option.  In time, the people of this country will realise that the road the Minister is taking is the right one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1554">Having said that, it is fitting to recognise the importance of the services provided by local hospitals all around the country.  My local hospital in Letterkenny continues to provide an excellent service to the people of Donegal, despite the focus in recent years on services that do not exist at the hospital.  I commend the general manager at the hospital, Mr. Seán Murphy, and his staff, on continuing to put the patient first in these difficult times.  I was relieved to learn recently that the colposcopy services at the hospital are to be retained and upgraded, with a view to being included as one of the centres of excellence by the National Cancer Screening Service, headed by Mr. Tony O'Brien.</p>
          <p eId="para_1555">We are also pleased that the breast care unit at Letterkenny General Hospital will be officially opened by the Tánaiste later this month.  This is very welcome progress.  A new accident and emergency unit has been sanctioned by the Department and will include an additional 70 beds.  A new mental health unit is also in the pipeline for the hospital, so it must be said that there is good news for the health service in these hard times.  It is important that these good news stories are highlighted, because it is easy to be negative, but it is also futile at times.  We all recognise that there is not as much money in the Exchequer as we would like, so the onus is on all of us to ensure that there is value for money in everything we do.  Less money does not have to mean less effective services, but it puts emphasis on those who are most in need, which is what this Bill is all about.  It is about putting the focus on those most in need and dealing with the resources that are available to us.  I commend the Minister, the Ministers of State at the Department and the rest of the Cabinet on their constant efforts in ensuring that people are put at the centre of health services and for dealing with those most in need before dealing with anybody else.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1556">I wish to share time with Deputy Seymour Crawford.</p>
          <p eId="para_1557">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I do not understand from where this came.  A brave decision was made to recognise those over 70 who contributed to the development of this State, to the development of the services we have and to the development of the standard of living to which Deputy Blaney refers, by giving them a medical card which they prized very much.  It was very important to them.  Yet, in the recent budget, the Government decided to take it away.  Government members saw the reaction of elderly people, even though they thought those people were a soft touch.  However, they were not a soft touch.</p>
          <p eId="para_1558">People who retire are labelled, although they have vast experience of life.  They come from all professions and all levels of society.  They are doctors, architects, managers, factory workers, carpenters, builders, educators and trainers, yet they are just labelled as retired.  The Government decided to attack the service given to them, one that is very important to elderly people.  As people get older, they experience disproportionate levels of health problems compared to the general population.  Therefore, the medical card is very important to them.  The Government witnessed the emotive reaction of people who saw that something they cherished very much was being taken away from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1559">Another group that was forgotten included those who expected to obtain a medical card on reaching 70 years of age.  These people will no longer receive the card and I do not understand how a decision like that could be made from a human point of view.  I do not understand how the Government decided to do this from a political point of view either.  Anybody with any knowledge of politics would know that to attack a vulnerable group would be extremely sensitive and that there would be a reaction.  The Government thought these people were insignificant.  It felt it was taking the easy option by withdrawing services from the elderly, as opposed to trying to achieve savings in the capitation rate for GPs, but that has been flushed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560">Since the Government unilaterally announced the withdrawal of the automatic entitlement to a medical card for those over 70, there has been confusion about the criteria used to determine those who will retain their medical card and those who will not retain it.  We are told that most people will retain it, but we just do not know how many people will do so.  The Government did not know how many people would be entitled to the medical card when it was introduced in the first place.  Now there is absolute confusion about how many people will retain the medical card.  It is clear that the Government put no thought into the withdrawal of the medical card.  It made it up as it went along.  The unprecedented show of public outrage, to which I have already referred, forced the Government into a climbdown from the budget day decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1561">Under the terms of the Bill we are discussing, the gross weekly income threshold for medical cards for people over the age of 70 is €700 per week for a single person and €1,400 for a couple.  From next January, people who turn 70 but do not have a medical card at present will have to undergo what the Department of Health and Children describes as a "simplified means test" to establish whether their income exceeds the €700 limit.  I would love to know how "simplified means test" is defined.  Anybody over the age of 70 who has a net income of more than €595 in the case of a single person, or €1,135 in the case of a couple, will not be entitled to a medical card.  These figures, which do not include PRSI, show that contrary to the Minister for Finance's suggestion, people who are not millionaires will lose their medical cards.  Many ordinary people who have an income above these limits, including retired public servants such as teachers, gardaí and nurses, will lose their medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1562">I would like to give an example of the manner in which the people to whom I have referred, who have served their country well, will be affected by these changes.  I will highlight the position of retired teachers in this regard.  The revised means test figures, to which I have referred, will make most retired teachers ineligible for the medical card on the basis of a relatively small level of income.  While the limits seem generous on the face of it, they are not favourable to most retired teachers.  All income will be calculated as gross income for the purposes of this scheme, as I have said.  The pension a teacher receives after 40 years of service is now almost €32,000.  If he or she enjoys a slightly higher pension on foot of a modest promotion or qualification allowance, he or she will exceed the limit by a small amount.  This will also be the case in households with two pensions — if two retired teachers are married to each other, or a retired teacher is married to a person who is in receipt of a different occupational pension.  Like all Members of the House, the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, will accept that the teaching profession has contributed as much as any other sector, and more than most of them, to the development of Irish society.  The standard of living of people in this country has increased as they have availed of the opportunity to participate in the educational system.  Our primary, secondary and third level teachers have facilitated such change.  This decision will hit the teaching profession hard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1563">All gross payments for substitute, resource or temporary teaching work undertaken by a retired teacher will, of course, be added to his or her pension for the purposes of calculating his or her income.  It will probably cause the gross income of a teacher to exceed the means test limit.  Other forms of income, such as savings in excess of a certain amount, interest and dividends from banks or credit unions, are also taken into consideration in the means test.  The Government's proposals will have a strong impact on one of the benefits retired people enjoy.  There is confusion about the total saving that will accrue from this measure.  The Government does not know the exact figure.  I would welcome it if the Minister, in her response at the end of this debate, could outline the extent of the savings that will be made as a result of the cruel and unacceptable decision to take medical cards from people over the age of 70.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_586">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1564">While I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, I do not agree with its contents.  When it suited Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to encourage people over the age of 70 to vote for them in the 2002 general election, they offered free medical cards to all such people without a means test.  We were advised that the measure would cost approximately €17 million per annum.  Like many other proposals, such as decentralisation, this proposal was implemented without any preliminary discussions or negotiations with the doctors or other relevant personnel.  Of course, the final cost of the scheme was closer to €57 million than to €17 million.  The organised propaganda of Fianna Fáil involves blaming the doctor who represented the doctor's organisation at the time for the cost of the scheme.  The doctor in question, Deputy James Reilly, is now the Fine Gael spokesperson on health.  His job was to get the best deal he could for his members.  It is somewhat far-fetched to try to transfer to the Deputy the blame for the Government's mismanagement and incompetence in this case.  However, it is typical of this Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1565">The best way of reversing the outrageous decision to remove the automatic medical card entitlement from those who have given such service to this country is to ensure the moneys in question are saved in other areas.  I suggest we cut some of the substantial waste in the administration of the health service.  I will give an example of such waste.  Some time ago, the HSE invited me to attend a meeting to discuss an issue of relevance to the head of that body.  Approximately 95% of my questions were answered at the meeting, which lasted an hour and at which nine HSE managers were present.  I was the first of the Members of the Oireachtas who represent the Cavan-Monaghan constituency to be dealt with on the day in question.  My colleagues were dealt with in a similar way after I was finished.  There was no need for nine managers to be absent from their desks for a whole day.  They could have met the Members of the Oireachtas from the constituency in a single group and dealt with the issue within two hours.  This is one of many examples of cases which exemplify the need to examine HSE structures.  Professor Drumm has admitted he does not understand what some people in the HSE administrative system do.  I accept that there are some brilliant and hardworking administrative staff in the system.  However, I do not doubt that the money needed to pay for the automatic provision of medical cards to everyone over the age of 70 could have been found if the Minister and Professor Drumm wanted to find it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1566">The Government has done something of a U-turn by providing for more realistic income levels to be applied to the medical card means test.  It is sad that the provision of a cervical cancer vaccine to 12 year olds was deferred to facilitate this change.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, and the HSE need to examine the manner in which significant sums of taxpayers' money are spent in the health system.  All services were available at Monaghan General Hospital when it was run by Monaghan County Council.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, has never found the time to visit the hospital.  Her only interest, and that of Professor Drumm, is to close the hospital as quickly as possible in spite of the fact that €17 million has been spent on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1567">I learned today of a patient with a broken arm who entered Cavan General Hospital on Monday and was transferred to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, on Tuesday.  Along with 27 other orthopaedic patients, she slept on a trolley at the latter hospital.  Her arm was reset and generally dealt with while she was under local anaesthetic because it was not possible to get her a full-time bed, with full anaesthetic services, for a number of weeks.  The level of suffering she and a number of others endured, as a consequence of the fact that only local anaesthetic services were available, is unacceptable in any caring health service.  This incident happened at a time when the orthopaedic unit at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, has been closed as a result of the mismanagement of our health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1568">I have been ordered by the HSE to attend a meeting regarding the reconfiguration of the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group, with particular reference to the transfer of the acute medical unit at Monaghan to Cavan.  It is relevant that this meeting has been organised at St. Davnet's psychiatric hospital complex, as only those with psychiatric problems would consider what the HSE is doing with full ministerial and governmental support.  At present Cavan General Hospital cannot cope with its own patient intake and the hospital in Drogheda had to be taken off call a few weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1569">Clearly the Minister with the support of her Fianna Fáil colleagues is prepared to treat the people of Monaghan as guinea pigs for a new system that is completely untried and unworkable and will cost lives.  This is the advice I have received from highly qualified people not directly working in Monaghan who originally supported the HSE management but now realise it has no idea how to manage its funds or how to run a safe system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1570">The budget proposal on medical cards caused serious stress and pain to all those over 70 and all those who care for them.  As pointed out by Deputy Neville, regardless of the changes made there is still a tremendous fear amongst couples who realise that when one of them passes away the other member will be subject to a much tighter means test and may lose the medical card.  At that age the death of a spouse is enough to deal with without having to go through the trauma of a means test and the possible loss of a medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_1571">Clearly better negotiations between the HSE, the doctors and all concerned could have avoided this entire trauma.  However, as one representing the counties of Cavan and Monaghan I cannot ignore the difficulties within the means-test system for all other medical card applicants.  It is totally unacceptable that a county such as Monaghan has only approximately 32% of its population availing of medical cards while Donegal, for instance, has 52%.  Other areas such as Cork where incomes are higher than Monaghan have a much higher percentage of medical cards available.  While the medical card is extremely important for those in frequent need of doctors' calls and medication, never mind hospital, it is equally of major importance for families living in rural areas who will get a free bus pass, clothing allowance and book allowance it they have a medical card but without which they get none.</p>
          <p eId="para_1572">There is also a problem for people who are terminally ill.  I understand there are question marks over whether these people will get the medical card in future which is extremely serious.  For years I have battled in Cavan and Monaghan to try to minimise the trauma those people suffer.  They still need to go through a full means test.  I remember one case in which a self-employed person with cancer had lost part of his tongue.  The HSE insisted that he prepare his accounts for the previous year before deciding whether he would get a medical card.  This is the ridiculous gone mad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1573">At the start of her speech, the Minister for Health and Children emphasised that 95% of people will get the medical card in future following this great dramatic change.  One wonders what this is all about.  How many of those who were eligible for medical cards actually applied for them?  Would some of those super rich people that the Minister and the Taoiseach mentioned have bothered to apply for medical cards?  If so how much use did they make of them?  Did it cost the State a fortune?  Those people would have had private medical insurance.  How great will the saving be so that we can judge whether this is a good deal?</p>
          <p eId="para_1574">Clearly no thought was put into this proposal before it was put on the table.  The means test was originally pitched at a level below ordinary social welfare levels.  Obviously with the scare of the thousands of people at the gates of Leinster House new thinking needed to be put in and the Government has made a change.  Is there any justification for this proposal?</p>
          <p eId="para_1575">As I have already stated there are major problems in the structure of the HSE.  There are major problems in the wider health service with mismanagement etc.  I recently heard people talking about what had happened in the other part of this island, the Six Counties, since it got its own Minister.  That Minister has sat down and talked to the people.  He has asked that they do a little extra each.  He has got co-operation from them.  Although he did not ask for an increase in budget, he has improved services.  Our Minister and the Government could learn from that.  A little more involvement with the people who work in the services could do a lot.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
          <p eId="para_1576">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Like everybody I fully realise the importance of the issue before us.  I am also aware of the background and the response some weeks ago to the budget proposal on the withdrawal of the universal scheme.  I would like to make a few points about issues that have come up not just during this debate but in recent weeks.  As we are all aware the issue was part of a Government budgetary structure by way of responding to the serious financial issues that face the Government on the economic front.</p>
          <p eId="para_1577">I wish to clarify that this was a Government decision.  For some time members of the public and some Members of the Opposition tried to tie it down to a single decision made by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The decision taken to withdraw the universal scheme was a collective Cabinet decision supported by the parties in Government.  It is important to make that point.  Much discussion in this debate has centred on wondering how people in Government could make such a mistake as to withdraw medical card cover.  In response to that it is fair to point out that normally people on this side of the House are accused of being too cute, as it were, when it comes to dealing with the public.  We have often suffered that accusation.  I respond by saying that the issue would never have come before us were it not for the times we are in.</p>
          <p eId="para_1578">A few minutes ago a Deputy mentioned that the greatest sin was that when medical cards were given to all the over 70s in 2002 it created an expectation of medical card cover for life.  Access to free medical cards for the over 70s was granted along with many other fringe benefits quite properly and deservedly awarded over the years, including the free travel and other free schemes.  Again I emphasise that they are people's entitlements.  I find it difficult to square up the fact that people and Members of the House have a difficulty with the Government withdrawing the universality of the scheme and yet in 2002 we had little support.  We certainly did not have universal support for the introduction of the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_1583">No, absolutely.  I make the point that in 2002 it was a very brave decision by a Government that was clearly in different economic times.  It was not an election or political stunt.  It was an attempt to continue the support of the elderly over the years.  I will not go into all the figures that were before the Dáil this evening in respect of income levels and limits and the means test nor will I go into the funding set aside over the past five years for the care and support of the elderly.  There was the entire issue of increased subvention for the elderly in nursing homes and, more important, the recent reform bill by way of the subvention.  The suggestion that the Government turned its back consistently on the elderly does not stand up to scrutiny.  The very fact that these schemes and those supports——-</p>

I stress again that any party in Government is not in the business of creating unpopularity for itself.  That is a given.  The reasons for this decision must be examined.  It is important to point out to the House that 1.4 million people in this State are entitled to medical card cover.  Of that 1.4 million, 355,000 are over 70 years of age.

I will make a further point, and it is not by way of trying to waffle away from the issue that Deputies have put before me, if they say that the budget strategy and the announcement on budget day were somewhat different, it would be difficult to explain the situation in the three minutes available.

          <p eId="para_1595">I do not say that.  The budget was not rushed.  There were deliberations for weeks on the budget.  I do not even use that as an excuse, far from it.  I make the point that on the day of the budget announcement of the medical card issue the belief was created that all cover for people over 70 years of age was to be withdrawn.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  As I pointed out, the measure did not affect approximately 230,000 of the 355,000 concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1596">There is no point in changing one's tack because the crowd says different.  I still support the Government decision.  I believe it was an attempt to achieve more.  I do not hold with using the names of so-called wealthy people.  Such names were well quoted recently but I will say that a certain 20,000 or 25,000 people do not need cover.  The strategy was to withdraw cover from people in that category and try to spread what might be saved.  The figure was €100 million.  Before Deputy Crawford left, he asked if I could confirm where that saving could be secured.  It might have been secured by way of the renegotiation of the capitation charges.  I insisted at the time that I had no difficulty in that regard in the negotiation with the IMO and the Department.

          <p eId="para_1599">That would have provided the savings.  The policy in that regard was to ensure that by taking from those who did not need that cover, savings of €100 million would be spread around new services within the Department of Health and Children.  It is worth noting that the overall reduction to the health Estimate was a figure of approximately €800 million.  On the other hand, new services in the region of €700 million were provided for health in this budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1600">Without trying to squeeze the last cent, somebody must look at the process and examine the considerable demands for new health services.  Now that the cancer strategy is in place under Professor Keane, it is time to move on to provide expert cancer services for other types of cancers.  Professor Keane made that point himself.  That again requires new money and a figure of €15 million was put towards that.  The commitment has been such that whatever funding was required to support the national cancer strategy it would be secured each year by an increase in the budget strategy for the Department of Health and Children.  We tried to get an amount from the medical card scheme for those aged over 70 by reducing the numbers eligible.  The savings were to be specifically diverted to progress new strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1601">It is fair to point out that there are many other areas in health for which there were considerable demands in this budget.  We discussed the new children's hospital for which funding must be secured to provide that very much needed service.  Naturally, all the public attention and that of non-Government parties in the House focused on the medical card issue.  There are other issues on which people did not focus, for instance the need to fund a Vision for Change.</p>

In that regard I must support the strategy.  I still do.</p>

          <p eId="para_1611">In the argument about care for those aged over 70, people were convinced that not only would they lose their medical cards but, as I heard myself in the church down town, that unless they stood to fight on the medical card removal issue they would also lose their free travel and other benefits.  That was never in the debate at all.  I hope at this point that advocates for those aged over 70 might see that a certain strategy was behind the entire process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1612">Certain questions came up in the last hour of the debate.  I believe I have covered the issue of where the funding will go and what can be secured.  I make the point again that the figure in question was €100 million. Deputy Neville mentioned how the issue affects an elderly couple in the event of one party dying.  I take his point.  There is then a reduced income which remains above the means test for a single person.  I understand that issue and I know that a great difference is created in health demands for the now single person.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, acknowledged this.  She is prepared to look at the matter as the Bill goes through, recognising that the change of status from married couple to single individual would create certain difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1613">I take the point the Deputy made about retired teachers.  It is a much larger issue than that and affects all retired people.  I suggest that by taking the comments of Members today, the Minister indicated it is an area she intends to revisit.  On the reaction to the public demonstration, if the budget as announced on the day had contained more explanation of the specific details of the scheme and made people fully aware they were not losing their entitlements, the demonstrations we met — and quite properly so — would not have been as tense.</p>

          <p eId="para_1615">I am not saying that.  I am making the point — and I have suggested this to my parliamentary party — that the necessity for the Minister for Finance to come into the House and discuss so many major issues within an hour and a half is something we should all think about.  Years ago, as I know from running a pub, the big fear at the time of the budget was that the local publican would go out and stock up in advance of budget day to make sure he had enough beer, fags and spirits in the house for the period between the budget and later on.  The issues are now so huge that in the run-up to the budget it would be fair for the House to discuss the different aspects of a possible budget strategy to obtain Members' feelings on various matters.  Nowadays it is not about how much stock one has in at 12 o'clock on the night before the budget announcement; it is far more important for us all to realise that we are dealing with a slowdown in the economy and, more importantly, trying to support a massive health expenditure of something like €16 billion.  The difference between this recession and the previous one is that funding in health has increased.  The last time out, it was a decrease.</p>

          <p eId="para_1620">I am just referring to the issues that were raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621">It was asked what would be the outcome of this measure for people with properties.  To reiterate what the Minister, Deputy Harney, has already stated, this Bill gives effect to the Government's commitment not to impute income from property.  For the purpose of assessing gross income under this Bill, income will not be imputed from any property, whether it is a family home, a holiday home or any other property, unless it is rented, and only the net rental income, calculated as gross income less any costs necessarily associated with renting the property will be included for this purpose.  I do not want to use the word "concession", but there is a realisation that property owned by the elderly will not be taken into account in the means test.  I have also been advised that people who are 70 years of age before 1 January and hold a medical card on the basis of automatic eligibility under section 45A of the Act, prior to the enactment of this Bill, shall notify the HSE no later than 2 March 2009 if they have concluded their incomes exceed the gross limits.  It is important we acknowledge that the Government wants to ensure the process of self-assessment for persons covered under these arrangements will be much simplified compared to the means assessment process required under the existing hardship-based scheme.  Consequently, the HSE has been asked to ensure that any assistance with self-assessment required by a person who is currently over 70 be made available on an administrative basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1622">Everybody who has been involved in politics, local or national, over the years — somebody earlier mentioned our time on the health boards — will be aware that often, if somebody was over the income limit but was able to provide medical evidence of certain hardships, he or she would be provided with a medical card.  This is not a smokescreen or a cop-out.  While some may ask how many of the 20,000 we claim are above the income limit never obtained a medical card, we can also point, on the other end of the scale, to the number of people who were over the income limit but were given medical cards because of hardship or health problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1623">The Bill also includes a provision to amend the Health Contributions Act 1979 to provide an exemption from the health contribution for any person who is or reaches the age of 70 on or after 1 January 2009.  The amendment will exempt everybody over 70 from paying the contribution regardless of whether they fall into the existing categories exempted under section 11 of the 1979 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1624">I fully support everything the Minister, Deputy Harney, has done, is doing and will do in her attempt to reform the health service.  I take every opportunity I can to say that.  I also try to avail of every opportunity to say that I have full and total confidence in the HSE.  After our days as health board members when we saw extensive duplication of services, it is a welcome change to have one entity in charge of health.</p>

          <p eId="para_1632">Anybody who fails to recognise the anger of the many elderly people who protested outside the gates of Leinster House and on the streets of Dublin in the recent past misses the whole point of the need for this legislation.  It is unprecedented that a Government would introduce legislation to withdraw a service to the elderly — those over 70 — regardless of the times that are in it.  If the present Government cannot find areas other than the withdrawal of medical cards and associated services in which to make savings of €100 million, we know it must have scant regard for the elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1633">The Minister of State spoke about savings.  Earlier this afternoon I heard the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, in which she diverged from her prepared script and indulged herself by mentioning statements made by other Members of the House — usually this side of the House — ten to 12 years ago on the availability of medical cards.  One wonders whether she considered the waste of time and energy for the officials who had to research that information.  She probably has such a large number of support staff within her Department that she could waste their time to make a political point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1634">What is the actual cost of the implementation of this legislation when one considers drawing up the legislation and the changes that must be implemented as a result?  We learned from the Minister's speech when she introduced this legislation to the House on Second Stage that there are now three sets of conditions and criteria for special categories of the over 70s.  The people who are to implement this on the ground are already confused by statements issuing from on high and from all sorts of places when they are assessing people, legitimately, for medical cards.  The Minister of State said he remembered the discretion allowed by health boards.  We all remember that.  Where is the discretion today when cancer patients in this country are being refused access to the services provided by a medical card, regardless of their age?  If that is not the nail in the coffin for many people I do not know what is.  Now the Minister of State is talking about withdrawal of medical cards from the elderly.  Every single Government speaker on Second Stage has stated that 95% of people will retain the medical card.  That statement is inconsistent because the Minister of State has said in his contribution that the majority of people would retain the card.  In a matter of four or five pages, the number has been reduced from 95% of people being more or less guaranteed retention of the medical card to that of a bare majority.  There is not a scintilla of proof available from anybody, including the Minister of State, with regard to how many people will benefit and how many people will lose out.  It is certain that far more than 5% of those currently holding a medical card will lose them.  To cap all that, it is stated in section 4 of the Bill that entitlement may be index-linked.  Surely if the Minister wanted it to be index-linked she would use the phrase, "It will be" index-linked on 1 September each year.  This will not happen as it is only a notion that could or might happen; it is not a guarantee that it will happen.  Many more people will, after a year or two, lose out and will be beyond the income limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1635">The Minister of State referred to the example of where a spouse dies.  If a person is just one single euro over the limit, he or she will lose that facility.  The limit is €700 for a single person and €1,400 for a couple.  I hope somebody in the Department looked at this before the Government included this provision in the budget.  I am certain the majority of people on public service pensions would lose the medical card.   I refer to retired nurses, gardaí and teachers who will probably lose out as a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1636">There are now 350,000 people over 70 years of age and by the year 2020, there will be many more.  We are living longer and we have to plan for this.  Elderly people live longer as a result of better health services but this will become a burden on the State.  If that is the economics behind it rather than the consideration of health needs, then so help any of us if we live beyond that dreaded age of 70.</p>

          <p eId="para_1637">I can see that the spirit of Scrooge is alive and well and like Scrooge, the ghost of Christmas past is coming back to haunt this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1638">I remind the Minister of State of the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in April 2007, just prior to the general election, and of what the then Taoiseach Deputy Bertie Ahern said during his live television address.  He claimed that Fianna Fáil is the party to take care of pensioners.  He said: "They talk; we deliver.  Just ask pensioners all across Ireland."  It seems that today the ghost of Christmas past sits on the back benches.  The Minister of State should ask any pensioners now what they think of this Government and the promises it made.  The Government has abandoned and betrayed the pensioners.  They have very little to cheer about this Christmas.  It is not a season to be jolly for many of our older people because they still remain worried and confused about the medical card situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1639">The decision to end the automatic right to a medical card for the over 70s was taken for purely financial reasons.  This decision was wrong and it should not have happened.  Our older people built this country; they have made their contribution.  In the twilight of their years they should not have to worry about how they will be cared for in their old age.  During the height of this debate they were assured by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, that this decision would mostly impact on retired public servants and High Court judges but this is not the case.  Deputy Neville spoke about retired teachers.  A deputation of retired teachers met me to express grave concern about their future considering the contribution they had made to society.  They believe many of them will lose their medical cards.  Other groups of people affected will include retired nurses, gardaí, former Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta workers in my own constituency and local authority workers will now be excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1640">Statistics show that approximately 215,000 out of the current 350,000 people over the age of 70 have a medical card based on an assessment of means.  The Government is telling us that only 20,000 of the remaining 140,000 people will now be affected under the revised scheme but I am not convinced by that argument.  In my own constituency of Clare there are more than 9,046 pensioners over the age of 70 who were issued with a medical card as at 31 October 2008.  These pensioners and their families in County Clare were put through unnecessary distress by this ill-thought out proposal.  I have met many of them and listened to their concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1641">In the case of a medical card expiring in 2012, what is the situation if the person believes he or she is over the income limit and still continues to use the card?  Many people are confused.  How many of these pensioners will fall into the "excluded" category?  Under pressure from the grey revolution the Minister has agreed to alter the income limits for the fifth time.  However, confusion still reigns.  There is very little information available as to how the entire scheme will operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1642">Another one of the promises of the ghost of Christmas past was to index link all medical cards to increases in the average industrial wage.  This commitment should be written into this legislation instead of leaving it to the discretion of the Minister for Health and Children to seek consent from the Minister for Finance to adjust these income limits in future years.  Under this legislation the responsibility now falls on the old age pensioner to declare his or her income by 2 March 2009.  Many older people still have a fear of filling out forms.  What about older people who have long-term debilitating diseases like Alzheimer's?  What provision is being made for these people and who will bear the burden of responsibility?</p>
          <p eId="para_1643">The proposed means test will be a fiasco.  It is just another botched attempt to try to pull the wool over our eyes.  If the Government is now putting the onus on the pensioner to comply with the regulations, how in the name of God can it do so without first clearly outlining how income and savings will be calculated?  The issues surrounding the qualifying criteria and how a person's property is to be assessed should be clear and transparent.  It should not be an official State secret.</p>
          <p eId="para_1644">In order to squeeze every last penny out of every hard-pressed pensioner, this Bill also proposes that the health expenses relief will now only be granted at the standard rate of 20% as opposed to the rate of 41%.  While the Minister claims that those unfortunate to have a terminal illness, for example, can apply for a discretionary medical card on the basis of their health situation, there is no guarantee that they will receive it.  When the older people who will now be branded in the excluded category go to visit their accident and emergency department, need to stay in hospital or have to pay for their medicine they will face additional costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1645">It is not too late to change this legislation and leave a legacy for our older people of which we can be proud.  It is not too late either for the Fianna Fáil backbenchers who claim that they are sorry for the anxiety caused to our old people to act.  We have listened to many Fianna Fáil backbenchers saying how sorry they were.  I urge them to stand up and be counted when a vote is called tomorrow evening.  I ask them to join the ghost of Christmas yet to come and show compassion for our old people.  Join with us and help restore some festive cheer for the old people at Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1646">The former US President, John F. Kennedy, once said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1647">Today in there are those who would shut the door of hope on our older citizens — who would deny them benefits adequate to eliminate poverty and despair. But there are others who will not let that door be closed — who intend to fight for the right of all men to live out their lives in dignity and in health. That rescue party is on the way — and there are more of us — and we are stronger — and we will prevail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1648">We can prevail and we have the courage.  I ask Government Deputies to join us tomorrow evening in reversing this decision to end the automatic right to a medical card for the over 70s.</p>

            <p eId="para_1650">Heineken's decision to close its former competitor in Cork, the Beamish and Crawford brewery, makes the Competition Authority look incompetent for approving Heineken's takeover of the company.  However, there is a ray of light for the brewery, which is closing with the loss of between 100 and 200 jobs.  Various media outlets have reported that SABMiller, a former partner of Beamish and Crawford, may be interested in buying the brewery from Heineken and continuing production of its brands from the site.  The Government must state whether it has done any groundwork on this possible takeover.  Has the Government contacted the interested parties with a view to saving as many jobs as possible?  The Government must also state what it has done to ensure proper competition in the beer market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">I am particularly concerned at the behaviour of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, on the day the closure was announced.  She failed to show any real concern about the Beamish closure when she was in Cork last Thursday.  Instead, she was more concerned with swanning around other parts of the city and county where new jobs would be announced.  Her goal was to take credit for the new jobs, none of which has yet been created, while avoiding any association with the brewery job losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1652">The Government does not seem to value indigenous industry.  Ministers do not seem interested in doing the hard work to help preserve local companies.  Time and again, they seem more interested in attending photocalls for projects which have still not happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_1653">It may not be too late to act if the Government is innovative and committed.  I am looking forward to hearing the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher's, response tonight.  So too are hundreds of families who are dependent on the actions of the Government.  Cork will be a poorer and a sadder place this Christmas season with the closure of one of its traditional and historical industries.  The loss to Cork city of a little piece of its heart with the closure of a centuries old brewing tradition on the landmark Beamish site is traumatic.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1654">I thank Deputy Allen for raising this matter.  Like him, I am disappointed to hear about the job losses at this particular company.  It is a historic company, being one of the oldest trading in Cork.  Beamish has been synonymous with Cork for many years.  Historians have reported there was a brewing site on South Main Street for over 400 years and Beamish has been on that site for centuries.  Cork people have a strong emotional attachment to the brewery not just regarding the Beamish brand, but also the generations that have worked there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1655">Last Thursday, Heineken Ireland briefed its Beamish and Crawford staff on the conclusions of its integration review process following the recent unconditional approval by the independent Competition Authority regarding the acquisition of Beamish and Crawford.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">Having reviewed the capability and capacity of the Beamish plant, the company decided, for its own reasons, to consolidate production in Heineken Ireland's Leitrim Street brewery in Cork and to close the Beamish and Crawford Brewery next year.  The key considerations the company took into account in reaching its decision included an investment requirement of approximately €15 million to meet international brewing standards, difficulty of expansion at the Beamish site, excess brewing capacity at Heineken Ireland and changing market dynamics, resulting in a declining beer market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">As a result of the integration of the commercial and administrative activities, up to 40 employees from Beamish and Crawford will transfer to Heineken Ireland and it is anticipated that approximately 120 people will be made redundant.  This has been a difficult decision for the company to make since it began operations in Cork in 1983 when it acquired Murphy's Brewery.  The company has already agreed comprehensive severance terms with the trade unions.  It will also provide whatever outplacement support is required, as well as career counselling, job search training and pension advice to all the staff who will lose their jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">In April 2008, Enterprise Ireland met with Heineken Ireland to discuss how the agency might work with the enlarged Heineken operations in Cork to develop their potential.  This was with a view to enhancing its export capabilities and to exploring new investment opportunities.  Further discussions were deferred pending the strategic review of the merger operations in Cork.  Subsequent to the recent decision by Heineken Ireland, discussions took place with the company and a follow-up meeting will take place shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">The State development agencies are adopting a co-ordinated approach in response to these job losses.  IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the county development board will be lending their assistance.  This multi-agency approach is directed at assisting all the employees affected and seeks to enhance the future employment prospects of the workforce.  The agencies will also support any individual who wishes to start his or her own business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">I accept the visit to Cork last week of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment coincided with the Heineken Ireland announcement.  However, her diary was organised for the announcement of 145 jobs in Option Wireless Limited in Kilbarry and up to 350 jobs at the Quinn Insurance call centre in Little Island some weeks before the Heineken Ireland announcement.  It is unfair for the Deputy to suggest the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was trying to camouflage the job losses at Beamish and Crawford.</p>

            <p eId="para_1663">Yes, she was, but at the time the staff were being informed by Heineken Ireland of the discussions with the trade unions and others on the merger.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">It will be a sad day when brewing ceases on that site.  All we can hope is that the agreed severance packages will be adhered to and that FÁS and other training agencies will assist those who have lost their jobs.  In the meantime, we must ensure supports are given to Heineken Ireland so that it will be able to expand and open up new markets to ensure Our Lady's Well brewery will continue to prosper and provide employment.</p>

          <heading>Water and Sewerage Schemes.</heading>
          <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_640">
            <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_1668">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me in raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">The Doolin sewerage scheme was included in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's water services programme 2007 to 2009 and was to start construction in 2008, but work on it has yet to begin.  When I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question in April 2008, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government advised me his Department had provided funding of up to €6.025 million for three schemes, Corofin, Ballyvaughan and Doolin, in August 2007.  In the meantime the Corofin project has commenced construction, which I welcome, and a draft foreshore licence is expected to be issued shortly for Ballyvaughan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">The problems being experienced in providing a sewerage scheme in Doolin are replicated in every village and town in County Clare.  The shortage of funding for such schemes has meant that many projects have been revised as if they were to cut their cloth to measure.  Other instances, such as in Scarrif in east Clare and the experience of the residents of Ballyminogue where an extension of the sewage line to their homes was ruled out, highlight the need for the Minister to explore new and innovative ways of addressing this cost issue to ensure water and sewerage schemes can be extended to rural villages and towns.  While Doolin sits and waits, other schemes in Clare have started construction but the majority are still at various stages of progression from Broadford to Carrigaholt, Labasheeda and Cooraclare to Ennistymon, Liscannor, Miltown Malbay and Spanish Point right down into east Clare at O'Callaghans Mills, O'Briens Bridge and Cratloe.  The delay in resolving the situation in Doolin is impacting negatively on the development of the village and indeed in the neighbouring town of Miltown Malbay.  Projects like roads, footpaths and lighting are all on hold because of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, will respond to this Adjournment matter and I am sure he is familiar with Doolin.  Many people have holidayed there over the years.  It is a coastal village, bordered by Lisdoonvarna and the heartland of north Clare, adjacent to Miltown Malbay and close to the renowned Cliffs of Moher and the Burren.  It is a well known centre of traditional Irish music and a popular tourist destination.  Many musicians have lived or played there including the late, great Micho Russell and his brothers Packie and Gussie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1672">Many of those who have visited Doolin have enjoyed Irish music in the village's three pubs.  Doolin has a top class tourist product available including accommodation ranging from bed and breakfasts, farmhouses, guesthouses, hotels and hostels to camping, caravan sites and self-catering.  Most people living and working in Doolin depend on tourism for a living.  More than 3,000 tourists come to Doolin every year during the summer season and it is an appealing tourist location that urgently needs infrastructure.  In 2008 it is unacceptable that residents and tourists are forced to walk on unlit roads late in the evening.   It is a health and safety issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">Doolin is also home to a dedicated 26 member rescue service.  A group of dedicated individuals, under the captaincy of Mattie Shannon, risk their lives every day for others.  I compliment the service and thank it for the work it has done.  This volunteer group is operating out of a building that is no bigger than an average garden shed.  I hope and pray that a proper facility will be put in place in the new year.  Is it right that they should be forced to battle the poor infrastructure while they go about their life-saving work?</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">Regarding the sewerage scheme, my understanding is that the original proposal was to have an out-fall sewer to the sea.  I understand that Clare County Council is now looking at an alternative and that it is in negotiations with a local landowner to purchase a site to put in an alternative treatment plant.  An environmental impact assessment is currently being carried out and Clare County Council is awaiting this report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">The purchase of this site will facilitate the relevant laying of pipes joining the redesigned scheme.  The Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service will then have to view this proposal and comment on the findings of the report.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that this stage of the process moves as swiftly as possible recognising the ecological issues that must be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">When all the various reports are finalised and the new scheme is re-designed by Clare County Council I urge the Department, and the Minister of State as a neighbouring Oireachtas Member, to speed up the scheme.  We do not want the people of Doolin to go without the scheme for another 12 months.  They desperately need this infrastructure.  The entire area is dependent on the successful completion of this sewerage scheme to complement tourism.  I urge the Minister of State to act as quickly as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael P. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_1677">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who regrets that he cannot be present.  I thank Deputy Breen for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">Doolin is linked with Ballyvaughan and Corofin as part of a grouped sewerage scheme that is funded under my Department's water services investment programme 2007-09.  It is one of some 25 water and sewerage schemes included in the programme for County Clare.  Together these schemes will provide modern water and wastewater services in almost 40 different areas of the county.  The overall value of this package is €236 million and it will make a huge difference to environmental standards and economic development opportunities all over Clare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">The Ballyvaughan, Corofin and Doolin project will provide new wastewater treatment plants for each of the three locations, as well as new and improved sewage collection networks.  It will play a major role in facilitating development and supporting the tourism sector, which is of paramount importance to these communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">The high cost of servicing low density unsewered development has been an issue with a number of sewerage schemes in Clare.  It has been necessary to review and adjust the design of these schemes in order to bring costs down to a level where they could be justified in economic terms.  This was successfully achieved with the Feakle, Scarriff and Quilty scheme where my Department's Exchequer contribution has been agreed and work is well under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">The same issue of affordability also arose with the Ballyvaughan, Corofin and Doolin project.  Following examination of Clare County Council's water services pricing policy and economic review reports for the project, Exchequer funding of up to €6.025 million was approved by my Department under the water services investment programme in August 2007.  The approval of this funding, which is in line with the affordability criteria for all new sewerage schemes, was intended to give Clare County Council a clear financial structure within which it could recast the design of the scheme in a more economically efficient way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">Also in August 2007, approval was given to the council to advance the scheme for Corofin which, unlike the other two locations, does not require a foreshore licence.  Work is now under way on that element of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">I agree with Deputy Breen on the great appeal of Doolin.  Clare County Council is reviewing the proposal in light of the funding available from my Department and issues relating to the foreshore licence.  Further progress is therefore in the council's hands at the moment and is not subject to any submission currently before my Department for consideration.  I assure the Deputy that the Department will deal quickly with any revised proposals received from the council with a view to getting the scheme to construction at an early date.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_642">
            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_1684">This issue is one that virtually every Member experiences in his or her constituency.  I refer to large prefabricated school buildings, by and large, portakabins, inadequate conditions, inadequate provision for children and schools awaiting a permanent site and permanent recognition.  The matter is the bane of the primary school system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1685">The school to which I refer is Glasnevin Educate Together, which was founded in September 2002 under the patronage of Educate Together.  It has a special unit for children with autistic spectrum disorder, which was opened in September 2003 by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  In the six years since it opened, numbers have increased steadily.  There are currently 210 children and there is a waiting list of 219 children, who would gladly come to the school in 2009 but unfortunately that is impossible in the present circumstances.  The school is viable but it is awaiting recognition from the Department of Education and Science.  The result of the refusal to grant permanent status means that the school is deprived of the minor works grant, which is worth €9,163 this year.  I tabled a question on this last month.  The effect of non-recognition is that necessary grants for the maintenance of the school are denied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">The school has a student population representing 25 nationalities, a sizeable number.  It is dealing with major ethnic diversity that requires extra attention, facilities and support.  The building is drafty, inadequate, old, cold and cramped.  It has unsanitary toilet facilities and portakabins.  Even the unit for autism is located in a portakabin.  The schoolyard is tiny and there is very little space for the children to play in, with the result that they must go to the local GAA club's playing fields for physical education.  There is no hall for school events.  The facilities are minimal.  Teachers, staff, pupils and parents are working together in difficult circumstances to provide quality education and are not getting assistance they deserve from the Department of Education and Science.  Last year, there was a glimmer of light on the horizon when the Department sanctioned the acquisition of a three-acre site for the school and requested the OPW to source same.  However, the school was informed recently that, because of cuts in capital expenditure, the Department had postponed the site acquisition and, therefore, it has gone down the tubes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1687">The school is in limbo as it has neither permanent recognition nor permanent accommodation.  It has not received the grants and additional funding to which it should be entitled at this time.  Everybody is working and studying in unsatisfactory, inadequate conditions.  The Minister of State can imagine what it is like with cold, foggy and wet days coming one after the other, while the exact opposite is the case in the summer when it is sticky and unbearably hot.  I call on him to make progress.  I would like the Department to show its intent to address the situation in the short rather than the long term.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1688">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides an opportunity to outline to the House the history behind Glasnevin Educate Together and why it does not have permanent recognition at this time.  Multi-denominational schools serve a broad demographic area.  On this basis, the north inner city, including Glasnevin, has for a number of years been served by two such schools, namely, the north Dublin national school project and Dublin 7 Educate Together national school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1689">Glasnevin Educate Together commenced operation in September 2002 as Dublin North-Central Educate Together national school, subsequently changing its name to Glasnevin Educate Together national school.  The school was given provisional recognition at that time because the Department accepted the argument made by its proposers that there was a need for a separate multi-denominational school to serve the Clontarf-Marino-Fairview area of Dublin.  When provisional recognition was granted, it was a condition that the patron provided suitable accommodation for the school in the area it intended to serve and this accommodation was required to be capable of meeting the school's needs until the Department was in a position to provide permanent accommodation, assuming the school, ultimately, achieved this status.  To date,  the patron has not been able to do this and the school is located on a temporary basis in premises outside the Clontarf-Marino-Fairview area, the intended catchment area for the school.  It continues to be the Department's intention to relocate this school to that area if and when suitable accommodation becomes available and as the funding situation allows.</p>
            <p eId="para_1690">For the purposes of clarity, the Minister for Education and Science would like to point out that each new school is generally established with provisional recognition to ensure, among other things, that it has a long-term viability and that it is operating in accordance with the Rules for National Schools.  Schools only attract capital funding when permanent recognition is awarded, although schools with temporary recognition receive State support by way of payment of teachers' salaries, start-up and rental grant aid, school transport, where appropriate, and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">Four main criteria are considered before granting permanent recognition to a school.  These are whether the school is operating in accordance with the Rules for National Schools, whether the school has demonstrated viability in terms of enrolment, whether the school's accommodation is deemed suitable to meet its needs until the Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation and whether the school is meeting a need which is not being met by existing schools.  While the Department is satisfied that Glasnevin Educate Together meets the first two criteria, it is not satisfied that it has met the third and fourth, although the fourth is the over-riding issue, given, as the Minister said, the north city is served by two multi-denominational education providers.  While it is the patron's responsibility to secure alternative suitable accommodation, the Department is willing to assist it in identifying this.  To this end, it has asked the OPW to endeavour to identify suitable accommodation.  The difficulty of identifying appropriate accommodation for school use at a reasonable cost in this built-up area, however, should not be underestimated.  The Department is willing to consider any options the school might present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">When a solution has been found to this aspect of the matter and the school has had an opportunity to demonstrate viability in its original intended location, the Department will consider the question of permanent recognition again.  I thank the Deputy again for raising this matter and for allowing me to explain the background to this case.  I assure him that the Department wishes to see the school properly located and flourishing in its own area and it will provide any assistance it can to achieve this.  As a Deputy for Dublin North-Central, I would be glad to take an ongoing interest in this matter.</p>

          <heading>Special Educational Needs.</heading>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_644">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1693">A total of 561 children are enrolled in Scoil Mhuire na mBráithre CBS, Clounalour, Tralee, County Kerry, approximately 40% of whom may be categorised as international children or new Irish.  They have either been born in another country or their parents have come to this country as economic migrants or asylum seekers.  Many of the children have benefited from language support.  It provides them with easier access to all subjects and improves their competency in the English language.  It gives them greater confidence and improved language communications skills in the school and the community and it makes it easier for teachers to communicate with them to pass on knowledge.  In many cases it helps their parents to improve their English language skills and some children even become the spokesperson for their family.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">The Department of Education and Science guidelines allow for six language support teachers when a school has 121 children with language needs.  However, currently 163 children are in receipt of language support in the school.  The majority of them started school with little or no English.  This still only gives the school an allocation of six language support teachers who are currently employed on a temporary basis.  This pupil-language support teacher ratio is, therefore, approximately 27:1.  However, when the proposed cuts are applied to the school, this will lead to an increase in the pupil-language support teacher ratio to 81:1 and a loss of four teachers.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree the loss of four teachers who provide this vital support to the new Irish will have a major effect on the school.  It is impossible to understand how such a ratio would enable these children to acquire the necessary language skills to access the school curriculum and to keep pace with their Irish counterparts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">The most vulnerable children in the school will also be forced to suffer.  As a non-DEIS school, grants to help children from less well-off families with the purchase of uniforms, track suits, school books, school trips and other school activities will be abolished.  All equipment and resource grants for teachers who work with children with learning difficulties will be abolished.  Funding to the school will significantly reduce, with cuts of €3,000 in the Traveller grant, €4,000 in resource teacher grants, €10,000 in the free book grant and €17,000 in the disadvantage, non-DEIS, grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">Historically, the school has opened its doors to children from all socio-economic sectors of the community and, as a consequence, it has large numbers of children from the international community along with children from disadvantaged backgrounds and children from the Traveller community.  For a long time, Tralee has been highlighted as an economic blackspot with a large number of families experiencing socio-economic disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">Furthermore, there may be a perception that many international families have started to return to their country of origin.  However, the experience of the school is that its enrolment figures of international children have increased steadily in recent years and have done so again this year, hence the figure of 163 children this September.  The enrolment figures for September 2009 indicate that the numbers will continue to grow next year.  The school's experience over the years is that many of the international children are enrolled later in the year and many more are enrolled during the summer months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">As a result of the cuts introduced in the budget, the most vulnerable children in the school, including the new Irish, will suffer as the grants which help with these children's needs have been abolished.  These cuts cannot be justified and this is indicated by the number of marches throughout the country.  I have never seen teachers protest as much.  Last weekend, a major march took place through the Minister of State's home city of Dublin.  These cuts will cause the maximum damage to the children's education and will generate minimum savings for the Exchequer.  Surely preferential and sympathetic consideration should be given to schools such as Scoil Mhuire na mBráithre CBS which has a large enrolment of international students, Traveller families and students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_1699">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The priority this Government attaches to providing for quality education, as did previous Fianna Fáil led Governments, is evident in the budget allocations to the Department since 1997.  This year alone, the Government allocated more than €9.3 billion to education.  This continued prioritisation of education over the past 11 years has reversed the historic under-investment in areas such as school facilities, services for children with special needs and those in disadvantaged areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  The various impacts at school level were included in the budget day announcements.  Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">When the country was able to afford it the Government reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of pupils per teacher from 35 pupils down to the current level of 27 pupils.  The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher has to be viewed in this context.  Significant additional supports have been provided particularly in the area of special education.</p>

            <p eId="para_1726">The Government also reduced class sizes for the most disadvantaged in DEIS schools to an average of one teacher for every 20 pupils in junior classes and an average of one teacher for every 24 pupils in senior classes and these will not change in 2009.  When one adds up all the teachers in the system there is one teacher for every 16 pupils in primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">It will be necessary in the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone.  While teacher numbers are important numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the single most important factor, far and above anything else, in improving educational outcomes for children.  Ensuring high-quality teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit it represents a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and the teacher unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">The Department of Education and Science will advise individual schools in the normal way on their staffing and grant allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes, including notification to schools, will commence early in the new year and Scoil Mhuire na mBráithre CBS primary school will also receive its notification in due course.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers the Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">The Government is committed to continuing to invest in education but we have to invest at a level that is consistent with what we can afford and what is sustainable given the economic circumstances.  It is important that we explain the general background to the budget and how it affects this school and all other schools throughout the country.  Therefore, stabilising the public finances is an essential first step in securing employment, future economic prosperity and ultimately the capacity to maintain public services, including education.  By taking the necessary measures now, we will be well positioned to enable our country to take full advantage when the economic situation improves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">I have taken on board what the Deputy stated and if the school has a particular case with regard to language support I have no doubt it will be put to the Department in due course.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1733">My Department has introduced a risk management policy to ensure that appropriate actions are taken by management throughout the organisation to identify and manage effectively the risks to which the organisation may be exposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">The risk management policy seeks to identify and assess the strategic, operational, financial and reputation risks facing the Department and to outline measures to minimise such risks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">As part of the implementation of this policy, risk registers were introduced in my Department in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">The risk register is updated on an annual basis and reference is made to FÁS in the 2005 register and each subsequent register. The register does not include a reference to specific sections within FÁS.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_672">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1739">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Priority Question No. 67 earlier in today's Session.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">The Tánaiste met with the Small Firms Association (SFA) and the Irish Small and Medium Sized Enterprises Association (ISME) on 19th November 2008 to discuss their concerns on a range of issues impacting on small business, including access to credit from financial institutions, arising from the credit crunch.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">While the banking sector is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan T.D, in my Department we have, nevertheless, working closely with the Minister and officials of his Department on encouraging the banks to assume their responsibility to provide support to economic development and, in particular, to provide credit to SMEs. As I highlighted earlier, a number of Irish banks have over the last week, announced significant financial lending packages to assist SMEs. In addition, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has indicated that it is in discussions with four Irish banks in relation to its recently announced €30 billion facility to provide loans to SMEs through commercial banks.  I very much welcome these important developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">My Department's continuous support for indigenous companies arises through maintaining a positive business environment and through particular interventions from the State development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the County and City Enterprise Boards.  The significant allocations in my Department's Estimates for 2009, will ensure that we continue to build on this strategy for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">Enterprise Ireland is the agency with responsibility for supporting the development of Irish companies with ambitions to grow in world markets. Many of its client companies are small to medium in size. Enterprise Ireland recognises the varied challenges facing such companies in the context of the changing economic environment and partners with companies to address their needs in a holistic manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">Attractive BES and Seed Capital schemes contribute to the provision of capital investment across a range of SMEs. In addition to this, Enterprise Ireland is directly involved in Venture Capital initiatives also attracting investment for businesses.  As a result of the Government's investment of €175m channelled through EI, 7 new venture capital funds have raised over €500m which is available to invest in the Irish SME sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">Also funded through my Department, the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards provide support to small businesses or micro-enterprises with 10 employees or less.  CEB funding will increase next year by almost €3 million, or 9%, to €34.8 million and this represents a further indication of the Government's commitment to supporting this sector of business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">FÁS through their One Step Up programme is encouraging employees to increase their competency levels and promoting an ethos of lifelong learning in the workplace. Its key intervention in this regard is the Competency Development Programme.  It offers workers different types of training programmes directed at various skill levels across major economic sectors. These training programmes are available to employees of SMEs.  FÁS also have a number of other training programmes aimed at upskilling SME's namely, Skillnets and FÁS Strategic Alliance programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">The Government has also made very considerable progress on the implementation of the Small Business Forum Report's recommendations. This progress is reflected through a substantial package of financial measures and schemes introduced to assist the sector over the last two years, including fiscal measures in the 2007 and 2008 Finance Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">SMEs are central to our economic development and the range of measures and supports outlined above will continue to help the sector adapt to the current economic climate.  These measures will be kept under review to ensure that they remain appropriate to the current circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">In our Department we will continue to remain in regular contact with the Department of Finance and will ensure that the issue of availability of credit to SMEs is kept under constant review. We will also continue to consult with ISME and SFA on all issues impacting on small businesses and we welcome their continued valuable input.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1753">I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 89 and 118 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1754">The Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 is designed to give effect to shared commitments in Part 2 of the 10 Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, to greatly increase public confidence in the system of employment law compliance.  The establishment of a new, statutory office to secure better compliance with employment law through information and enforcement activities, supported by up to 90 Labour Inspectors with extensive powers, formed one aspect of these commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1755">Further to the Transitional Agreement under Towards 2016 concluded in September last, an intensive consultation process is currently underway with the stakeholders  with a view to finalising issues in the Bill.  Discussions are also taking place with the Office of the Attorney General on any remaining amendments and draft provisions.  The intention is to have all outstanding work on the Bill completed without delay so that the Bill can proceed to Second Stage early in the first Dáil term of 2009.  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) will be established one month after the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 is signed into law by the President.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">We have already strengthened inspection and enforcement. Recent media coverage of abuses were a timely reminder of why the Government set up the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) as a key outcome of the Social Partnership process.  The issues that have been highlighted are disturbing. However, these issues are not unknown to us — in over 20,000 workplace inspections this year, NERA has determined an average breach rate of 21%.  NERA has had considerable success since it started operations in 2007 in ensuring that abuses of workers rights and entitlements will not go unchecked.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">The Social Partnership Agreement ‘Towards 2016', provides for greater co-ordination between organisations concerned with employment rights compliance, with a view to realising the considerable potential for synergy that exists in this area. In particular, the Agreement provides that authorised officers of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) will join with officers of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units. The role of these Joint Investigation Units, or JIUs, is to address areas where evidence suggests that non-compliance with employment rights legislation exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2007, which came into operation on 30th March, 2007, provides for the disclosure of relevant employment data between the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment/NERA. This legislation effectively enables NERA to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to work together in Joint Investigation Units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">Since the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2007, exchange of information activity has taken place between the bodies in a number of specific cases. In addition, JIUs, involving NERA with Revenue and/or Social and Family Affairs have also taken place.  In 2007, joint investigation activity, involving NERA for the first time, took place during the Construction Industry Campaign in May-July 2007.  In 2008, joint investigation activity has been undertaken in a number of sectors including the catering, the hotel and the haulage sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">The three inspectorates are proactively promoting and encouraging joint activity at a central and local level.  I understand that a series of regional meetings have been held recently involving the relevant inspectors in those regions.  These meetings have ensured that all officers understand their respective roles and potential synergies arising from working together within the parameters set out in the legislation.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1762">Government policy remains firmly focused on growing competitiveness and building on the success that has already been achieved by both indigenous and foreign-owned firms competing on world markets.  We are also committed to promoting competition, raising consumer awareness and tackling administrative burdens in order to drive competition for goods and services traded domestically.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">Enhancing productivity growth is the cornerstone of our competitiveness. The Enterprise Development Agencies under my Department (SFI, EI, IDA and CCEBs) have a capital allocation of  €495 million in 2009, which will be spent on productivity enhancing investments such as R&amp;D, innovation, better use of ICT, and training and management development. In addition, part of our long term strategy for achieving productivity improvements is to enhance the skills of the Irish workforce, as set out in the National Skills Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">In the shorter term, the next few years can be seen as a period of opportunity as we seek to re-situate ourselves in terms of our national competitiveness, and to place ourselves in the optimal position to benefit from the eventual upturn in the international economy as well as from our longer-term investments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">IDA Ireland has continued to be successful in attracting new investment to Ireland, even in the current economic climate.  Since the beginning of November alone, it has made announcements which are expected to provide a total of 1,000 new jobs in a variety of sectors, across a range of skills (such as manufacturing, R&amp;D and European Headquarters operations) and spread throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">We are working consistently and successfully to build Irish exports in world markets.  For example, contracts worth €40 million in new export sales have been signed by Irish companies during the recent Enterprise Ireland trade mission which the Tánaiste led to the United Arab Emirates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">In order to sustain and grow the manufacturing sector, Irish based manufacturing enterprises will be encouraged and assisted to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.  We intend to establish shortly a new High Level Manufacturing Forum to progress the recommendations contained in the Manufacturing Report published last April and recently agreed by the Social Partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">In the future, the major impetus for growth will come from expansion of our  services sectors.  Last September, the Tánaiste launched the report of the Services Strategy Group, "Catching the Wave: A Services Strategy for Ireland".  Ireland is already the 10th highest exporter of services in the world. This report will guide the development of our services policies and strategy into the future, with a view  to fully exploiting the opportunities that this sector presents. In particular, the strategy will focus on maximizing the performance of companies that are already active on export markets, on encouraging companies that are currently only trading locally to expand their markets abroad, and on fostering a new breed of start-up services companies with exporting potential. My Department is working in conjunction with other Departments to progress the implementation of these recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">While any job losses are regrettable, and are deeply distressing for those concerned, we must remember that we still have a historically high number of people at work today compared to a decade ago — over 2 million — and that we are still creating high-value jobs across the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">Through our pro-enterprise policies, ongoing investment in critical infrastructure under the NDP, our low taxes on business and workers and our balanced regulatory regime, the government are committed to ensuring that we continue to build an environment for enterprise that remains among the most favourable in the world.</p>

            <p eId="para_1772">In September this year, I requested the National Consumer Agency to undertake a survey into the underlying reasons as to why pump prices for petrol and diesel had not fallen in line with the drop in the wholesale price of oil. As part of its work, the Agency is benchmarking movements in prices in Ireland against those in other EU countries and it is examining the frequency and the timeliness in which changes in the wholesale price are being passed on to consumers. The Agency has been conducting surveys of retail prices throughout the country, and is engaging in a series of meetings and contacts with, <i>inter alia</i>, the main distributors and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">Notwithstanding that the average retail price of both petrol and diesel is now down to a little over €1 per litre, which represents a considerable reduction from the much higher prices of the summer, it is particularly important in these difficult economic times to ensure that the benefits of the dramatic decline in wholesale fuel prices are passed onto consumers and businesses to the greatest extent possible. It was for this reason that I requested the National Consumer Agency to undertake its survey into this matter. I look forward to receiving the Agency's report, which I understand will be finalized in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1775">A consultancy review of the operation of the Wage Subsidy Scheme has recently been completed on behalf of my Department.

            <p eId="para_1776">The reforms comprise:</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">removing the productivity labelling process;</p>

            <p eId="para_1782">The review includes a recommendation that Wage Subsidy Scheme participants who are medical cardholders should be allowed to retain their medical card eligibility indefinitely.  This is currently being discussed with the Department of Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">The review also includes a recommendation that Wage Subsidy Scheme participants should be able to retain a link to their Disability Allowance status.  In this regard the Department of Social and Family Affairs has confirmed that the existing administrative arrangements whereby people in receipt of a disability payment who take up employment, e.g., under the Back-to-Work Allowance scheme, may return directly to that payment in the event that the employment does not continue for any reason, will apply equally to WSS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">It is anticipated that the various reforms to the operation of the Wage Subsidy Scheme will be implemented in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">A consultancy review of the Supported Employment Programme has been completed on behalf of FÁS.  Following consultations between my Department, FÁS and key Stakeholders, a number of agreed actions will be adopted in line with the review recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of the programme.  A key adjustment to the future operation of the programme will be to reduce the minimum number of hours per week work requirement from 18 to 8 hours relating to employment in the open labour market.</p>

        <b>Deputy Arthur Morgan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         the measures being taken to tackle the deterioration of Irish manufacturing exports. 
        [44918/08]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_677">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1789">The economic growth that Ireland has experienced for more than a decade was built on the co-operation, collaboration and hard work of businesses, citizens and government with the core objective of increased prosperity for all. In this time, Ireland faced a number of critical economic challenges and successfully overcame them while becoming one of the world's most open economies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">The Irish owned enterprise sector has proven itself to be capable of, and critical to, meeting such challenges head-on by adapting, improving and focusing efforts on securing long-term success. Enterprise Ireland, the agency with responsibility for the development of manufacturing and internationally traded services, continues to drive this agenda of meeting current and future economic challenges by supporting the overall development of Irish companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">The export figures for Enterprise Ireland client companies supports this view. From 2005 to 2007 the agency set itself the target of increasing exports in client companies by €3 billion, and it exceeded this target by over €1 billion in the period. Of course, the global economic downturn will affect exports in 2008 but Enterprise Ireland has been striving to its utmost to ensure the impact is minimised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">Today, it is evident that the Irish enterprise sector faces a difficult international climate, making it imperative that it bolster its competitiveness, focus its investment and generate innovative solutions in the face of testing economic conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">Ireland has not been a low cost economy for some time now, and manufacturers in particular have been facing increased competition from producers in lower cost economies. The manufacturing sector in Ireland has evolved noticeably since 2000, in terms of the composition of industry and the nature of activities, and is likely to continue to do so. The model of manufacturing in developed economies has changed and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace. Irish based manufacturing enterprises will have to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation.  Innovation, and the productivity gains that flow from it are the new foundations for competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">Enterprise Ireland provides a broad suite of programmes to assist companies adapt and grow by focusing on internationalisation, competitiveness, entrepreneurship, innovation, R&amp;D, business infrastructure and engagement with third level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">For example, a significant element of Enterprise Ireland's Financial Offer is the Growth Fund which supports Enterprise Ireland SME clients taking on an innovative market-led development plan to increase sales and develop exports through improving their productivity and competitiveness.  Funding is available to support a range of activities including capital investment, recruitment of key managers and management development and staff training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1796">Productivity and management capability improvements are also essential in helping Irish manufacturing companies to reach the standards needed to successfully compete in the global market place.  The Enterprise Ireland Productivity Fund provides assistance to help SME client companies achieve greater competitiveness by increasing their export potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">Apart from the activity of Enterprise Ireland, the Social Partners agreed, as part of the recently concluded review of "Towards 2016", that a Manufacturing Forum should be established, in line with the recommendations of the High Level Group on Manufacturing.  This matter is currently being progressed by my Department in consultation with the Department of An Taoiseach and the Social Partners.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1809">I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 98 and 117 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">I refer the Deputies to my answer on Thursday, 20th November 2008 to Questions Nos. 43, 51 &amp; 52 that relate to the same matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">The Health and Safety Authority is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and associated statutory provisions.  There have been 54 workplace deaths reported to the Authority so far in 2008 (as at 04.12.08). For the first 11 months of this year, there were 54 workplace deaths.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">For the first 11 months of previous years, the figures are: 63 in 2007, 44 in 2006, 70 in 2005, 49 in 2004, 65 in 2003, and 51 in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">The number of deaths recorded in workplace accidents during 2007 was 67 compared to 51 in 2006 with a considerable amount of this increase being accounted for by a number of fishing accidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">Construction and agriculture are consistently the highest risk sectors in which to work, based on the number of fatalities. Of the 67 fatalities in the year 2007, 18 occurred in the construction sector.  This was an increase of 5 fatal accidents on the 2006 figure. The construction sector ranked third in relation to fatality rates, at 5 per 100,000 workers, in 2007. This figure is higher than the rate of 4.3 fatalities per 100,000 workers in 2006 (the lowest recorded rate for the sector) but maintains the general downward trend in the fatality rate seen since 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">Non-fatal accidents, resulting in absence of more than three days from normal work following the accident, are required to be reported to the Authority.  There have been 6,804 non-fatal accidents reported to the Authority so far in 2008 (as at 04.12.08).</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">There were 7,757 non-fatal work related accidents reported to the Health and Safety Authority in 2007.  This compares with nearly 8,000 for 2006, 8,104 for 2005, 8,453 for 2004, 6,622 for 2003, and 7,746 for 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">It is not possible to be satisfied that all accidents at workplaces are reported but I am not aware that the Authority has come across evidence that suggests under reporting of workplace accidents resulting in fatalities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">The Health and Safety Authority is carrying out a programme of 17,500 targeted and random workplace inspections in 2008. The inspection programme is targeted on the basis of risk, relevant accident triggers, levels of compliance and specific identified workplace trends.  In relation to the construction sector, I am informed that the Authority has carried out over 6,700 construction inspections to date in 2008. Also, it continues to implement the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 and the Safe System of Work Plan (SSWP).</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">Recognising the two highest risk areas, the Health and Safety Authority has a particular focus on the agricultural and construction sectors.  Earlier this year, I formally launched the Construction Safety Partnership Plan.  On the agriculture side, I attended and addressed the first All Island Farm Safety Conference in Monaghan in June of this year. This conference was co-hosted by the Health and Safety Authority along with the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland (HSENI).</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">I have encouraged the Authority to continue and develop its partnership with Teagasc and to follow through on the development and distribution of the Farm Safety Code of Practice which was distributed to 160,000 farm households in December 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">Safe workplaces can ultimately only be delivered by those who work in them. Day to day responsibility for safety at work rests on the shoulders of employers and employees.  The Health and Safety Authority in carrying out its inspection function spends a lot of its time advising as to safety at work and safe systems of work. In general, this advice is well received and only where there is a failure to comply with the Authority's advice or a real and immediate threat to health and safety does the Authority commence enforcement procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">The Authority, also in its advocacy role, publishes guidelines, codes of practice and other advice on safety on a regular basis as well as organising sectoral seminars or conferences to promote the occupational safety and health message. These activities, as well as the information on the Authority's website, should be heeded by all those in the workplace in order to improve our safety record.</p>

            <p eId="para_1829">The Report of the High Level Group has identified over €20m in cost savings to business as a result of simplified administrative procedures in various parts of Government.  The Government's commitment is to reduce the administrative burden on Irish business by 25% by 2012 and this demanding target is a key priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">The High Level Group is tasked with identifying where legislation has imposed an administrative burden, or "red tape", on business and with recommending ways to reduce that burden, without undermining the policy objectives behind the regulation.  The work of the Group is focused on concrete measures in specific policy areas, including taxation, statistics, environment, health and safety, employment and company law.  The first report of the Group sets out a number of instances where procedures have been simplified, making it easier for business to deal with Government, for example: e-filing of annual returns to the Companies Registration Office; on-line access to tax clearance certificates for Government contracts; increased exemption thresholds for VAT registration; and higher thresholds exempting small businesses from having to conduct a statutory audit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">In addition, further changes to reduce the burden on business are expected in the procedures surrounding waste collection permits, road haulage permits and employment permits.  In addition to the work of the High Level Group, my Department has put in place a process across all Departments that will measure the administrative cost of red tape on business arising from domestic legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">As in all the other countries that have done this, it will take about a year and a half to complete the measurement process.  In line with the recommendation of the Business Regulation Forum we are adopting a prioritised approach.  Initially, all Government Departments are required to list the Information Obligations which their regulations impose on business.  From that listing, Departments will assess, in consultation with business, which requirements are the most burdensome.  They will then measure the actual cost to business of the most burdensome requirements.  At that point the most appropriate approach to achieving the Government target to reduce the administrative burden of domestic regulation on business by 25% by 2012 will be determined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">With regard to future regulations the Government has agreed that all Departments should measure the administrative cost on business and specifically examine the impact on small business.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
            <p eId="para_1835">As already outlined to this House in reply to a similar question from the Deputy on 20 November last, the Tánaiste has met with the Small Firms Association (SFA) and with the Irish Small and Medium Sized Enterprises Association (ISME) to discuss their concerns on a range of issues impacting on small business as a result of the current economic situation.  I am very much aware of the difficulties facing small firms in relation to access to credit finance and the impact of late payments on the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1836">It has previously been outlined to this House in the reply to Deputy John O'Mahony's Question No. 13 on 20 November 2008, the position in relation to late payments.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1837">Payment terms in commercial transactions are determined by the parties concerned and the responsibility for the collection of those payments and general credit control rests with the selling enterprise.  The issue of late payments in commercial transactions is addressed by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002).</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">In accordance with these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest ("late payment interest") on the amount outstanding.  Interest shall apply until such time as payment is made by the purchaser.  The current interest rate applicable is 11.00% per annum or 0.0301% per day.  This rate is set as at 1 January and 1 July each year at a rate of 7 percentage points above the European Central Bank interest rate on its most recent main refinancing operation.  In the absence of any agreed payment date between the parties, late payment interest falls due after 30 days has elapsed.  The 2002 Regulations also provide for compensation for debt recovery costs.  Greater use of these provisions would assist in achieving earlier payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">In addition, under the Regulations the use of terms that are grossly unfair may be unenforceable and such terms may be challenged in Court on the basis of criteria specified in the Regulations.  Organisations representing small and medium sized enterprises may challenge any terms that they feel breach the Regulations.  It is open to any such organisation to pursue this operation.  However, I understand that this provision of the Regulations has not been availed of, to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">The EU Commission has indicated that it will be proposing amendments to the Late Payments Directive early in 2009.  Their intention is to simplify the provisions of the original Directive and to clarify issues such as interest payments, with a view to discouraging late payers and guaranteeing that SMEs are paid within time for all commercial transactions.  Ireland will work actively in negotiating amendments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1841">I am happy to continue to consult with SFA and ISME on this issue, and indeed, on all issues impacting on small business.</p>

            <p eId="para_1851">Paragraph 13 of the Schedule to the Labour Services Act, 1987, provides that "Each ordinary member of An Foras shall be paid, out of moneys at the disposal of An Foras, such remuneration (if any) and allowances for expenses incurred by him (if any) as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may sanction."  This provision is the statutory basis for the actions described below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">The remuneration paid to members of the boards of State bodies is determined by Department of Finance. FÁS is designated as a Category 2 body for the purposes of such remuneration.  The current rates since 1 January 2006 are €24,000 for the Chairman and €14,000 for Directors.  My Department confirmed these rates in writing to the Secretary of the FÁS Board in 2006 shortly after the current Board's appointment.  The serving civil servants on the Board do not receive a fee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">The Department of Finance determines overall travel policy in the Civil Service and the wider public service.

In this regard, I welcome the statement by the Comptroller and Auditor General at a recent Public Accounts Committee hearing that he would soon begin his examination of the effectiveness of management and control systems in the FÁS organisation and that he would finalise his terms of reference shortly in consultation with my Department and the Public Accounts Committee.</p>

The Deputy will recall that following the welcome developments in the European Parliament, I invited the Social Partners to discussions with my Department.  These discussions will aim at agreeing a framework within which agency workers in Ireland would achieve equal treatment within an agreed timeframe having regard also to the need for flexibility in enterprises.  The proposed Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 concluded by the Social Partners contains a commitment to developing such a framework.</p>

            <p eId="para_1895">As both the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority were established under statute, it will be necessary to give effect to the newly merged body by way of primary legislation.  Whilst I am committed to introducing this legislation as soon as possible, it is not possible at this early stage to give a precise date as to when the necessary legislation will be published.  Similarly, whilst it is expected that the synergies arising from the merger of the two bodies will result in savings to the Exchequer, particularly in areas such as shared services, it is not possible to precisely quantify the amount of savings involved at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1911">These are demand led programmes which are promoted by FÁS staff in the respective regions on a continuous basis.  Following a recent review, the Wage Subsidy Scheme has been placed on a permanent footing and a number of reforms are being made which are aimed at enhancing the operation of the scheme, and improving take up by both employers and people with disabilities.  The reforms comprise: removing the productivity labelling process, introducing a training element to the Wage Subsidy Scheme, allowing Wage Subsidy Scheme employees and employers to avail of support under the Supported Employment Programme, promoting the Wage Subsidy Scheme to increase the awareness of the Scheme, and streamlining the administration of the Scheme</p>

It is anticipated that the reforms will be implemented in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_1915">In the period since the establishment of FÁS under the Labour Services Act, 1987 the Minister sanctioned, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the pay and staffing arrangements for FAS and various other grade specific increases from time to time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">Increases in remuneration for the staff of FÁS are normally set in the context of Social Partnership agreements.  Under the terms of the current agreement, Towards 2016, payment of each of the public services pay increases is dependent on verification of satisfactory achievement in relation to co-operation with flexibility and modernisation.  The verification process applies to each sector, organisation and grade within the public service. FÁS submitted themselves to this verification process and following an examination of its progress the Department approved the payments.  The most recent approval in this context was conveyed to FÁS on 28 November 2008 in relation to the increase of 2.5% under Section 27.17 of Towards 2016 with effect from 1 September 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_1919">The Towards 2016 Transitional Agreement provides for a number of commitments, including some involving legislation, aimed at strengthening protections for employment standards, while also ensuring that Ireland continues to provide an excellent environment for business and job creation. Commitments that are likely to have a legislative dimension include enactment of the Employment Law Compliance Bill, the development of a national framework on the employment and rights of temporary agency workers, while prohibiting their use in the case of official strikes or lock outs, addressing the issue of employee representation and appropriate legislative framework, strengthening the existing legislation underpinning the Joint Labour Committee and Registered Employment Agreement systems, prohibition of the victimisation of employees engaged in trade union activities and of the incentivisation of non-membership of trade unions and transposition of the optional pension provisions of the Transfer of Undertakings Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">I look forward to working with the Social Partners and my Ministerial colleagues in making speedy progress on the commitments entered into under this Agreement, including those requiring legislative enactment.  It is difficult to be specific about timetables for legislation as this is primarily a matter for the House and for the Seanad and is also influenced by the availability of legal advisory and parliamentary drafting resources which are faced with ever increasing competing demands.  However, the Deputy may be assured that no effort will be spared to meet the commitments in the Transitional Agreement.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1922">Employment and unemployment are measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) and published by the Central Statistics Office.  Statistics are available on a quarterly basis only.  The latest quarterly data indicates that there were 2,120,800 in employment in Quarter 3 2008, a fall of 25,200 on the corresponding period in 2007.  This release also indicates that unemployment had increased by 53,300 in the same period. The difference between the two figures relate to an increase in the Total Labour Force of 28,100.  The table hereunder sets out numbers in employment at Quarter 3 for the years 2003-2008 and indicates that employment increased by 284,400 over the five year period.  While the rate of employment growth is slowing, it must be viewed in the context of historically unprecedented numbers of people in work. Since 1997, over half a million new jobs have been created in Ireland and the number in employment still exceeds 2.1 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working together so they can respond quickly to the increase in unemployment.  As regards employment and job search services, I have provided FÁS with €4 million to subsidise the employment of redundant apprentices in 2009. FÁS has, with the Local Employment Services provided by Area-Based Partnerships, geared up its Employment Services further to provide increased capacity for expected increased referrals from the Live Register.</p>
            <p eId="para_1924">FÁS has also put in place a series of actions to facilitate redundant apprentices in completing their studies.  Among these include redundant apprentices being allowed to progress to their next off-the-job phase of training without having to do the next on-the-job phase.  FÁS has specific mechanisms in place to deal with redundancies and/or company closures. It offers a tailored approach as early as possible to the workers affected with a view to assisting them to access alternative employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1925">In relation to training for those who become unemployed, I have given FÁS an additional €5 million for training the unemployed and FÁS will increase total training places in 2009.  FÁS will also be providing a range of certified, short, flexible, modular programmes in construction sector activities that are expected to remain buoyant, despite the slowdown in construction.  FÁS has also established a training fund to enable a speedy response to identified re-training needs, for low skilled and redundant craft workers. In 2009 FÁS will open evening classes to people who are unemployed without payment of a fee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1926">We are fully committed to strengthening the competitiveness and productive capacity of the economy.  Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability that are technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1927">My Department and its Agencies have a vital part to play ensuring that the country is well-positioned to progress when circumstances improve. One of the main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1928">To underpin long-term competitiveness, my objective is to ensure that we build up the productive capacity of the economy through investing in people.  I am doing this directly through the Skills Strategy.  We will continue to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive, should they need to find alternative employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1929">Creating the best framework conditions to enable innovation to flourish, which in turn leads to increased productivity and competitiveness, will continue to guide our overall policy approach to tackling the competitiveness challenges ahead.  There are a number of key policies, which the Government is implementing to maintain and enhance our competitiveness and to invest for the future.  The National Skills Strategy, the Strategy for Science, Technology &amp; Innovation (SSTI) and the National Development Plan will ensure Ireland remains a key location for leading edge research and development, and the quality jobs it can deliver. Achieving higher growth rates in productivity than our competitor countries will be important for international competitiveness and securing sustainable wage growth.</p>

            <p eId="para_1945">The Government decided, in October 2006, to continue to require that nationals of Romania and Bulgaria apply for work permits in order to participate in the Irish labour market, but giving those nationals preference over non-European Economic Area nationals.  The Government was informed in its decision by the very significant inflow of economic migrants Ireland had experienced since May 2004, when nationals of the EU 10 Member States were allowed to participate in the Irish labour market without work permits.  The Government felt at the time that it was appropriate to take stock, be cautious and concentrate on the integration needs of those who had already come to live and work here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">EU countries that imposed transitional restrictions had to justify their decision to the European Commission initially, and must continue to do so at intervals thereafter.  Countries were allowed an initial, so-called Phase 1, period of two years ending on 31 December 2008 during which to impose restrictions.  Before the end of 2008, Member States must notify the European Commission whether they plan to continue during the Phase 2 period 2009-2011 any restrictions imposed during Phase 1, or whether they intend to remove the restrictions and accordingly the Government will be considering this matter for decision ahead of the end year deadline.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">Having regard to options open to the Government, the Employment Permits Act 2006 provides the legal basis for three options in relation to access to the Irish labour market by nationals of Bulgaria and Romania: continue to have Romanian and Bulgarian nationals apply for work permits with the current conditions and requirements, but, as before, giving those nationals preference over non-European Economic Area nationals; have Romanian and Bulgarian nationals apply for work permits (mainly for monitoring purposes) and issue them on the basis of job offers, without the requirement to advertise with FÁS; or grant access to the Irish labour market without any restrictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1948">In considering these options, the Government will take into account the following factors: the positions of the other Member States that also imposed restrictions; current and forecast economic and labour market conditions in Ireland; the views of the representatives of employers and trade unions, as well as the views of representatives of the Governments of the two countries concerned. A decision on this matter is due to be made by Government before the end of December.</p>

            <p eId="para_1952">Trade unions holding a negotiating licence are free to engage in collective bargaining on wages and conditions of employment. Ireland's system of industrial relations is based on a voluntary approach with terms and conditions of employment being determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the parties, without the intervention of the State. The collective bargaining process can cover the entire range of issues arising from the employment relationship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">The State has sought to facilitate the bargaining process through establishing, by legislation, a number of agencies to assist in the resolution of disputes, including the Labour Relations Commission/Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Court. There are also statutoryprovisions designed to back up the voluntary process in areas where collective bargaining does not operate effectively. The most important provisions are those concerning Joint Labour Committees and Registered Employment Agreements. In addition, the 2004 Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, provide mechanisms for the resolution of disputes in situations where collective bargaining does not occur and where the internal dispute resolution procedures that are normally used fail to resolve the dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1954">The issue of employee representation was considered in the context of the recent Social Partnership talks. In that context, the Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 provides for the establishment of a review process which will consider the legal and other steps which are required to enable the mechanisms which were established under previous Agreements to operate as they had been intended. The review is to be completed by the end of March 2009 with a view to enactment of the necessary legislation in June 2009.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1960">The total number of people recorded on the Live Register for November 2008 is 268,586, showing an increase of about 106,864 in the 12 month period.  It should be noted that the Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment.  It includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">Employment and unemployment are measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey or QNHS, and published by the Central Statistics Office.  2,120,800 are in employment while unemployment is at 160,600 for the most recent Quarter, June to August 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">The rise in unemployment, while regrettable, must be seen in the light of the unprecedented growth in the economy and in employment in the past number of years.  Overall employment growth was driven by significant growth in employment in the construction sector.  Such levels of growth could not last indefinitely.  The resultant rise in unemployment is now compounded by the international credit crisis in the economy and a general slowdown in employment in all sectors.  Ireland is not alone in finding itself it this position; many countries throughout Europe and around the world are experiencing similar difficulties in their labour markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working together so they can respond quickly to the increase in unemployment. For example: As regards employment and job search services, I have provided FÁS with €4 million to subsidise the employment of redundant apprentices in 2009. FÁS has, with the Local Employment Services provided by Area-Based Partnerships, geared up its Employment Services further to provide increased capacity for expected increased referrals from the Live Register. FÁS has also put in place a series of actions to facilitate redundant apprentices in completing their studies.  Among these include redundant apprentices being allowed to progress to their next off-the-job phase of training without having to do the next on-the-job phase. FÁS has specific mechanisms in place to deal with redundancies and/or company closures.  It offers a tailored approach as early as possible to the workers affected with a view to assisting them to access alternative employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1964">As regards training for those who become unemployed, I have given FÁS an additional €5 million for training the unemployed and FÁS will increase total training places in 2009. FÁS will also be providing a range of certified, short, flexible, modular programmes in construction sector activities which are expected to remain buoyant despite the slowdown in construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">FÁS has also established a training fund to enable a speedy response to identified re-training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers.  In 2009 FÁS will open evening classes to people who are unemployed without payment of a fee. As regards promoting enterprise development to create new jobs, the Enterprise Development Agencies of my Department, including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, are working to ensure that we continue to grow the economy and jobs even in the current more challenging environment.  The pipeline of new business for which IDA Ireland is competing is as strong as at any time in recent years.  To facilitate this we need to ensure that our competitiveness is sustained into the future.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1977">I assume the Deputy is referring to the recent Consumer Petroleum Price Products Survey, which was published by the Energy and Transport Directorate General of the European Commission.  The latest survey, which relates to retail prices on 1 December, states that retail prices are higher in Ireland than in most other EU member states.  However, concerns have been raised about the methods used by member states to collect the price information on which the survey is based.  These concerns are shared by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, whose Department is responsible for forwarding this country's price information to the Commission.  The Commission is aware of the need for greater transparency in the reporting and presentation of oil price statistics across member states.  In October, the Commission issued a comprehensive questionnaire to member states to survey the collection of prices published in its weekly bulletin.  The purpose of the survey was to assess the methods of collection used by member states with a view to harmonising price reporting and removing reporting discrepancies between member states.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is actively engaging with the Commission to ensure that the shared aim of more transparent reporting can be achieved.  An illustration of the difficulties with the Commission's current system of reporting retail prices is the fact that the Commission's latest survey shows that the average retail price of petrol in Ireland on 1 December was €1.156 per litre, whereas the average price according to a number of domestic fuel information websites is only €1.02 per litre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1978">The Deputy may be aware that following widespread concerns earlier this year that the benefits of the decline in the wholesale price of oil were not being passed on to consumers, I asked the National Consumer Agency to undertake a survey into the underlying reasons pump prices for petrol and diesel had not fallen in line with the drop in the wholesale price of oil.  As part of its work, the agency is benchmarking movements in prices in Ireland against those in other EU countries.  It is examining the frequency and the timeliness with which changes in the wholesale price are being passed on to consumers.  The agency has been conducting surveys of retail prices throughout the country.  It is engaging in a series of meetings and contacts with, <i>inter alia</i>, the main distributors and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  While the average retail price of petrol and diesel is just over €1 per litre, which represents a considerable reduction from the much higher prices of the summer, it is particularly important in these difficult economic times to ensure that the benefits of the dramatic decline in wholesale fuel prices are passed onto consumers and businesses to the greatest extent possible.  It was for this reason that I asked the National Consumer Agency to undertake a survey on this matter.  I look forward to receiving the agency’s report, which I understand will be finalised in the coming weeks.</p>

In the year that followed the trade mission of January 2007, which was led by the then Taoiseach, Irish merchandise exports to the UAE increased by 34%.  This healthy trend has been maintained for the first seven months of this year, with an increase of 23% on the same period last year.  In addition, exports of services are strong and growing rapidly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1985">Because of the solid prospects for continued growth, this trade mission was undertaken to build on the success that has already been achieved.  Some 88 companies and organisations took part in the mission.  I officiated at a wide range of events to promote the efforts of the participating companies, to strengthen relationships with key contacts in the UAE market and to raise the profile of Ireland as a source of quality innovative goods and services.  I met two Government Ministers to discuss a range of issues, relating to specific State projects of interest to Irish companies, and to develop wider political contacts and build on existing strong levels of Irish-UAE co-operation at official level.  During the mission, 32 contracts and agreements were signed by Irish businesses from a variety of sectors, particularly construction, engineering, architecture, software and financial services.  The value of the contracts and agreements signed was €40 million.  I am confident that the work undertaken on the trade mission will lead to the further expansion of Irish exports to the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_1987">Data from the CSO quarterly industrial survey shows that average industrial earnings per hour for male industrial workers on adult rates in June 2007 was €16.62.  The average rate for female industrial workers was €12.73.  The CSO National Employment Survey for October 2006 showed that average hourly earnings were €20.50 for males and €17.67 for females.  The latter figures cover the entire economy in October 2006, excluding employees in agriculture, forestry and fishing.  The gender pay gap has fallen consistently and is now below the EU average of 15%.  The most recent official figures from EUROSTAT, which relate to 2006, put the Irish gender pay gap at 9%, placing us fourth lowest among the 27 member states.  This compares with a rate of 14% in 2003, showing a drop of 5% in three years.  However, EUROSTAT acknowledges that the data are provisional and therefore may not be wholly comparable between member states.  Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is a multifaceted task involving a number of Departments and agencies as outlined in the National Women's Strategy 2007-2016, which was launched last year by the Taoiseach.  The overall co-ordination of the strategy is led by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">The introduction of the national minimum wage in 2000 has had a positive impact on women who were previously more likely to receive very low wages in sectors which were predominantly female.  My Department is responsible for chairing and providing the secretariat for the national framework committee on work-life balance policies.  The committee, which was established under the social partnership process, comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and a number of Departments.  The committee has undertaken and continues to undertake a range of activities to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work-life balance at enterprise level, including the provision of financial assistance to organisations, information dissemination activities, seminars and research, etc.  These activities may help to encourage greater female participation in the workforce, including at senior levels which in turn can help to narrow the earnings gap.  Similarly, Expanding the Workforce, which is run by FÁS, is aimed at proactively encouraging women to return to work.  The initiative facilitates women returnees by ensuring that training is provided in a flexible manner and is tailored to meet business requirements and skills needs of employers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1990">Given the significant reduction we have witnessed in construction related activity this year it is no surprise that we have also witnessed a similar reduction in the total number of apprentices registered with FÁS and the number of new apprentice registrations this year. However, as apprenticeship is a demand driven education and training programme for employed people it is clear that employers play a key role in ensuring that they recruit apprentices now in order to meet their future skills requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1991">Recent Government forecasts for construction activity indicate that there will be a sharp decline in employment in the construction sector and particularly in new house building in 2008 and 2009. However, these forecasts also indicate that a sharp recovery of 6% is projected for construction output and employment from 2010 onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1992">Based on these forecasts it is important that we continue to train apprentices in order to avoid potential skills shortages in future years. It takes at least four years to fully train an apprentice. Therefore, it would be prudent for those employers that are in a position to do so, to take a longer-term view if they are to take full advantage of the upturn in construction sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1993">For its part the Government has over recent years invested significant resources in developing our apprenticeship system to create capacity to meet the needs of industry.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1995">Forecasting employment figures is a perilous business at the best of times, and never more so than in the current economic climate we now find ourselves subject to. As one of the most globalised economies in the world, the uncertainty created by the ongoing international financial crisis and the consequent fall in demand for goods and services both domestically and worldwide has had a significant impact on our economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1996">The Government and I share the concerns of all at the levels of unemployment; however, it must be viewed in the context of historically unprecedented numbers of people in work. Since 1997, over half a million new jobs have been created in Ireland and the number in employment still exceeds 2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1997">The following table shows that in the period 2002–2007 over 150,000 new full time permanent jobs were created in companies supported by the enterprise development agencies (IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development). Of this total, 84,619 new jobs were created in the manufacturing sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1998">These figures do not take account of the new jobs created with the support of the Government through Udarás na Gaeltachta, which falls within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1999">The economic environment is more challenging than we have seen for many years; however, we have the foundations in place for long term economic growth through proactive policies such as the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation, the National Skills Strategy and the National Development Plan. Ireland is well placed to tackle the challenges we are facing, with a strong base of modern industry, a highly skilled and flexible workforce and a pro-business culture. We continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&amp;D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, in line with the NDP and the Programme for Government</p>
            <p eId="para_2000">In the competitive arena of enticing foreign direct investment (FDI), Ireland still manages to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment. While costs are higher, we have responded by positioning ourselves as a location for more advanced activities, with more qualified and better paying jobs. The pipeline of new business for which IDA Ireland is competing is strong and we remain confident that Ireland is well placed to secure significant investment during the remainder of 2008 and beyond, from key target sectors such as Pharmaceuticals, Biopharma, Medical Technologies and Information and Communications Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_2001">Competition, both for investment and goods and services in the global economic environment that Irish business functions in, is keener than ever. Innovation, and the productivity gains that flow from it, are the new foundations for competitiveness. In order to sustain and grow the manufacturing sector, Irish based manufacturing enterprises will have to continue the progression to high value added sectors and activities, and continue to increase productivity through investments in human capital, technology and innovation. Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability that are technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2040">I am fully conscious of the need for vigilance against the exploitation of vulnerable workers, including migrant workers.  It is important to bear in mind that migrant workers can and do obtain the full benefits and protection of Irish labour law.  Naturally, unscrupulous employers may try to take advantage of those in a vulnerable position.  However, the Government will not stand aside while employers try to gain unfair competitive advantage by short-changing workers on their entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2041">Our extensive and comprehensive body of employment rights legislation is the foundation for our protection of vulnerable workers, including migrants and includes: Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996; The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997; National Minimum Wage Act, 2000; Payment of Wages Act, 1991.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">We also have a Code of Practice on engagement of domestic staff in private houses.  The code was introduced in May, 2007 and emphasises that employees in other people's homes have an equal entitlement to the employment rights and protections available to any other employee.  It highlights a number of these rights and includes provisions relating to protections that have particular relevance to these employers and employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2043">The Employment Law Compliance Bill, 2008 will further strengthen the protective framework.  The Bill, which is on the Order Paper of the Dáil, is being finalised at present in consultation with stakeholders and I have asked my Department to ensure that the second stage will be taken early in the next Parliamentary term.</p>
            <p eId="para_2044">As well as having a strong legislative foundation, we have highly effective Industrial Relations machinery through which to process claims by employees with grievances including the Rights Commissioners, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2045">In addition, we have strengthened inspection and enforcement.  The recent media coverage to which the Deputy refers was a timely reminder of why the Government set up the National Employment Rights Authority  (NERA) as a key outcome of the Social Partnership process.  The issues that have been highlighted are disturbing.  However, these issues are not unknown to us  — in over 20,000 workplace inspections this year, NERA has determined an average breach rate of 21%.  NERA has had considerable success since it started operations in 2007 in ensuring that abuses of workers rights and entitlements will not go unchecked.</p>
            <p eId="para_2046">NERA Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the Inspection Services seek redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. In the year to the end of November, some €2.34 million in arrears was recovered on behalf of employees. 70 cases have, in the year to date, been referred to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">NERA's 2008 inspection programme featured targeted campaigns focusing on areas including security, catering and agriculture.  In addition campaigns were carried out to check compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act and the Protection of Young Persons Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">With the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007, which came into operation on 30th March, 2007, NERA inspectors now undertake joint investigations and engage in information exchange with officers of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2049">The effective promulgation of employment rights information is also a prerequisite to compliance.  No matter how efficient an inspectorate we have, not every case of exploitation will be caught.  That is why one of the best defences we have against abuse of workers is good quality information and ease of access to redress — both of which will empower the individual vulnerable worker to take the matter further.  Information and good communication of worker's rights is a key element of Employment Rights Compliance.  Great emphasis is put on this by NERA, which reproduces its Employment Rights information in twelve languages and has 80 labour inspectors currently active who are skilled in foreign languages.  These efforts are complemented greatly by the contribution that is made by the Social Partners — both Trade Unions and Employers — as well as the established Employment Rights bodies to greater awareness of responsibilities and rights in the workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_2050">I urge anyone who has evidence of contraventions of employment rights legislation to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to NERA's Inspection Services with a view to pursuing the matter.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
            <p eId="para_2088">The role of the 35 County and City Enterprise Boards is to provide support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level throughout the country.  The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2089">The forms of CEB direct financial assistance which are available to small businesses, subject to certain restrictions, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study Grants.  The criteria under which financial assistance is available is based primarily on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size, or proposed size, of the enterprise.  The enterprise must be in the commercial sphere, must demonstrate a market for the proposed product/service, must have a capacity for growth and new job creation and must not employ more than 10 people. The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and the CEBs must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">The provision of non-financial assistance which CEBs can offer can take the form of a wide range of business advice and information services, management capability training and development programmes, e-Commerce training initiatives, mentoring services and the delivery of targeted Programmes to promote female entrepreneurship.  In common with the other enterprise agencies which operate under the aegis of my Department the CEBs also provide general advice and guidance on a range of developmental matters relevant to small businesses such as mentoring, business training and business advice all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.  I would suggest therefore that the person concerned should, in the first instance, make direct contact with their local CEB and explore what level of assistance, if any, may be available to them. Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website; www.enterpriseboards.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">The Government has also made very considerable progress on the implementation of the Small Business Forum Report's recommendations.  This progress is reflected through a substantial package of financial measures and Schemes introduced to assist the small business sector over the last two years, including fiscal measures in the 2007 and 2008 Finance Acts.  These measures were designed to help all small and medium sized businesses across the country and include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">the extension and radical improvement of the Business Expansion and Seed Capital Schemes up to 2013;</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">important increases in the VAT Cash Accounting — now €1m and VAT Registration Turnover Thresholds — now €75,000 have been introduced in order to simplify administration and reduce working capital requirements on small businesses;</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">changes to the preliminary tax obligations of certain companies so that small companies are now permitted to calculate their preliminary tax payments based on 100% of the prior-period tax liability if their tax liability for the prior period did not exceed a certain threshold — now €200,000;</p>
            <p eId="para_2095">new companies, which do not expect their tax liability for the first year to exceed €200,000, are no longer obliged to pay preliminary tax in that first year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">The 2009 Budget in October announced tax relief measures for start up businesses by way of remission in Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax in the first 3 years for new and start-up businesses.  These measures will help to grow small business and promote an entrepreneurial culture.</p>

            <p eId="para_2098">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners the number of used motor vehicles imported in 2007 and to date in 2008 are as shown in the following table.  The weakening of Sterling against the Euro has been a contributory factor in the increase in used car imports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">Revenue currently carries out a risk based examination of a proportion of the used imported vehicles being presented for registration i.e. examining all high-risk (determined by age and value) passenger cars and in addition, some 10% of all other vehicles are examined.  The examination ensures that the documentation matches the car being imported, the condition of the car is as stated and that any extras on the car have been declared for VRT purposes.  An Interagency Working Group set up to examine issues related to the management of the national fleet from registration to end of life has identified and examined a number of concerns in relation to vehicles using our roads.  The Deputy may be aware that I have brought forward proposals in the Finance Bill to assist in addressing this issue, by tightening the rules in relation to the registration of second hand vehicles.  I believe these measures will improve the regulatory framework in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2304">The new VAT arrangements for tour operators being introduced under the Finance Bill arise from an Appeal Commissioners' decision which made all tour operators liable to VAT. Any deferral of the proposed measures would mean that the normal VAT rules would apply creating difficulties and inequity of treatment whereby domestic and in-bound tour operators providing holidays in Ireland would pay VAT, while out-bound tour operators would not be obliged to pay VAT, but would still be entitled to recover VAT on their inputs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">The measures under the Finance Bill will ensure equity of treatment for tour operators and will bring their VAT treatment into line with most other EU Member States by introducing what is called a Margin Scheme. Under the Margin Scheme, Irish tour operators will have to account for VAT on the profit margin realised on the supply of a travel package.  Inward tour operators established outside of the EU will not be subject to VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2306">The commencement of the Margin Scheme on 1 January 2010 is considered to provide ample opportunity for tour operators to prepare for the changes being made. My officials will be consulting with the sector in order to ensure a smooth implementation and operation of the new arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_2308">As I announced in the Budget, the Government has reviewed the Decentralisation Programme in light of the changed economic circumstances and identified priority elements on which implementation should proceed at this time.  The Government's decision will result in the relocation of approximately 6,000 posts to over 40 locations outside of Dublin in the current phase of the programme.  This is made up of 2,600 posts already moved, together with an additional 3,400 posts which are in train. Decisions on the timing of further work on implementation of the balance of the programme are being deferred pending a review in 2011 in light of budgetary developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2309">The total amount of expenditure by the OPW under the Government's Decentralisation Programme to date in relation to the property aspects of the programme is approximately €270m. This includes the cost of site/property acquisitions, fit-out works and rent paid to date. Details submitted to my Department indicate that a further €2.73m has been expended by FÁS in respect of the acquisition of property in Birr, €2.5m was expended by the Health and Safety Authority in respect of the acquisition of property Kilkenny/Thomastown and approximately €305,000 has been expended by Pobal in respect of its premises at Clifden.</p>
            <p eId="para_2310">The costs to date have been offset by property disposals in Dublin. Total income from property disposed of in Dublin between January 2004 and December 2007 was €355.9m.  In addition, property valued at €75 million was transferred to the Affordable Homes Partnership.  The OPW has also agreed joint venture redevelopment schemes with a minimum value of circa €125m up to the end of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2311">At end June 2008, the total non-property costs incurred amounted to approximately €12m.</p>

            <p eId="para_2317">The deterioration in the economy's competitiveness relative to that of our main trading partners has been driven by a combination of factors. These include a strong euro, wage increases in excess of productivity, and the relatively high rate of inflation that we have experienced in recent years. While CPI inflation has eased in recent months and may temporarily turn negative during the course of next year, it is important to note the level of prices here stands at more than 20% above the euro area average. Improving our competitive position is essential to facilitate a re-balancing of the economy towards more sustainable, export-led growth and to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a location for inward investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2318">In recognition of this, and notwithstanding the need to underpin the sustainability of the public finances, the Government took a number of steps in Budget 2009 aimed at supporting the economy's competitiveness. These included re-affirming our commitment to the 12.5% rate of corporation tax and maintaining and enhancing pro-employment business tax reliefs. We are also continuing to prioritise productivity enhancing capital investment. These measures will ensure that the Irish economy is well placed to take advantage of the global pick-up when it emerges.</p>
            <p eId="para_2319">The pursuit of national competitiveness is not, however, solely for Government. Rather it is a shared responsibility of all in society including the social partners — Government, employers and unions. Regaining our competitive position, which as a small open economy is critical to our economic success, will require each of us to play our part and work together to this end.</p>
            <p eId="para_2320">A key aspect of this will be to ensure sensible wage developments over the coming years. In this regard, the willingness of the various parties to adopt a realistic approach to wage developments will be required to ensure that we address the changed economic circumstances which we now face. In addition, it will be important to ensure that improvements in external factors that favourably impact on domestic costs are passed on in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_2322">The main domestic reason for the current economic slowdown is the adjustment in the new house building sector, which is exerting a major drag on overall GDP growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_2323">For a number of years up to 2007, the annual number of house completions exceeded the estimated medium term requirement.  While this very high level of output was a response to very strong demand, it was never expected to be sustained into the longer term.  Unfortunately, the downward adjustment towards more sustainable levels of output has occurred much more rapidly than previously envisaged with the level of output undershooting medium term sustainable levels for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2324">One of the reasons behind this very rapid turnaround has been the sharp decline in demand which, in turn, reflects an erosion of confidence brought on by the deterioration in global financial markets and the global downturn more generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2325">The effects of the adjustment in house building have spread to other sectors of the economy and Government finances have not been immune either.  We now need to re-focus our efforts towards enhancing competitiveness in order to promote economic growth based on exporting goods and services to the wider global economy.  Otherwise we will not be well placed to benefit from a future resumption in world growth.</p>

            <p eId="para_2328">I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 136 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2329">The guarantee Scheme for financial institutions put in place by the Government has been successful in safeguarding the stability of the Irish banking sector and in restoring its liquidity position in order to support its normal lending activities. The Scheme is intended to provide a detailed framework for the positive and constructive changes that must flow from this to restore and uphold for the future the traditional banking values of responsible and balanced risk-taking and lending in order to underpin the long-term sustainability of the banking system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2330">Financial institutions, particularly those participating in the guarantee Scheme, have a key role to play in supporting both individuals and businesses in the current challenging economic and financial environment.  As I made clear when presenting the Guarantee Scheme to the Oireachtas in mid-October, the boards and senior executives of the participating institutions have a key role to play in ensuring that the finance is channelled appropriately to support and underpin sustainable economic activities on a prudent and responsible basis which is clearly in the interest of both the bank, the borrower and wider economy.  The Deputy will be aware that at recent meetings with certain financial institutions I asked them to consider the contribution that they can make to the economy through appropriate credit initiatives in relation to small and medium sized businesses and otherwise.  Subsequently certain institutions have already announced new initiatives to help the SME sectors.  I welcome these important announcements and look forward to further dialogue on this important issue in the coming days and weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2331">The regulation of lending practices of Irish financial institutions is the statutory responsibility of the Financial Regulator. In addition to what is contained in the guarantee Scheme, the Financial Regulator has instigated a series of new regulatory measures to take account of the changed financial environment, including an increased focus on the management of credit and liquidity risks of the banks. Among the actions the Financial Regulator is taking are the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2332">the immediate recruitment of an additional 20 senior supervisory staff with banking experience to be placed on-site in key banks to monitor developments;</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">requiring banks to set out new business plans focusing on the need to reduce their risk profile and how their models of banking are sustainable in the new environment; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">enhanced reporting obligations in relation to capital, asset quality and individual large loans to supplement daily liquidity reporting requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">Work has begun at an international level on forging a new model to govern the conduct and behaviour of the financial sector. Ireland will play its part internationally and particularly at EU level in seeking to ensure that the re-design of the financial system and in particular of financial regulation is consistent with the objectives highlighted in the Guarantee Scheme.  For the future, it is important to focus on the objective of effective regulation of financial services within the common EU framework under which the regulatory system in Ireland operates and on how best to achieve the integrated and more intensified approach which will help maintain financial stability and safeguard the interests of all consumers of financial services.</p>

            <p eId="para_2346">The legislative regime for financial regulation In Ireland is largely based on a comprehensive EU framework of Directives which applies across the EU. Arising from the recent financial turmoil, the Ecofin Council meetings in October and December 2007 agreed a set of common principles and a roadmap of further actions to enhance financial stability arrangements and the ability of authorities to respond to serious disturbances in EU financial markets. These Ecofin Roadmaps deal specifically with strengthening EU arrangements for financial stability and actions taken in response to the financial turmoil. New regulatory requirements include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2347">improvements to the Capital Requirements Directive to further strengthen the existing prudential framework for risk management and to put in place enhanced coordination among supervisors in relation to cross-border groups</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">improved valuation of illiquid assets in accounting standards for financial institutions</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">amendments to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive to improve coverage levels and payout periods; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">proposals to improve the oversight of independent credit rating agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">The role and mandates of national regulators have been the subject of in-depth consideration by the Ecofin Council arising from the Ecofin Roadmaps. Common reporting for financial institutions are being introduced to enable greater EU-wide consistency in supervision and colleges of supervisors are being introduced for cross-border financial groups to allow for easier exchange of information between authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">These measures are in addition to the broad range of conditions imposed on participants in the State's guarantee scheme for credit institutions. The Regulatory Authority, which has statutory responsibility for the regulation of credit institutions, has advised me that it will continue to intensify its on-site and off-site supervision of credit institutions. This will build on revised capital and liquidity measures introduced by the Regulatory Authority during 2006 and 2007. The Regulatory Authority will focus on liquidity requirements, capital adequacy, risk management, balance sheet structure and corporate governance. This may involve setting additional regulatory ratios as appropriate in order to reduce the risk in the balance sheet, reflecting the current domestic and global conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2355">I have met with the CEOs of the six major financial institutions covered by the Guarantee Scheme on a number of occasions.  My focus in those meetings has been to secure a stable and active banking sector which services the needs of the Irish economy.  I am satisfied that the discussions have been productive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2356">I announced on the 28th of November that in certain circumstances it would be appropriate for the State to consider supplementing private investment in the banks. Discussions on this are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, I have asked those institutions covered by the Government's Guarantee Scheme to consider the contribution that they can make to the economy through appropriate credit initiatives in relation to small and medium sized businesses and otherwise.  I have, therefore, welcomed the fact that certain institutions are already considering or have announced initiatives in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2358">The Scheme also provides that each of the covered institutions conducts its affairs in a manner that progressively reduces the risk to the Exchequer under its guarantee, for example, by putting in place improved structures to ensure the long-term stability of funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">I understand that the Financial Regulator is instigating a series of new regulatory measures to take account of the new environment and to deal with the challenges it faces.  These measures include, establishing a new unit within the Banking Supervision Department which will be dedicated to the supervision of the institutions covered by the Scheme, transferring existing resources and expertise and recruiting additional staff with banking experience into the Unit, which will be headed by an experienced Head of Function.  The Regulatory Authority has requested and received detailed business plans from six of the covered institutions and has commenced a series of engagements with the institutions at the most senior level in order to determine the soundness of the plans.</p>

            <p eId="para_2361">Problems in global financial markets are already having a significant impact on the Irish economy.  For instance, difficulties in international financial markets are the main reason why the pace of demand in our major trading partners has slowed, with many experiencing periods of contracting economic activity.  This poor international economic climate is adversely impacting on our export performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">There is no doubt that Ireland is in a period of contracting activity this year and next.  However, to be able to assess the full impact on the Irish economy would require knowledge of when the global market will pick up and when developments in international financial markets achieve stability.  Unfortunately, these cannot be projected with any degree of accuracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2363">Through the introduction of the Bank Guarantee Scheme the Government have sought to maintain an environment where the financial markets can continue to function normally and banks can continue to support economic activity through their lending policies.  I welcome the fact that many of these institutions have already announced funding schemes aimed at meeting the needs of the SME sector and I will keep this important area of economic activity under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_2403">The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible, in an effective and efficient way.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.  It is essential that we prioritise patient safety and quality and that we organise and manage services accordingly.  The priority is to provide safe services as close as possible to where people live.</p>
            <p eId="para_2404">In the past, Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital Ballinasloe have operated independently, with two consultant general surgeons in each hospital.  The difficulties faced by Roscommon and Portiuncula in maintaining surgical services independently, and the need for closer co-operation between them, were highlighted by the former Comhairle na nOspidéal in March 2006.  Advances in clinical care and ever-increasing levels of specialisation mean that the present model of care faces important practical difficulties, which must be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">In the light of these factors, the best way of retaining and developing services at Roscommon and Portiuncula hospitals is for these hospitals to work closely together.  The Health Service Executive has advised that it is proceeding with the proposal for a Joint Department of Surgery and Anaesthesia at Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2406">My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the detailed information sought provided directly to the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2460">The High Level Group on Traveller Issues is a working group under the Senior Officials' Group on Social Inclusion which, in turn, reports to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, Children and Integration, chaired by the Taoiseach.  The High Level Group, as established in 2003,  provided a forum for senior policy makers and service providers to discuss barriers to service delivery and explore possibilities of approaching service delivery in a more integrated way.  In this regard, the Group was considered as an extension of the Strategic Management Initiative process, an attempt to join up service delivery and to ensure that intended service outcomes for Travellers under the various sectoral strategies were achieved.  The Report of the High Level Group was published in March 2006 following approval by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">The High Level Group is now involved in implementing, for example,  one of its key recommendations, namely, development of an integrated approach to service delivery at local level using the structures of the City and County Development Boards. Traveller Interagency Groups have since been established in each CDB area and the High Level Group Report specifies meaningful consultation with local Travellers as an essential element in developing the integrated approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_2462">While Travellers are not included in membership of the High Level Group they continue to be  included in a number of national consultative fora and are closely involved in a range of  discussions on policy development. I would draw the Deputy's attention in particular to the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee (NTMAC), which was established following a commitment from all of the social partners, contained  in Towards 2016, to give "concentrated attention" to achieving progress on Traveller issues. The NTMAC includes a greater representation from the Traveller Community than it's predecessor, the Traveller Monitoring Committee, which reported on the implementation of the 1995 Task Force Report.  Prominent Traveller individuals from different parts of the country are included in the NTMAC. The committee has a specific remit to advise on policy in relation to the Traveller Community and I look forward to it's first report, which is due in 2009.</p>

          <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_755">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2468">I have been advised by an Garda Síochána that Operation ‘Snow' is an initiative undertaken by the Garda National Immigration Bureau which is designed to prevent the trafficking and smuggling of minors into, out of and within the State; to ensure the welfare of suspected victims of such criminal activity is adequately provided for; and to achieve prosecutions where criminal activity of the nature concerned has been detected. This commencement of this initiative coincided with Ireland's commitment to a European G6 Human-Trafficking Initiative which involves an undertaking of a period of enhanced law enforcement relating to human trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_2469">As part of this initiative the Garda National Immigration Bureau has encouraged increased vigilance by members of An Garda Síochána who are engaged in the immigration process, in particular with regard to the movement of minors into and out of the State, in an effort to discover children who may be victims of human trafficking or smuggling of illegal immigrants. In doing so it is recognised that discovering a child who is the victim of human trafficking at the time she/he enters the State may represent his / her only opportunity to avoid the exploitation the traffickers involved have planned for him or her.</p>
            <p eId="para_2470">Enforcing the relevant provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991 in respect of minors arriving in the State at ports of entry, has proved to be particularly important in offering protection to minors suspected to be victims of human trafficking or smuggling of illegal immigrants.</p>
            <p eId="para_2471">To date, since the commencement of this initiative in 2007, almost 200 incidents have been subject of investigation, with assistance provided for a total of 164 children, although many of these cases have not transpired or are not expected to be related to trafficking.</p>
            <p eId="para_2472">The Garda National Immigration Bureau has, on numerous occasions, had cause to place unaccompanied minors in the care of the Health Service Executive, through invoking the provisions of the Child Care Acts, following their arrival at ports of entry to the State, and at Dublin Airport in particular.  Such incidents are followed up by investigations undertaken for the purpose of establishing if human trafficking or smuggling, or other criminal acts, have been committed by persons involved in arranging the arrival of the unaccompanied minors concerned into the State. A significant number of these investigations have revealed family reunification and other immigration related reasons as the explanation for suspicious activity regarding non-Irish national minors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2473">This initiative forms part of the strategy of an Garda Síochána targeting those suspected of being trafficked for the purpose of exploitation (sexual or labour), whether minor or adult, and is performed in the course of ordinary duties undertaken by all members of An Garda Síochána who are tasked with enforcing legislation, in particular immigration-related legislation. No specific budget-head is allocated to this type of duty or this initiative in particular.</p>
            <p eId="para_2474">One of the most significant detections to date under this initiative involved the holder of a Ghanaian passport, who presented at Garda National Immigration Bureau Headquarters for the purpose of being entered on a register of non-nationals maintained by the Garda Síochána in accordance with the provisions of Immigration Act, 2004. Records indicated that this person was wanted, on foot of a European Arrest Warrant, which had been issued by the Dutch Authorities, on suspicion of involvement in the trafficking of minors. He was arrested and was subsequently removed to the Netherlands, where he is due to stand trial for his alleged involvement in the trafficking of unaccompanied minors, who are Nigerian nationals, into the Netherlands and other European countries, for the purpose of their sexual exploitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2475">The most recent incident detected under this initiative relates to a female who was intercepted by Immigration Officers at Dublin Airport in November, 2008. The woman, who was accompanied by three  children, had commenced her journey to Ireland in Nairobi. While the woman indicated that she was the mother of these children, the immigration officer concerned was not satisfied that she was in fact the mother of the children concerned, causing him to make appropriate inquiries, which resulted in her being arrested on suspicion of having breached the provisions of section 2(1), Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000. She was subsequently charged with three breaches of section 2(1), and was brought before Dublin District Court, where she pleaded guilty. The woman was dealt with pursuant to the provisions of Probation of Offenders Act, having undertaken to leave the jurisdiction and not return.   The three children concerned were placed in the care of the Health Service Executive, pursuant to the provisions of section 8(5) Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) and thereupon the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991 applied to them.</p>

The Agreement will allow for the continuation of visits to Ireland on the existing basis. This follows months of detailed discussions between the two Governments and is a very positive outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_2480">In all my contacts with the Belorussian authorities on this matter, most recently in conversation with the Belorussian Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, on 28 November, I have repeatedly stressed the importance of ensuring that visits by the children over the forthcoming Christmas period can take place. I am very pleased that this has also been agreed.</p>

        <b>Deputy Joan Burton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
         her views on what the main policy interventions by Government were which were responsible for the significant reduction in consistent child poverty as reported in the European Union survey on income and living conditions 2007 published on 10 December 2007 from 100,000 in 2006 to 75,000 in 2007.

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_763">
            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2536">Combating poverty and building an inclusive society are key priorities for the Government. The overall goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion), is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty, including children, to between 2% and 4 % by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_2537">The latest poverty statistics released last week by the CSO in its annual EU-Survey on Income and living conditions showed that the overall consistent poverty rate reduced from 6.5% in 2006 to 5.1% in 2007. The rate of consistent poverty in the case of children aged 0-17 reduced from 10.3% in 2006 to 7.4% in 2007. A high proportion of children in poverty live in lone parent households. There was a significant reduction in consistent poverty rates for lone parents in 2007 from 33.9% to 20.1%. The results also revealed that the average disposable income in respect of children increased by 16.2% between 2006 and 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2538">The survey covers the period during which the provisions of Budget 2007, which introduced a range of measures costing over €240 million aimed at alleviating child poverty, came into effect. These measures clearly had a major impact on the outcomes achieved in relation to the reduction in child poverty. They included:</p>
            <p eId="para_2539">Combining the three rates of Child Dependant Allowance payments into a new single high rate Qualified Child Allowance of €22 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2540">Increasing the rate of Child Benefit by €10 per week to bring the rates of payment to €160 for the first and second child and €195 for the third and subsequent child.</p>
            <p eId="para_2541">Increasing the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance by €60 for children aged 2 to 11, and by €95 for children aged 12 to 22, to bring the rates of payment to €180 and €285 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_2542">Providing additional funding of €3 million to extend the School Meals Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2543">Other budgetary measures, which came into effect during 2007, such as the €20 per week increase in the lowest social welfare rate to €185.80 and increases in the earnings thresholds for One Parent Family Payment and Family Income Supplement, also indirectly benefited children living in poorer households. This package of measures was in addition to initiatives such as the €1,000 a year early childcare supplement, which was introduced in 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2544">One of the most effective routes out of poverty for people in the active age groups, many of whom are parents, is through paid employment. People with families who are in lower paid employment are eligible to receive the family income supplement which increases household income while enabling recipients remain in, or take up, employment. Currently the weekly average payment for a one child family on FIS is approximately €99. Child benefit, which has been increased substantially in recent years, also facilitates employment take up, as a significant portion of child-related income is paid to people returning to work or already in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">Employment participation is further facilitated and incentivised by a range of education and employment supports made available by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to people in receipt of welfare payments, particularly the long-term unemployed, lone parents, and sickness related welfare recipients. These include the Back to Education and Back to Work Allowance Schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2546">The Activation and Family Support Programme and the Second Chance Education Opportunities Scheme offer supports to social welfare customers and others to help them to improve their employability and personal and family situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">In spite of the current economic difficulties, the Government is determined to maintain the significant progress being made in reducing child poverty, especially through improved income support for children and their families and through removing obstacles to and providing incentives for employment take up. The recent budget provided for a range of measures costing over €56 million to benefit children and families. These include an increase of €2 in the qualified child increase payable with social welfare payments, bringing the rate up to €26 per week from January 2009; an increase of €10 per week per child in all family income supplement income thresholds, giving an increase of up to €6 per child per week from January 2009; and an increase of €50 per week in the income threshold for the back to school clothing and footwear scheme to enable more families qualify. These increases will mean that the high level goal of maintaining the combined value of child income support measures at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult social welfare payment rate will continue to be met next year (These range between 33.4% and 43.7%).</p>
            <p eId="para_2548">In framing budget 2009, the Government has prioritised delivering real increases in social welfare payments to ensure that, in line with the NAPinclusion, the most vulnerable groups in our society are protected. Increases of between 3% and 3.8% in the basic payment rates have been provided for next year, ahead of the projected rate of inflation for 2009 of 2.5%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2549">The significant reduction in consistent poverty among children in 2007 show that the combination of policies being pursued is working. The Government's priority is to maintain that progress, and its determination to do so is demonstrated in the recent budget measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_2553">The focus of the bonus has always been on persons who rely on the social welfare system for financial support over the long term.

            <p eId="para_2554">There are no plans at present to amend or extend entitlement to the bonus payment to short-term schemes, and any such extension could only be considered in a budgetary context having regard to the resources available and the significant cost which would be involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_3389">Section 72 of the Roads Act 1993 confers powers on local authorities to make by-laws governing the use of skips on public roads including the requirement to obtain a permit from the local authority when siting a skip on a public road. The local authority may attach various conditions to the permit including conditions relating to the siting and removal of skips, the dimensions and other characteristics of skips, the lighting and marking of skips for the purpose of making them readily visible to road users, the care and disposal of the contents of skips, the earliest practicable removal of skips once full and the clear and indelible marking of skips with the name, address and telephone number of the owner or provider.</p>
            <p eId="para_3390">Enforcement of these conditions is a matter for the relevant local authority. Skip bags have become increasingly popular with the public as an alternative to the more traditional skip and particularly in circumstances where there is not enough waste to justify hiring a full-sized skip but too much for the regular household collection. Skip bags are distributed through a network of retailers and are collected by a permitted waste collection company.</p>

            <p eId="para_3399">Since the enactment of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, each local authority has adopted two successive Traveller Accommodation Programmes. In the course of the first programmes, covering the four-year period 2000 to 2004, some 1,371 additional Traveller families were provided with permanent, secure accommodation. Over the same period, there was a 50% reduction in the number of families living on unauthorised sites, down from 1,207 families at the start of the programmes to 601 families at their completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3400">Significant progress is being made nationally under the second Traveller accommodation programmes, covering the four-year period 2005 to 2008. Some 1,156 additional units of new and improved accommodation have been provided for Traveller families up to the end of 2007.  Expenditure under the second programmes up to end November 2008 exceeds €134 million. I will be asking the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee to report, as early as possible in 2009, on the progress made over the full period of the second programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3401">Local authorities are currently preparing the third round of Traveller accommodation programmes, which will cover the five-year period 2009-2013. In accordance with the legislative requirements, these programmes are to be adopted by 30 April 2009 at the latest.</p>

            <p eId="para_3403">As stated in the reply to Question No 220 of 26 November, in general, following consideration by the Board, the rates charged to local authority borrowers are normally adjusted by the Board of the Housing Finance Agency (HFA) in line with movements in European Central Bank (ECB) rates. However, given that the correlation between ECB rates and interbank rates (i.e. the rates at which the Agency itself borrows) is atypical and volatile at present,  the Agency, in responding to movements in ECB rates, must give careful consideration, on each occasion, to the fluctuating relationship between its lending rates and the cost of funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_3404">While it is hoped that it will be possible to pass on the most recent rate reduction announced by the ECB, it will be necessary to monitor the impact of the cut on interbank rates before a decision can be made. I anticipate that, in common with the situation following the previous two cuts in October and November, which are being passed on in full to local authority borrowers, the position in relation to possible movement in the HFA's lending rates should be clear within a number of weeks of the ECB announcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3405">In the meantime, rates charged to local authority borrowers continue to offer very good value by comparison to rates charged by commercial lenders, and over the course of 2008 the local authority rate has been almost 0.6% lower than the market average variable rate.</p>

            <p eId="para_3424">The prohibition on religious advertising does not prevent advertisements, which provide information about a religious magazine or periodical being available for sale, or about a religious event or ceremony taking place.

            <p eId="para_3425">The Deputy will be aware that in 2004, the prohibition on religious advertising on radio and television was retained following a lengthy consultation during which over 150 submissions from the public were received by my Department.

The provision focuses on advertisements that address the issue of the merits or otherwise of adhering to any religious faith or belief or of becoming a member of any religion or religious organisation, as opposed to the existing restriction which relates to advertisements directed towards a religious end.  The section also continues the clarification that permits advertisements which provide information about a religious magazine or periodical being available for sale, or about a religious event or ceremony taking place.</p>

            <p eId="para_3433">As outlined in a previous reply to the Deputy the person named submitted an application under Category B of the 2008 National Reserve.  This category caters for new entrants to farming after 31 December 2005.  A New Entrant is defined as a farmer who did not, pursue any agricultural activity in his/her own name or at his/her own risk in the five years immediately preceding the commencement of the new agricultural activity.

However it was not possible to apply the National Reserve allocation due to the above-mentioned issues with regard to a Dual Claim.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3453">The Advisory Committee on Traveller Education was established in July 1998, arising from one of the recommendations of the 1995 Report of the Task Force on  the Travelling Community.  Its terms of reference were to "advise the Minister  of Education and Science on the provision of education services for the people  of the Travelling community."</p>
            <p eId="para_3454">Membership of the committee was drawn from the main stakeholders in Traveller  education including representatives of the Departments of Education and Science  and Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as representatives of the  Education Partners and of the main Traveller Representative bodies and the  Travelling Community.</p>
            <p eId="para_3455">In November 2003, a Joint Working Group, consisting of members of the Advisory  Committee on Traveller Education, the Educational Disadvantage Committee and  three of the principal national Traveller organisations was established to  provide recommendations for a new Traveller Education Strategy. The last  meeting of the ACTE was in October 2005, when it considered the draft Report of  the Joint Working Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_3456">The Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy was launched  in November 2006. The recommendations contained in the report are intended to  address the Educational needs of Travellers from pre-school through to further  and higher education. My Department established an internal working group to  oversee the implementation of the recommendations. The severe educational  challenges faced by young Traveller children is recognised and although it is  too early to predict the outcomes attributable to the changes which the  strategy will bring, there is already some evidence of improvement in school  attendance, transfer from primary to post primary and completion of upper  second level.</p>
            <p eId="para_3457">While it is of immeasurable importance, access to education is only one of the  serious challenges faced by the Traveller Community. Issues including health,  housing, equality, policing and social welfare dependency are also critical to  improve conditions of and participation by the Traveller Community in Irish  society. In this context the establishment of the National Traveller Monitoring  and Advisory Committee (NTMAC) in March 2007 was a very welcome and important  development. The NTMAC involves all relevant stakeholders with representation  from central and local government, the Traveller Community, Traveller  Representative Bodies, Social Partners and the Health Services. The NTMAC is a  forum which provides an opportunity, at a very high level, to develop and  enhance consultation and collaboration with all stakeholders on the full range  of issues, including education, rather than adopting a fragmented approach to  consultation. On its establishment the NTMAC appointed a number of  sub-committees to consider and consult upon a range of key issues facing  Travellers. Central to the terms of reference of one of these sub-committees  was the role of education. The sub-committee concluded its work in June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3458">The strategy which is at an early phase of its implementation has been fully  consulted and agreed by stakeholders. At present my department is consulting  with the NTMAC on the merits of establishing a new consultative forum which  might provide opportunities to engage with relevant stakeholders to review  progress and evaluate outcomes after the strategy has embedded. In the meantime  my Department will continue to play a full part in the work of NTMAC and its  committees.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3460">In recent years my Department has taken significant steps in improving the  educational outcomes for Traveller Children. Recent reports indicate that  transfer from primary to post primary is almost at 100%.  The number of  Traveller students participating at post primary level has grown from fewer  than 100 in 1988 to some 2,500 this year. Notwithstanding these developments, I  recognise that there is much room for improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3461">The Report and Recommendations for a Traveller Education Strategy was launched  by my colleague Minister Mary Hanafin T.D. in November 2006. The Report covers  all aspects of Traveller Education from pre-school right through to further and  higher education within a lifelong learning context. The primary aim of the  Strategy is to ensure a quality, integrated education for Travellers  underpinned by the principles of inclusion and mainstreaming with an emphasis  on equality and diversity and the adoption of an intercultural approach. This  is in line with the Government's recommendations in the National Action Plan  Against Racism (NAPAR) (2005).</p>
            <p eId="para_3462">The principle of inclusion is at the core of the current strategy and future  provision will focus on the development of more inclusive and intercultural  school practice and environment through the whole school planning process,  admissions policies, codes of behaviour and whole school evaluation. A key aim  of the strategy is to enhance access and education service delivery to  Travellers. Future provision will focus on ‘individual educational need' rather  than ‘Traveller identity'</p>
            <p eId="para_3463">Education is a key element in supporting greater Traveller participation and  empowerment in our society. The link between education, training and enterprise  is perhaps the most vital in helping to increase the range of life choices that  are available to Travellers. A lifelong learning approach will focus on the  journey from Pre-school to Primary, Post-Primary and on to employment or  further education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_3464">At present my Department spends some €65m directly on Traveller education from  pre-school through primary, post primary and further and higher education.  Direct supports include some 503 resource teachers at primary level, 42  Visiting teachers and additional teaching hours at post primary level.  In  addition to this some 651 personnel are deployed in schools serving  disadvantaged communities under the School Completion Programme and the Home  School Community Liaison Service to address the needs of children and young  persons who are at risk of leaving school early by providing a range of  in-school and out of school supports and by engaging with the salient adults in  the lives of these children. My Department is working to ensure that all of  these services, where they are available in schools, will prioritise those  children, including Traveller children, who are at risk of early school  leaving.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3467">I propose to take Questions Nos. 210 and 211 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3468">I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be  made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other  areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. I fully accept that  these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they can only be  justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the  country. I have called for co-operation from all the education partners in  meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a  country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3469">The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day  announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3470">My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing and grant allocations. The preparatory work for this has  commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from  schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools  will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate  mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them  under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers  my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs  and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of  the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3471">I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally  the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools  for the 2009/10 school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have  been completed. Furthermore the staffing schedule will be published and it is a  transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and  fairly and know where they stand.</p>
            <p eId="para_3472">At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to  it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner. Diverting resources in  order to create staffing or funding profiles for the individual schools  requested by the Deputy, information which at this time could only be  speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3473">I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3475">As you will be aware, the Education budget for 2009 has been increased by some €302 million. Notwithstanding this, a number of tough and difficult decisions  have had to be taken, which have seen a number of spending cuts across the  education sector. However, the overall allocation for the School Completion  Programme in 2009 will increase by approximately 1% over the allocation for  2007/08.</p>
            <p eId="para_3476">My Department notified all 124 school completion projects on 21st August last  that, pursuant to a Government decision in response to the deterioration in  public finances, they would be required to reduce their payroll bill by 3% in  2009 through all appropriate measures identified by local management in the  light of local circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3477">In line with the requirements set out in the letter dated 21st August, Projects  are requested to submit the required establishment plans including information  on the numbers of existing staff, both full-time and part-time at all salary  levels in each project. Under the terms of the Government decision, the  allocation for the pay element of the School Completion Programme in 2009 will  be framed on the basis that a saving of 3% will be achieved when the pay bill  is adjusted to include the full-year cost of Towards 2016 increases payable in  2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3478">Projects were advised that they have the authority to manage how the savings  are to be achieved. This is to facilitate projects in their efforts to ensure  that these necessary steps will be applied in such a manner as to minimise  their effect on young people targeted and to prioritise those activities which  are found to be of most value in supporting the young people concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3479">In implementing this decision local Management Committees will have an  opportunity to consider measures which might include the control of premium  pay, the management of existing or future vacancies, the organisation of work  processes and the levels at which work is carried out, as well as control of  numbers through recruitment and other measures. This requirement will not have  a universal effect on all 124 projects, as projects vary in size, number of  schools involved and the number and status of personnel employed and the types  of interventions in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_3480">It is envisaged that the savings requested, will lead to rationalisation, with  more efficient and cost effective measures being implemented. In this way, it  is not expected that there will be any significant diminution of front-line  services.</p>

            <p eId="para_3486">The 2009 budget allocation for youth services is €48.2m, a decrease of 8% on  the 2008 figure. The reduced allocation in the youth budget will require much  tighter budget management and prioritisation which may impact on pay and  administration costs. Department officials have met with representatives of the  youth sector to ascertain the sector's views on how best to minimise the impact  of budgetary constraints next year with a view to consolidating, in so far as  is practicable, the progress made in recent years.  In trying to minimise the  effects of these budgetary constraints, the determination of the 2009  allocations under the various schemes needs careful consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_3487">I wish to assure the Deputy that very effort will be made to notify the various  youth work organisations and administering agencies of their allocations at the  earliest possible time in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_3489">The compulsory nature of Geography in Voluntary Secondary schools is historical  in origin and relates back to the time when it was compulsory in the  Intermediate Certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3490">While Science is an optional subject for the Junior Certificate, uptake has  been consistently very high, with 87% of the entire junior cycle cohort sitting  the examination in the Junior Certificate. 91% sat Geography in the 2008 Junior  Certificate examination.</p>
            <p eId="para_3491">There are no plans to make science compulsory at junior cycle given the  importance of curricular choice in ensuring that students have access to a  balanced range of options in keeping with their interests and abilities. It is  considered more important that as many students as possible should be motivated  to remain in school to completion of upper second level education, and  curricular relevance and choice have a key role to play in this.</p>

            <p eId="para_3496">The Office of Public Works (OPW) is responsible for the provision of office  accommodation on behalf of the Department and meets all related rent/lease  costs.  OPW have allocated the following Galway city offices to my Department: 1. Office of the Inspectorate, Ross House, Merchants Road, Galway. The area of  the office is 402.72 sq. metres and the rent in 2007 was €81,282.25. 2. The Western Regional Office and NEPS Western Regional Office share offices  in Victoria Place, Eyre Square, Galway.  The total area here is 701.4 sq.  metres and the rent in 2007 was €180,000.  NEPS hold 450.16 sq. metres and the  Western Regional Office has 214.07 sq. metres.</p>
            <p eId="para_3497">The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) rents 37.17 sq. metres of  office accommodation in Victoria Place,  Eyre Square , Galway for which they  paid €9,540 to OPW in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3498">I am not aware of any other aegis body arrangements in relation of office  rental in Galway city and consider this a matter for the individual agencies  concerned.  If the Deputy has any particular aegis body in mind I would be more  than happy to have my officials obtain the relevant details and communicate  them to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_3500">I announced last Thursday that proposals had been made to my Department by the  second-level management bodies identifying annual savings of €16 million within  the supervision and substitution scheme.  These savings can be made not only in  the current year but on a continuing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3501">The proposals involve replacing heretofore demand-led availability of cover for  uncertified sick leave and official school business, costing €21 million per  annum, with an allocated or budgeted scheme costing €5 million per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_3502">On the basis of these proposals and discussions between the management bodies  and my Department, I outlined that I am making available €2.7 million to  second-level schools for the remainder of this school year.  This will provide each school with a limited number of hours of substitution  cover outside of the supervision  and substitution scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3503">There will also be a full review of the substitution and supervision scheme in  conjunction with the school management bodies and teacher unions during this  school year with a view to making up this additional €2.7 million expenditure  and thereby ensuring that the budgetary parameters are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_3504">The implementation of the proposals made by the second-level management bodies  will, over the balance of the current school year, provide a new basis for  managing the use of substitution cover for school business and enable schools  manage unpredictable teacher absences due to uncertified sick leave.</p>

            <p eId="para_3506">I am aware of the concerns raised by the school referred to by the Deputy.  However we are dealing with an economic situation of unprecedented difficulty.  The Government has a collective duty to respond to this and to take very  difficult decisions in the national interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_3507">In doing this we have attempted to afford some shelter to the education sector  but given the scale of public expenditure on education it is simply not  possible to avoid tough decisions. I fully accept that these decisions are not  of themselves desirable and that they can only be justified by the imperative  of securing the future economic stability of the country. I have called for  co-operation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing  us both as an education community and as a country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3508">The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day  announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a  significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3509">When the country was able to afford it we reduced the basis on which primary  teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of  primary pupils per teacher from 35 pupils in 1995/96 down to the current level  of 27 pupils. This is reflected in the improvements that we have made on class  sizes over the years and these improvements reflect our commitment to  education.  The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher from September  2009 has to be viewed in that context. Although it reverses some of the  progress that we have made in recent years I had no option but to curtail the  annual increase in teacher numbers. The reduced class sizes for the most  disadvantaged in our DEIS schools of an average of 1 teacher for every 20  pupils in Junior classes and an average of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils in  Senior classes will not be changing in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3510">While the budget measures will impact on class sizes it will be necessary in  the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and  prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone. While teacher numbers  are important numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that  teacher quality is the single most important factor — far and above anything  else — in improving educational outcomes for children. Ensuring high quality  teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit it  represent a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and  indeed the teacher unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3511">I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_3516">I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 to 223, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3517">Language support teachers are appointed to assist schools in providing  additional English language support for pupils for whom English is a second  language.</p>
            <p eId="para_3518">There are currently 554 Language Support Teachers allocated to post- primary  schools, at a current cost of approximately €35 million per annum. The number  of teaching posts in each second-level sector is broken down as follows: 288 in  voluntary secondary, 88 in community and comprehensive and 178 in VEC schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3519">The table gives a breakdown of the number of Whole Time Equivalents (WTE)  currently allocated to second-level schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3520">The budget measures announced recently will mean that the level of language  support will be reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a  maximum of two teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3521">As I announced on budget day we will provide for some alleviation for the  position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of  newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on  a case by case basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3522">At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to  it is to carry out the allocation process for 2009/10 in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for individual schools  or list of schools could not be justified and would actually impede this  process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3523">Moreover, OECD research in this field (PISA 2006) shows that Ireland is the  OECD country with the highest distribution of newcomers across schools meaning  that schools with higher concentrations of newcomer children are relatively  unusual. ESRI data also shows that only a small percentage of schools have high  concentrations of newcomer children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3524">I realise that standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching  resources and that the quality of the supports that the child receives and the  inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing  the quality of learning achieved by migrant children. My Department recognises  that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided  to migrant students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our  provision. The Department is undertaking a range of research to consider the  question of integration in schools and how best to deploy our resources to  ensure that all the children in our schools can benefit from learning in an  intercultural Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3525">My Department is providing support and training for teachers of English as an  additional language in the current school year. At post primary level, the  Second Level Support Service (SLSS) have identified members of their team to  provide training and support for teachers of English as an additional language.  The training has been designed and will be rolled out in early 2009. The table gives a breakdown of the number of Whole Time Equivalent (WTE)  currently allocated to second-level schools:</p>
