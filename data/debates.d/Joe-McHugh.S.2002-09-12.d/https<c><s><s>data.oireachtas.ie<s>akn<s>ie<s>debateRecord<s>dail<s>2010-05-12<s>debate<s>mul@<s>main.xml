        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">First, I should congratulate the new British Prime Minister, David Cameron, and his deputy, Nick Clegg, on forming a government in Britain and I wish them the best of luck in their onerous duties.  I pay tribute to the departed Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, particularly for his interest in Northern Ireland and for the work he did there.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">For years, Deputy Bruton, in particular, has pointed out the lack of clarity, discussion and debate about the way we prepare budgets in Ireland and that the entire system is a charade where government does its business internally, the budget is presented and there is little analysis or discussion beforehand and no prioritisation of the allocation of money.  It is a failure of the House over the years because of Government control that budgets are presented in the nonsensical way they have been presented for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I note that this morning the Minister for Finance gave instructions to Ministers to find within their Departments contributions that will amount to €3 billion of cuts in the economy for presentation in the budget later this year.  I also note reports that the European Commission is to publish legislation, which will essentially mean foreign ministers for finance will have first sight of the Irish budget before it is discussed in the House.  This would amount to handing over sovereignty and the running of our country to somebody else.  Does the Taoiseach agree with this proposition that is being put forward?  Has he signed up to this?  Is he of a mind to continue in the traditional way where no discussion takes place on the budget beforehand?  Is he also of a mind to sign up to a proposal like this, which would be contrary to the Lisbon treaty that many people fought hard for and which would amount essentially to the handing over of sovereignty of the Irish State and the running of Irish affairs to peer groups, depending on their political whim, within the Council at any time?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I wish the former British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, well.  As I said in my statement yesterday evening, he was a good friend of Ireland who showed a strong commitment to the implementation of the agreements of which both his government and ours were co-guarantors and I wish him and his wife and family well for the future.  I thank him for his excellent work in many respects.  In our dealings with him, we found him to be an excellent colleague to work with.  I wish Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg well in the formation of a new government and I look forward to meeting the British Prime Minister in due course to build on the good relationships that successive governments have been able to establish between the Irish and British Administrations in recent times in the hope that we can continue to co-operate and work together on items of common interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">With regard to the matter raised by Deputy Kenny, today's media comments on the EU proposals to improve budgetary policy co-ordination are not based on published EU documents.  I do not want to comment further on the specifics of articles in the press.  Ireland has laid out a multiannual plan with budgetary targets for the coming years.  The plan is to reduce the general government balance to below 3% of GDP by 2014 and it has been welcomed and approved by the EU Commission.  Much has been achieved on the public finances as a result of decisive Government action since this issue first arose.  We have stabilised the deficit with decisive actions.  It would have ballooned to 20% of GDP had we not taken the actions we took since coming into office.  Fiscal discipline is an important factor in bringing growth and, ultimately, jobs back into the economy and the prospect of a net increase in job creation is based on us continuing with the multiannual plan that has been implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">That is the reply of a desperate man who is throwing bait that he expects somebody to rise to but I will not do that.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, was Minister for Finance and he is now Head of Government.  He has brought our country to an excessive deficit position through gross mismanagement of our economy and a complete inability to have the courage to debate issues in the House, particularly in regard to the presentation of budgets as they affect the running of our country and impact on ordinary people every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Article 136 of the Lisbon treaty sets out clearly that in certain circumstances the Council may adopt procedures on the surveillance of budgetary issues in any country within the eurozone.  The Commission's proposal is quite opaque and it means the political whim, colour or bias of the Council at any time could influence what is being talked about here.  I want an assurance from Deputy Cowen as Head of Government and Taoiseach of this country that in no circumstances will the Government hand over sovereignty of the running of our economy to anybody else who might have a different view.  For example, other countries might well be jealous of our low rate of corporation tax which we have all agreed we would maintain and which is directly related to a specific element within the Lisbon treaty.  I do not want a situation where others would look at the Irish budgetary preparation before it is ever discussed by Oireachtas na hÉireann and that they would say, for instance, that we would have to make changes in public pay or corporation tax, or adjust matters that might not be to our liking.  I seek confirmation from the Taoiseach that, first, he is not going to sign up to something that will hand over our authority to bureaucrats elsewhere and that he is clear about the retention of sovereignty and control over our own economic affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Last year, Fine Gael put forward the view that we should set up an independent fiscal advisory council in the Oireachtas where the Government would discuss the preparations for the budget——</p>

          <p eId="para_48">First, I join the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny in paying tribute to Gordon Brown and thanking him for the work, in particular, that he has done in regard to this country and Northern Ireland.  I wish Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg well as they embark on the leadership of the Government of Britain.  Relations between Britain and Ireland greatly improved under the outgoing Labour Government, especially in terms of matters relating to Northern Ireland.  It is important that there is a good working relationship between the Government and the British Government.  I hope that will continue under the new regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">We have been talking about the deficit.  I wish to refer to the one thing that has contributed, and is contributing most, to the deficit in this country, namely, the continuing story of Anglo Irish Bank.  That is the black hole that Fianna Fáil helped to dig and into which €22 billion of taxpayers' money will now have to be put, adding to our national debt.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach about an article in <i>The Sunday Times</i> which refers to a set of confidential, internal minutes from a meeting at Anglo Irish Bank dated 18 February 2009 between Anglo Irish Bank and the Central Bank.  Reference is made to the fact that the Department of Finance told the then chairman of Anglo Irish Bank not to be too negative in a letter to shareholders relating to the bank’s 2008 annual report which was published after the bank was nationalised in early 2009.  According to the article, the then chairman, Mr. O’Connor, was also told by the Department of Finance that he should not refer to emergency funding.  It is indicated in the article that Mr. O’Connor was anxious that the chairman’s statement should tell it as it is.  The article, astonishingly, states that the Department of Finance drafted a less negative version of the chairman’s statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">The Taoiseach will recall that, when we heard some weeks ago that Anglo Irish Bank had increased the salaries of some of its staff, both Deputy Kenny and I asked him about that in the House.  He told us there was nothing he could do about it because it was all a matter for Anglo Irish Bank and its board and that the Government would not or could not intervene or interfere in the matter.  Yet, according to the article, there was a direct interference by Government, through the Department of Finance in which, in effect, the Government was encouraging the chairman of the board of the bank to doctor the information being released to the public and not to share with the bank's shareholders — there is some responsibility on the boards of banks to inform shareholders, as they were in 2008 — the real state of the bank's finances.  According to the article, the Government was directing the bank to put a gloss on the information being issued as part of the 2008 annual report, and it even went so far as to draft a less negative letter to go with the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">While the Government had intended that somehow the cost would be at arm's length from the State's own finances and budgets, that cannot now be the case due to what we heard from EUROSTAT.  Therefore this is a very major issue.  The Minister for Finance only told this House the full extent of the requirement for finance of this bank in April this year.  What was the state of the Government's information about the requirement from Anglo Irish Bank for additional funding in February 2009 when the Government directed the bank to doctor the information that was being issued to the public?  That is the first question.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The Taoiseach has not addressed the second question, but made it sound as if the bank just sent in the draft statement from the chairman for observation.  According to this article, the Department of Finance redrafted the statement.  It drafted what it calls a "less negative version".  Is that true or not, because it seems to be a serious matter?  If there was a gloss put on the information that was put out, this is serious, but it is doubly serious if that was done at the instigation of Government through the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Can the Taoiseach square these developments with the relationship framework, which I understand the European Union requires to have established between the State and Anglo Irish Bank as a condition for approving the arrangements arrived at for that bank?  A reply was given to Deputy Burton by the Minister for Finance only a couple of days ago, in which he stated that in the interests of facilitating compliance with EU state aid and competition policy, the relationship framework recognises the separation of Anglo Irish Bank from the Minister and limits intervention by the Minister in the conduct of the bank's day to day commercial activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">What does the Taoiseach believe the European Commission is going to think of this report in <i>The</i>
                        <i>Sunday Times</i>, which he has not denied, that states the Government had a hands-on approach in writing what in fact turns out to be a false statement on the financial position of the bank?</p>

            <p eId="para_85">The cost of the communications unit in February was approximately €20,189.  The projected cost for the unit in 2010 is €242,269 with €112,220 being a direct cost to my Department and the balance being paid by three other Departments which have staff seconded to the unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">The projected cost for 2010 represents a reduction of 6% on the 2009 cost, 20% on the 2008 cost and 27% on the 2007 cost.  This has been achieved through greater efficiency in the operation of the unit and the application of Government policy on reducing staff numbers.</p>

            <p eId="para_88">We have raised these questions on previous occasions.  As I understand it, the Departments were to cease contracts for independent news monitoring services on a daily basis.  From looking at the costs, can the Taoiseach confirm this has actually happened and that the communications unit now supplies all the news monitoring information to Departments, thereby creating a saving overall?</p>

            <p eId="para_89">There are Departments which use external media monitoring services for newspapers and specialist magazines dealing with their particular areas of activity.  They use these services for media notifications specific to their Departments.  External services are sometimes used for the provision of transcripts where these cannot be obtained from the communications unit because of time constraints and in instances of high demand.  The communications unit furnishes news updates and transcripts from the national media only, which ensure that Departments are kept informed of relevant news developments in a fast and efficient manner.  The unit does not have the capacity or resources to provide regional news items and press cuttings, however, to individual Departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">I take the Taoiseach's point about national newspapers and national news.  Last week CIE announced that the DART underground project would be delayed until 2018.  This was because of planning delays, even though a planning application has not been lodged.  Somebody forgot to tell the Minister for Transport, however.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">Will the Taoiseach say whether the communications unit monitors announcements from State agencies and if so, does it send them on to Ministers directly?  How could a situation such as this arise, where the delay until 2018 of a  major infrastructure project is announced by CIE and the Minister for Transport is not informed?  Is it a case of the communications unit missing this important piece of information or is it because the State agency does not inform it in the first place, in order for the message to be transmitted to the Minister concerned?  Is the communications unit supposed to be on top of this type of situation?</p>
            <p eId="para_92">There was a situation in Shannon a couple of years ago where the Secretary General  did not inform the Minister of another issue, as regards Aer Lingus taking away slots, which caused some controversy.  Can we take it, then, that State agencies are monitored by the communications unit?  In the event, why was the Minister for Transport not informed in this case?</p>

It would be a matter for the relevant Ministers to consider any recommendations emanating from these reports and to bring forward proposals to respond to them, as appropriate. I should point out, however, that two of them were interim reports, surveying current practice in this and other jurisdictions, and did not put forward any recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">The Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, Deputy O'Rourke, recently called on the Government to hold a referendum.  She also revealed that the Minister of State with responsibility for children has a budget of €3 million to hold that referendum.  She confirmed that the wording was agreed and she presumed, as Chairman, that it would be accepted by Government.  That was on 30 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">In confirming that €3 million is available and has been assigned to the Minister of State for the holding of this referendum, can the Taoiseach give us some clarification on whether it is intended to hold it in 2010?  It is a matter that affects a large number of people, and the need for a referendum has been agreed, after a great deal of work, by the all-party Oireachtas committee.  The proposed wording should be inserted into our Constitution by a decision of the people.  I support this strongly.  The Government should now be in a position to say it will hold the referendum at a date to be fixed in 2010 so that those involved can begin to focus on their task, which is to ensure people are as well informed as possible so they can make their decision when they are asked to vote on the referendum.</p>
            <p eId="para_105">The Minister of State has a budget of €3 million.  The all-party committee has agreed the wording of the amendment and the Chairman of the committee presumes the Government will accept that wording.  Could we now have a statement from the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government to the effect that when the Minister of State comes back to the Cabinet, he will make a decision to hold this referendum some time in 2010?</p>

            <p eId="para_106">As I have said a number of times, the committee issued three reports in this regard.  The first of these recommended that the Government establish a statutory scheme for Garda vetting to regulate the collation, exchange and employment of hard and soft information for the purpose of child protection and to require that all persons working with children be subject to vetting.  In conjunction with the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, the Minister of State with responsibility for children is working on the preparation of legislation to establish a national vetting bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">The second report dealt with absolute or strict liability in respect of sexual offences against or in connection with children.  It contained 39 recommendations in total, some of which were restatements of recommendations in the 2006 report of the Joint Committee on Child Protection in respect of criminal justice procedures.  Again, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, obtained Government approval in December 2009 to prepare the general scheme of a Bill to implement the recommendations of the joint committee, including the majority recommendations in cases in which there was no unanimity.  That Bill will deal with the issues of absolute and strict liability that arose in the context of the Supreme Court judgment in the CC case.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">The third report, which was published in February, dealt with the rights of children under the Constitution and the statute and case law concerning adoption, guardianship, care proceedings, custody and access to children, and included an alternative wording for a constitutional amendment.  The report is currently being considered at senior official level in relevant Departments prior to its consideration by Ministers; the Attorney General is also considering the legal and constitutional issues that arise.  The work is ongoing and after consideration by the Government, decisions can be taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_109">The Government does not seem to give issues relating to child protection a high priority.  The Ombudsman for Children pointed out in yesterday's report that the HSE has failed to properly implement child safety guidelines over the past decade, leaving children at risk of abuse.  The first of the reports to which the Taoiseach refers, which was published in September 2008, recommended legislation to deal with what was called soft information for child protection.  At the time that report was published, the idea was that the legislation would be introduced in the autumn of 2008.  We are now well into 2010 and, according to the Government's list of legislation, the heads of the Bill have not even been considered yet.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">The third report from the committee chaired by Deputy Mary O'Rourke, which was published in February of this year, recommends a referendum to enshrine the rights of children in the Constitution and contains an agreed wording for the referendum.  All expectation had been that the referendum would take place in 2010, but the Taoiseach does not yet appear to be in a position to state whether it will take place this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">We have been kicking the issue of a referendum back and forth with the Taoiseach for a number of weeks.  Will there or will there not be a referendum on the rights of children, based on the recommendation of the all-party committee, in 2010?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_87">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_112">I do not agree with the Deputy that the Government does not place a high importance on these matters.  Under a previous Administration we set up the Office of the Minister for Children, which has been a welcome development and has resulted in many improvements in the administration of this area.  The Office has brought together disparate activities that traditionally had been associated with different Departments, which was seen as one of the reasons a legislative framework was not established as quickly as we would like.  There have been reports from Oireachtas committees considering these matters, and they are being acted upon in that Bills are being prepared.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">These are not simple issues.  The first report recommended the establishment of a statutory scheme for vetting and dealt with the question of hard and soft information, as well as recommending that persons working with children should be subject to vetting.  These are involved issues which relate to endangerment and the risk of sexual exploitation or abuse of children.  They are important matters and we are committed to introducing legislation that will provide a statutory basis for the vetting of persons to identify those who are suitable to work with children and vulnerable adults.  As I said, we hope to see the general scheme of a Bill submitted to the Government at the earliest possible date.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">As I said, the preparation of the general scheme of a Bill dealing with the recommendations in the second report was approved by the Government in December.  The Government is in no way neutral or indifferent to these matters.  The reason they have been dealt with at such length and in such depth by joint committees is precisely the complexity of the issues involved and the need to find a solution which will meet the objectives without causing other problems to arise as a result.  We must make sure these measures are effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">I have been clear about the situation regarding the third report published in February, which dealt with the rights of children under the Constitution and the statute and case law concerning adoption, guardianship, care proceedings, custody and access to children.  These are important matters and they are currently being considered at senior official level in the relevant Departments prior to their consideration by Ministers; the Attorney General is also involved.  I have made it clear that as soon as that work is completed it can be considered by Government.  It is not the case that these issues are not being dealt with.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">I will stick with the issue of the referendum.  We have the report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, which contains a proposed wording for the constitutional amendment.  In these matters, the wording is the most difficult aspect, and much time and effort was put into this on an all-party basis.  The legislation to allow for a referendum is straightforward once the wording is agreed.  It is a standard Bill; we have had constitutional amendments here before.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">The wording has been agreed and the legislation is simple.  As Deputy Kenny has pointed out, money has been set aside to hold a referendum in 2010.  Will we have this referendum in 2010?  It is a simple question and the Taoiseach should be able to give a straight answer.</p>

            <p eId="para_118">I understand there is an agreed wording from the committee.  The advice the Government takes on these matters is from the Attorney General, who, as the Deputy knows, must be given an opportunity to provide such advice.  The various Departments must also consider the impact of the implementation of the comittee's recommendations.  The Government must be allowed that opportunity, because it is its responsibility to bring forward such legislation on the basis of approval by Government.  Constitutional amendments are not straightforward.</p>

            <p eId="para_119">Has the Government considered this at all yet?  The report was published in February.  When a referendum is being considered, there are normally just a couple of opportunities in the year for it to be held.  One of those is the beginning of June, which is what I expected.  I got the Dáil schedule from the Whips office earlier in the year and noticed there was a week at the beginning of June when there were to be no Dáil sittings.  I assumed and said to myself that would be the week we would have the children's rights referendum.  That would be the logical time to have it.  What is the Government's plan for having it or what is the position?  The political belief is that the Taoiseach is pulling back from holding a referendum on children's rights because he is afraid he will have to have the three by-elections on the same day, but the last thing he wants is an election of any sort.  It seems to me the Taoiseach is sacrificing the right of children here to have their rights written into the Constitution and refusing to have this referendum, which was agreed on an all-party basis, in order to save his political skin.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">I suppose there is a limit to the number of ways we can put this question to the Taoiseach.  Is the Government committed to holding a referendum on children's rights and is it committed to holding such a referendum in the current year?  The response we received from the Tánaiste here last Thursday was that the matter has not been finalised by the Government yet and the Taoiseach has stated this morning that the issue is currently being considered.  I asked the Taoiseach yesterday what was being considered.  Can we have a firm response this morning that the Government is committed to holding a referendum on children's rights this year and that the only matters being addressed are the sign-off, hopefully, on the wording recommended by all parties in the House, the drafting of the referendum Bill and the preparations for a referendum commission?  This consideration should not take a serious length of time, given the amount of work already invested in the committee's deliberations and the fact the Government parties were represented in that engagement and the current Minister with responsibility for children was an active attendee and participant for the greater part of the preparation and production of the third report of the committee recommending the referendum on children's rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">We have indicated to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste time and again that there is growing concern and understandable impatience with regard to this referendum, particularly given the seriousness and import of what is involved, the backdrop to the particular commendation from the committee, the various reports and the exposure of the dreadful events that have gone on over many years in a variety of settings.  These matters continue to threaten the safety of children in a variety of settings today.  We need to take the appropriate action to guarantee children's rights as an absolute imperative of the Constitution.  I urge the Taoiseach to be more forthcoming and to be crystal clear in affirming the Government's commitment to holding a referendum on children's rights in the current year.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">That unfortunate and trite reply will do nothing to assuage the fears of Deputies here and an ever-growing body of interested observers as to the Government's intent on the back of the committee's recommendations.  There can be no less awareness on the part of the Taoiseach than there is on ours that there is growing concern within non-governmental organisations dedicated to the service of children's rights and interests throughout the State.  There is an imperative on him and the Government to show clearly that they hold common intent and that they are absolutely committed to carrying out the recommendations of the committee.  That is not clear.  The Taoiseach refers us to the revised Government programme, but the last one was not worth the paper on which it was written.  Such a referral gives no assurance and does not assuage fears one iota.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">The Taoiseach has the opportunity this morning to state firmly the Government's intention to hold a referendum on children's rights in the current year.  We, with one voice across all the Opposition parties, ask him to do that.  The Taoiseach is not doing it, which of itself raises all the serious questions other Deputies and other voices outside the House are raising.  I will ask the question again for the last time.  Will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that the Government is committed to holding a referendum on children's rights and will he hold that referendum in 2010?</p>

If the Deputy wants a reply, he must wait for it, but there is nothing I can do about the fact my reply will never be satisfactory for him.  The facts of the matter are as I have outlined them to the Deputy.  If he wants to relegate the programme for Government in the way he did, by dismissing it out of hand, there is obviously nothing I can say to him to convince him — because he does not wish to be convinced — about what the position of the Government is.  I have referred the Deputy, if he wants to know what the political commitment is, to the programme for Government.  With regard to the work that is ongoing, I have explained to him what exactly the Government is doing on this matter.  It is a serious and important matter and work is proceeding.  The Attorney General's advice will, obviously, have to be considered by the Government in respect of all of that.</p>

            <p eId="para_139">Would the Taoiseach accept that there is widespread concern that the Government is merely paying lip service to children's rights and child protection?  Would he acknowledge that the concern is built on very solid foundations, given that not a single recommendation in the report of an all-party committee on child protection issues, which was published in autumn 2006, has been implemented?  The Office of the Minister for Children's review of the operation of the Children First child protection guidelines which was published at the end of July 2008 referred extensively to the failure to apply them uniformly across the State and to the reality that children who were at risk were not given the protection to which they were entitled.  The concern that the Government and the current and past Ministers of State with responsibility for children are only paying lip service to this issue was compounded by the report published by the Ombudsman for Children yesterday.  It quite astonishingly reveals that, following the review carried out by the Office of the Minister for Children which confirmed that the Children First child protection guidelines were not being implemented, a high level group within that Department which was established in 2008 to ensure application of the child protection guidelines did not meet on one occasion in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">Would the Taoiseach acknowledge that the ultimate condemnation of the current Minister of State with responsibility for children and the Minister for Health and Children, and their predecessors in Fianna Fáil-led Governments in this State since 2007, is the finding by the Ombudsman for Children of serious maladministration in the Office of the Minister for Children?  The report details quite clearly that over a period of eight years there was an utter failure to exercise the oversight the Department took upon itself to ensure the full and uniform application of the Children First guidelines.  Will the Taoiseach explain the reason for the maladministration or, in the diplomatic statutory language of the Ombudsman for Children, a failure that constitutes unsound administration under section 8 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002?  Will he explain why, during the period he was Minister for Finance and subsequently Taoiseach, there has been unsound administration, a failure to ensure uniform application of the child protection guidelines and, along the east coast under the old health boards and under the current HSE, there has been a cover-up of an industrial dispute with the IMPACT union which has resulted in instructions being issued to social workers not to apply fully the child protection guidelines?  Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that the delay in even acknowledging that a referendum on children's rights will take place this year absolutely confirms that the Government is doing nothing other than paying lip service and is prepared to sacrifice the welfare of children to cheap headlines and sound-bites in the daily newspapers?</p>

            <p eId="para_150">The Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs has overseen the development of revised Children First guidelines.  These latest guidelines take account of previous reviews and have been modified to incorporate feedback from the Ombudsman for Children.  They are now being printed and will be widely disseminated as part of the initiation of a comprehensive implementation process.  The new guidelines will be supported by a detailed implementation framework which will apply across all sectors and will include a particular emphasis on the need for systems of quality assurance and inspection to ensure that the guidelines are being properly implemented.  The ultimate aim must always be to ensure the protection and well-being of children who are being abused or at risk of being abused.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">Many of the actions outlined in the Government's implementation plan for the Ryan report will have a direct impact on the operation of child welfare and protection services and on many of the organisations, both voluntary and statutory, which have direct contact with the children.  The Government is committed to the implementation of this plan and €15 million is being made available this year for the implementation of these actions.  The implementation plan includes a commitment to draft legislation by December this year to introduce a statutory obligation on State bodies and others in receipt of public funding to comply with Children First.  This requirement, together with the detailed implementation framework for the revised Children First guidelines, will ensure that the weaknesses identified by the Ombudsman for Children are comprehensively addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">I welcome the fact that this report on an area of great importance has been published.  It sets out the findings of the Ombudsman for Children arising from an investigation into the implementation of the guidelines.  They have been in place since 1999 and were recently reviewed and revised by the Office of the Minister for Children.  We have a duty of care to try to alert everybody to the possibility of child abuse.  The report recognises that substantial efforts have been made since 1999 to implement the Children First guidelines, which were designed to strengthen existing child protection services.  It acknowledges that Children First is by far the most comprehensive and far-reaching document on child protection and welfare in the history of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">The report also highlights difficulties in the implementation of Children First and, in doing so, concurs with previous reviews, including a comprehensive review of the guidelines published in 2008 by the Office of the Minister for Children.  The Ombudsman for Children's investigation found that insufficient efforts were made by the health boards and the HSE to drive forward implementation of the guidelines and resolve problems arising——</p>

I understand there are currently 39,000 people who have lost their jobs who are waiting for redundancy payments as a result of the delays in processing the redundancy rebates.  Will the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation who has direct responsibility, take whatever action is necessary to speed up the processing of these claims?

There is a great degree of distress and anger among patients and relatives of those who are and have been resident at Loughloe House in Athlone, which has now been earmarked for closure by the HSE.  A HIQA report on this facility has not yet been published.  It recommends significant changes but, I believe, it does not recommend closure.  Is there not now a serious question as to how the HSE is utilising HIQA reports?  While this report has not been published, why would the HSE have announced a decision to close this facility, causing untold distress?  This is an issue for the Minister for Health and Children to make a direct intervention in order to establish what has given rise to the HSE's decision.  I urge the Taoiseach to take a personal interest in this case because there is a worrying indication that the HSE may very well be taking the decision in the context of cost-saving measures and not about patient safety, because HIQA is not recommending closure.</p>

First, as a result of all the recent hospital bed closures around the country, people have to wait even longer for service and lie on trolleys for even longer then they did hitherto.

Clearly, this will not be the case.  The message we get again is that legislation which may save only €20 million while hurting chronically ill and vulnerable people on medical cards will be taken first while the reference pricing for drugs Bill which could save the country badly needed hundreds of millions of euro is put on the long finger to be taken in the autumn or even later.

          <p eId="para_319">I wonder whether the Ceann Comhairle or the Taoiseach can help me with a matter.  I tabled a number of priority and oral questions today to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  They were disallowed on the basis that, following a number of announcements, FÁS has now been transferred wholly to the purvey of the Minister for Education and Skills by ministerial order.  I understand there will be primary legislation at a later date to transfer some of the functions to the Minister for Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">When I looked for this order, I could not find it.  It was signed by the Taoiseach.  It is called the Employment Programmes and Services and Skills Training (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order 2010.  It is a statutory instrument.  It does not have a number yet.  I understand it was signed on 27 March and came into effect on 1 May.  It was only lodged in the Oireachtas Library late last night.  It has not been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or the Order Paper and we cannot challenge it.  I do not understand how legislation can be made in this way or how the Taoiseach can sign an order of great importance on 27 March, have it come into effect on 1 May and allow for a situation almost two weeks later whereby it is not on the Order Paper or in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and only lodged in the Oireachtas Library last night.  We are not in a position to challenge this legislation but it was introduced two weeks ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Essentially, we have Government by decree and legislation by regulation.  This is no way to treat Parliament.  Essentially, we have a situation in which Ministers can sign orders and have them come into effect before they are even laid before the House and before we can challenge them.  I trust the Ceann Comhairle will not stand over this situation and I trust the Taoiseach will give some explanation as to why that is the case.</p>

Practical arrangements are being made to ensure these services are being provided and that reorganisation can take place in due course.  On advice, the Government made an order on 27 April to transfer all functions in respect of FÁS to the Minister for Education and Skills with effect from 1 May and since 2 May to the Minister for Education and Skills.  The purpose of this was to give the training and skills functions of FÁS to the Minister for Education and Skills.  Primary legislation will be required for the onward transfer of functions in respect of the employment services and community services programmes of FÁS to the Minister for Social Protection.  The issues are being dealt with on the ground.  As regards the question of the order and whether it was laid before the Oireachtas, I will check out the position.</p>

          <p eId="para_372">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  We all remember the shocking events of September 2008.  During the boom the banking culture, as we have now discovered, was out of control.  Money was thrown about like confetti at a wedding as financial institutions focused above all else on expanding their loan books.  I recall speaking to a couple some years ago who had sought a mortgage of €150,000 to build a house.  The financial institution they approached told them this would be insufficient and that they should borrow more.  When they insisted that they did not wish to borrow more than that sum they were advised that since they were getting married they should borrow more to cover wedding and honeymoon expenses and that the money for a new car could also be thrown in.  Fortunately, this couple were not tempted by the officer and borrowed only the €150,000 they had sought.  They are surely grateful now for their decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">I hold no brief for any banker who behaved irresponsibly.  I am appalled and disgusted by what was done, but I am confident that some of those who behaved in this manner will face the full rigours of the law in time.  I am also appalled and disgusted by the lack of effort on the part of the former Financial Regulator.  This was a man who seemed to sit on his hands; he saw nothing, he heard nothing and he certainly did nothing in terms of regulating the financial industry.  That is not acceptable.  The new regulator is perceived to be doing his job.  We on all sides of the House respect his independence and the public seems to approve of his performance.  I had the opportunity to meet him recently in regard to the Quinn Insurance situation.  While he did not tell me what I wanted to hear, I appreciated his frankness and independence.  He seems to be doing a very thorough job.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Better regulation is essential.  Banks cannot be allowed ever again to behave in such an irresponsible manner.  Before the boom we had a tradition where customers in local branches knew their bank managers and could speak to them about their financial situation.  When they applied for a loan they could be confident the manager's decision would be based on customers' banking history and their ability to meet repayments and other financial obligations into the future.  The financial situation of each individual was taken into consideration before a decision was made.  Unfortunately, that power was taken away from the local bank manager and replaced by decision makers in head office, faceless officials who were not acquainted with applicants' personal circumstances and did not properly take into consideration their ability to make repayments.  They did not have the best interests of customers at heart and that was a retrograde step.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">We must learn from the mistakes of the past.  None of wants to be here in ten years discussing similar episodes and recounting similar tales.  Banks have a duty to act responsibly and we all, as taxpayers, expect them to be responsible.  That is a legitimate expectation.  It is of paramount importance to us all that their activities are supervised.  If we do not have a properly functioning and regulated banking system, the State cannot function in an effective manner.  A flow of funds and trade credit is the lifeblood of an economy.  The Government has put capital requirements in place, set by the Financial Regulator, to ensure these mistakes are not repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">We have all been hearing that the Government has bailed out the banks.  I am sick, sore and tired of listening to that phrase.  We did not bail out the banks — we  bailed out the economy.  If we had not invested money in the banks, they would have gone under.  That was not an option.  We need a healthy functioning banking system for a healthy functioning economy, and we are attempting to achieve that.  It cannot come quickly enough, but unfortunately such things cannot happen overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Every Irish citizen who has money on deposit has a legitimate expectation and a right to feel that their deposits are safe.  If we had not put the bank guarantee system in place, many ordinary people who had worked hard and been careful with their money would have lost their savings.  We could not have allowed that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">A tale has been doing the rounds about a person who put their card in the bank machine, which told them there were insufficient funds.  The person wondered whether they or the bank had insufficient funds.  We could not countenance something like that happening in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Business people who run small, medium and large businesses are seriously concerned about getting credit and the lack of credit flow.  It is the lifeblood of those businesses and without it, many will go under.  I am not advocating the return of reckless lending practices.  However, where a business has a good trade and credit history, and is considered to be viable in the future, credit should be made available.  If we are to get out of recession, those businesses are crucial to our recovery.  We must give them the tools to allow them to carry on with their day-to-day activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I welcome the fact that the credit review process is in place.  People who feel that they were unfairly treated — who were refused credit or had it withdrawn — can request a review of and a determination on the bank's decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">I welcome the new powers in the Bill to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions.  That is hugely important.  The public, and we as public representatives, demand that it happens.  We have witnessed the results of irresponsible and incompetent behaviour by those at the top in our financial institutions.  It must never happen again.  The new powers will restore confidence in the management of our institutions, which is necessary on the domestic and the international fronts.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Before the financial crisis, we thought our regulatory structures were effective and appropriate.  How wrong we were.  The public is dismayed and disgusted by what went on, and I share those sentiments.  I am convinced that when the investigative work is complete, there will be prosecutions.  Those who were responsible, and who were reckless, will face the full rigours of the law.  I look forward to that day.  I hold no court or brief for anyone who has done wrong or behaved in that manner.  They should have their day in court, and explain and face the consequences of their actions — or in some cases, inaction.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">I welcome the accountability provisions for the Central Bank.  It will be required to submit a strategic plan to the Oireachtas once every three years, through the Minister for Finance.  That will specify the bank's objectives and how it plans to achieve them.  The Central Bank will be asked to present an annual statement to outline its internal audit function.  We should welcome those changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I agree with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that the Bill is urgent and essential.  It will enshrine in law the new structures that are necessary to ensure we have a properly regulated banking system.  I commend the Minister for Finance on his resolute determination to ensure there is confidence in our banking system at home and abroad, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
          <p eId="para_385">The central plank of the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 is to replace the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority with a new Central Bank Commission.  That commission will consist of the Governor of the Central Bank, the head of the Central Bank, the head of financial regulation, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and six to eight other members who will be appointed by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">My party's spokesperson on the subject, Deputy Richard Bruton, has already outlined his concerns on those proposals.  The European Central Bank has expressed concerns about the extent of ministerial influence.  The Secretary General is an <i>ex officio</i> member, and the head of the Central Bank and the head of financial regulation are to be appointed with the Minister’s consent.  The six to eight members will also be appointed by the Minister.  The ECB stated that the Minister’s influence over the Central Bank supervisory role will be increased and its operational independence endangered.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">This House has debated the need for openness and transparency in appointments, including those made by Ministers to relevant boards.  The structures the Bill sets out are important for the future regulation and control of banking and credit institutions.  It is an appropriate area in which to ensure we have transparent structures in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 is the first of three Bills.  It will be followed by a Bill to enhance our regulatory functions and an overarching consolidation Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">It is important that we look back, as many Members have, at where things went wrong and how we can ensure we do not have such lax regulation — to put it mildly — in future.  The Comptroller and Auditor General produced a report last December on the financial crisis and on regulation.  It quoted from the Financial Regulator's 2008 annual report, which referred to the factors that increased demand in the property sector.  One factor was the strong economic growth from 1995 to 2004, during which our GDP increased by 93%, which was four times the average increase in GDP throughout the EU during the same period.  The age structure of our population was a contributing factor — the percentage of people aged 25 to 54 increased from 35% in 1990 to 45% in 2005.  Interest rates in the EU were low at that time and the large number of property-based tax incentives — such as tax relief on mortgage interest and tax incentives for property investment — contributed to the increased demand for property.  The demand for housing supply continued to fuel the property market during that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The Financial Regulator was asked by the Comptroller and Auditor General what steps he had taken between 2004 and 2007 in response to the accelerating credit growth.  He said that in 2004, consumers were warned about the risk of debt, which included warnings about refinancing personal debts into mortgages.  In October 2005, new requirements were introduced for credit loss provisioning, including requirements for credit risk management.  In May 2006, capital requirements were increased on high loan-to-value mortgages.  In June 2006, new liquidity measures were introduced and they became effective in July 2007.  In August 2006, the consumer protection code was introduced to tackle aggressive lending.  In January 2007, discretions available to the Financial Regulator under the capital requirements directive relating to property were exercised by increasing the risk rating to 150% from 100% on exposure to speculative real estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Did the steps taken by the Financial Regulator succeed in dampening expectations or reducing the demand for capital given that banks ensured double-digit returns in their profits in the time in question?  Did it ensure banks met their financial commitments from their deposit base rather than through the purchase of bonds?  Did it ensure consumers would not be given 100% mortgages in an inflated housing market and that credit would not be obtained so easily?  Did it ensure banks would take greater account of their exposure to the property market?  I do not believe so.  We have seen all the signs of lax regulation.  Professor Honohan stated growth of 20% on the balance sheet of any bank should act as a trigger, yet Anglo Irish Bank had annual growth of 36% during eight of the nine years in question.  Foreign-owned operators in the Irish banking sector pursued aggressive growth levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">A cause of concern that should have been addressed was the high loan-to-value ratio with regard to mortgages.  In 2005 and 2006, two thirds of mortgages for first-time buyers were 90% mortgages while one third of applicants got 100% mortgages.  There was a negligible regulatory response in this period.  Against this background, it was probably refreshing and reassuring to have heard the new regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, say in his first public statement that we need to undertake a fundamental overhaul of our regulatory model for financial services in Ireland, including the setting up of a dedicated division to deal with enforcement with special investigative units established for the first time.  We all welcome this and other statements made by the Financial Regulator and we look forward to its new regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">There already has been a change to the regulatory approach to the covered institutions.  It involves a more on-site presence at each institution, increased reporting requirements for the institutions, improved reviewing and security regarding management information, a focus on the governance structures and processes and the establishment of a dedicated department within the Office of the Financial Regulator for supervising the covered institutions.  This will require finance, staff and more resources.  Mr. Elderfield has raised this matter in public.  Tomorrow he is due before the Committee of Public Accounts and I am sure he will be addressing this matter at that forum also.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The OECD agrees there were two main concerns over regulation and supervision.  It pointed to the issues associated with Anglo Irish Bank in respect of which the threat of enforcement was weak.  Regulatory structures should have been in place.  We need more structures because there was a culture of non-regulation and an expectation that the regulator would not visit financial institutions.  Enforcement was weak and there was no threat thereof in the period in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">We have heard criticism of the light-touch regulation that was in place.  It was a chosen policy of the Government.  Guidelines were recommended rather than rules enforced, and this had major negative consequences.  There was a failure to enforce strict rules and we are all dealing with the fallout now.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The Financial Regulator issued a consultation paper on corporate governance, which is to be welcomed.  It is aimed at addressing the inadequate oversight of the financial institutions, which is widely regarded as a cause of the financial crisis.  The paper requires that the number of directorships each director can hold be limited.  Directors spread themselves about and were not in a position to give their full attention to each demanding, onerous position that they held.  Further proposals are that membership of the board be reviewed every three years, that there be clear separation of the roles of chairman and CEO and that an individual who has been a CEO, director or senior manager of an institution during the previous five years be precluded from becoming chairman of that institution.  We all know where these recommendations have come from.  It is important that they be acted upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The role of the non-executive director needs to be defined clearly and minimum requirements for board committees should be set out.  The purpose of these recommendations are to prevent a recurrence of the circumstances that obtained when boards of some financial institutions acted as nothing other than a rubber stamp for decisions taken by chairmen or CEOs, who ran the institutions as personal fiefdoms.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Enforcement is very important.  New legislation designed to ensure a new system of regulation must have enforcement at its heart.  There is no point in having an improved set of rules if we are to undermine them through inadequate enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Many public representatives have received representations from constituents who are having difficulties with their banks.  They are running businesses and some of them have been in business for a long time and have been working with what they perceive to be performing loans.  Now, however, they find their banks are, to quote a constituent of mine, "putting the squeeze on them".  The constituent had a performing loan and he was working to repay it within the guidelines set down by the bank but the terms and conditions of the loan are now changing and the bank is demanding an increased return and shortening the term of the loan without prior notification or affording an opportunity for consultation.  This practice is affecting small and medium-sized businesses throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Although a credit review process has been established, it applies only to new loans.  What structures are in place for small businesses that find themselves at the mercy of their banks?  These businesses have a long track record but find the terms and conditions of their overdrafts are changing.  I was speaking to an individual recently who could not obtain a €10,000 advance from the bank to pay his lease although he was always given it in previous years.  The individual is running a successful retail unit that will continue to trade because there is a demand for it, but because he could not obtain funding he had to let go a member of staff.  Stories such as this are real and can be heard throughout the country.  They are very serious because the employers affected comprise the lifeblood of the economy.  Without them, towns and cities would not be functioning.  This is what is happening.  These are the real stories.  There are very serious stories throughout the country.  These people are employers.  They are the lifeblood of our economy.  If they do not employ people, our towns and cities will not function.  I am using this opportunity to raise this matter again.  It will continue to be raised.  It is a serious concern for people who are at the mercy of their banks.  The terms and conditions of loans can be changed at will without consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">I would like to make a point about the future of banking in this country.  Six weeks ago, in late March, Mr. Larry Broderick, who is the general secretary of the Irish Bank Officials Association, expressed his view that members of his union are facing the future with trepidation.  The recent loss of 900 jobs in Quinn Direct shows how vulnerable large-scale financial institutions are at present.  It is obvious that changes will be made to the whole banking structure.  Many people are fearful about losing their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Another matter that is addressed is the credit union movement.  This legislation will have an impact on credit unions.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has welcomed the amendment to section 35 of the Bill.  It is important to say that smaller credit unions have some difficulty with the definition of "impaired loan" in this Bill.  This point has been made to me by the manager of a local credit union, who has been working in the credit union for 25 years.  Members of credit unions can miss payments because they are on holidays, or over the Christmas period.  They always make up the balance over the course of the year.  Under the terms of this legislation, such loans will be considered to be impaired.  There is some concern within the credit union movement about this issue.  Members of the Health Services Staffs Credit Union, for example, have had to renegotiate their loans on foot of the recent pay cut and the reduction resulting from the pension levy.  Are such loans now deemed to be impaired?  I understand the Minister for Finance and officials in his Department are engaged in ongoing discussions in this regard.  I am sure the matter will be explored further on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I had wanted to raise the whole issue of auditors and auditing.  Throughout this period, auditors were looking at the banks' books.  We need to look at the whole situation.  There is a body of opinion that believes auditors are too close to their employees — the credit institutions.  Auditors are appointed by the boards of such institutions to audit their yearly accounts.  Perhaps a degree of cosiness sets in over the years.  Do we need to introduce changes in this area?  Should auditors be rotated?  Should they be approved by the Financial Regulator?  Such changes should be considered if we are to renew confidence in our banking sector and ensure that what happened before is not repeated.  I accept that they would have cost implications for the credit unions, but we are familiar with the cost implications for the taxpayer arising from the current approach.  I refer to the fall-out we are dealing with today.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I look forward to debating the various amendments that will be proposed on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_317">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_405">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010.  Over recent months, many people have quoted Edmund Burke's remark that "there is a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue".  When the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, presented this legislation to the Dáil, he spoke of the admirable grittiness of the Irish people in dealing with the issues that have come before us in the past two years.  He spoke about emergency budgets, actual budgets, bank guarantees, the recapitalisation of the banks, NAMA and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  What Burke meant over 200 years ago was that there is a tipping point in all matters.  When the Minister for Finance came into the House over a month ago to outline Anglo Irish Bank's capital requirement, a tipping point was reached in this case.  The sheer size of the requirement is staggering.  The capital required by the bank, which has been described by the Minister for Finance as an "institution of systemic importance", is mind boggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Despite Anglo Irish Bank's growth of 30%, year-on-year, no alarm bells went off in the Financial Regulator's office in this regard.  If this type of growth were associated with gangland activity, the Criminal Assets Bureau would get involved in the issue immediately.  If such growth were associated with clients of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, departmental inspectors would be immediately on the scene.  Why was such growth allowed to continue when the participants were dressed in pinstripe suits and wore collars and ties?  Such questions must be answered in the forthcoming banking inquiry.  It is presumptuous to bring this legislation, which is one of three proposed Bills on the Central Bank, before the Oireachtas.  What is the point in enacting legislation before one knows exactly what one wants to legislate for?  Is something else going on here?  Is the Government sincere in its proposed banking inquiry?  Is it prepared to present the true and unvarnished story to the Irish people?  The nature of the inquiry, along with the period the inquiry deals with and this rush to enact legislation to regulate our banking system, indicates that it will be a whitewash.  The establishment of a toothless inquiry, designed to appease coalition partners, is another example of what the late Séamus Brennan described as the difference between senior and junior hurling.  New legislation for the Central Bank on regulatory affairs should not be drafted and presented until we know the full story.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">One of the glaring problems in our economy is the lack of available credit.  We have gone from one extreme to another.  Money was too freely available without proper regulation, but now businesses are being starved of cash.  If one walks down any main street, one will witness the carnage being endured by small retailers.  Whited-out windows and lost jobs are the norm.  I continue to get postcards from retailers who want the rules governing rents to be reviewed.  I call on the Government to amend the existing legislation to ban upward-only rent reviews.  Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business.  Small and medium sized enterprises, which provide a great deal of employment in this country, need access to credit.  The Government has failed miserably on this point to date.  As a result, jobs have been lost and businesses have been forced out of existence.  If this situation is allowed to continue, the country will never emerge from recession.  Every week in my clinics, constituents complain about the lack of credit being made available to them.  It is time for the Government to draw a line in the sand and ensure that business people who seek money to run viable businesses have access to credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Successive Fianna Fáil Governments have led this country into the financial quagmire in which we now find ourselves.  Their failed policies, which poured more fuel on a grossly overheated housing market, have resulted in half finished housing estates and empty hotels all over this country.  There is a prime example of this in the village of Clarecastle, County Clare which was reported on by Jerome Reilly in the <i> Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday week.  This development was to comprise 25 shop and office units, a crèche and almost 100 homes but today it is surrounded by a 7 ft wooden screening and the site is only occupied by security guards.  The community of Clarecastle rightly asks questions.  What now for this landmark site?  Will it become an eyesore or will it be knocked down and returned to a greenfield site?  Will it have a community purpose?</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Members of the public are beyond angry as they, together with their children and future generations to come, will have to pay for this mess, which has been created by Fianna Fáil, the banks and the light touch regulation regime they encouraged.  At the very least, where a building development has failed and is taken over by the banks or NAMA, the community should have a say in what happens to the site.  The "Prime Time Investigates" and "The Frontline" programmes earlier this week highlighted ghost estates, unfinished estates and failed commercial developments throughout the State.  These need to be dealt with in the proper manner.  Will the Minister of State try to do something in this area?</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I welcome the progressive parts of this legislation associated with the changing of the rules for credit unions.  This sector of the financial services industry has been a quiet success over the years and as our supposed conventional high street system repairs itself and its balance sheets, with the cost passed on to the taxpayer, credit unions will play a significant part in keeping credit flowing, however limited, in the economy.  This supposed conventional high street sector was the historical poster boy but it will become the unglamorous cousin that keeps the show on the road.  Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 will be amended by the Bill to add greater flexibility to credit unions' long-term lending arrangements.  This is a welcome initiative, which addresses the need for credit unions to be in a position to facilitate rescheduling of loans due to the economic climate.  The credit union system and its financial methodology will play a more significant role in years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">There have been many changes in our banks over the past two years, which have made it more difficult for the customer, whether individual, business or SME.  It came to my attention that one bank in County Clare during the summer of 2008 changed many of its managers.  Working relationships that had developed between a customer and bank manager over the years had to be re-established and, in many cases, this was never the bank's intention anyway.  To do this when customers needed such a relationship most only shows the cavalier and fundamental attitude of self-interest of our banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The banks and the Government up to now have been under the impression that their role is not one of facilitation to an economy but rather in the economy itself.  This is deluded thinking and the sooner we retreat from this position the better.  We will never recover economically until there is a political shift in emphasis from financial services and banking to producing items for sale, whether that is food, electronics or even intellectual property.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I spoke recently to a man who retired as manager from one of the two big banks.  He took early retirement in 2003 mainly because he did not like what he was seeing.  He did not like the pressure put on him to sell what he saw as worthless products to customers or the chase for mortgage business with the altering of loan to value ratios.  Most of all, he did not like the change in culture that he could see happening.  He had spent his career in one institution.  He used to have the power to make a lending decision at his desk.  This changed and he had to pass all applications, however small, to what he called "group credit control".  He saw that the system of placing a loan applicant's details into a computer to make a decision was flawed and it undermined the basic principle of banking that he had followed for 35 years, which is trust and human interaction.  The Minister, with his canon of legislation, may think he has the tools to deal with the future but, because of the total breakdown in trust between the consumer and the bank, the fundamental issues have not been dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">It is interesting to see the hand of the European Central Bank come more and more into play in domestic political decisions.  For some time, much of our macroeconomic policy has been determined by Frankfurt and Jean-Claude Trichet.  However, over the past year, a number of Government decisions relating to the banking crisis have been tempered by Europe.  The initial NAMA haircut proposed by the Minister for Finance has been adjusted and, as recently as last week, he became more open to the idea of winding down Anglo Irish Bank for some reason.  The ECB has recently expressed its concerns about the transparency of our new proposed Central Bank system's legal structure in the absence of consolidating legislation and the Minister must address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">This legislation will give rise to a majority of ministerial appointments on the newly proposed Central Bank commission, six to eight out of ten or 12.  The ECB has stressed the need for the commission to be independent from the Department of Finance in this regard.  It is difficult to see how this can be achieved when these appointments are at the discretion of the Minister.  It would be better if appointees such as these appeared before an Oireachtas committee for ratification.  This model of appointment would be more transparent and accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">A further cause for concern about future independence of the Central Bank is the Minister's powers under section 50 to make regulations.  The common theme in financial legislation over the past two years is that many new and significant powers are being vested in the Minister for Finance.  That is not particularly healthy for a democracy and I would prefer to see a more robust position developed for the Oireachtas.  This could be facilitated with a beefing up of the Oireachtas committee system by introducing more regulatory and oversight powers for committees rather than for the individual.  There are good aspects to this legislation but it is presumptuous and it should not be enacted until the inquiry into our banking system concludes its business.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_417">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The Short Title refers to an initiative that needs to be taken but it will not deal with the reforms of the Central Bank that are needed for many reasons but, in particular, because it is rushed legislation.  Even in the context of what happened over the weekend with the ECB and the IMF taking a central role in bailing out the euro because of the weakest link being vulnerable, the reform of the Central Bank and its role, as proposed in the legislation, is ill-informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">We must face the fact that people have lost faith in the bankers, the regulators of financial institutions and those who established the rules for regulators.  They have lost faith in the Government which put in place the powers and rules that govern financial institutions and gave powers of oversight to the Central Bank and the regulator.  Some aspects of the Bill are to be welcomed but in order to know where one is going, one must know where one is coming from and there has not been a full and comprehensive report on where the mistakes were made.  The Government actively and passively contributed to the rapid expansion of the gambling culture of the banks.  When we entered the eurozone and gained easy access to cheap money the bankers increased the availability of credit to all comers and bankers bonuses were a key factor in developing the sales focus of banks instead of prudential loan management and the traditional principles of banking.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">It emerged at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that any banker who expressed a concern was sanctioned, moved on or told to shut up.  As Deputy Joe Carey outlined, if the performance of a business in another area was in double-digit figures it would be subject to an investigation.  Anyone who questioned the banking sector was told that the shareholders and investors demanded that level of performance.  Such practices were allowed to continue because everyone was asleep at the wheel.  It was said that the practices pertaining in the country were reckless.  Large amounts of easy credit due to the financial bubble fuelled developer-led housing bubbles in every town and village in the country.  That increased the cost of houses which were paid for by easier personal credit terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The Central Bank reported that €118.9 billion was outstanding on residential mortgages in the last quarter of 2008.  Many householders were suddenly the owners of unthinkable amounts of debt.  A total of €2.8 billion was due in credit card debt alone.  According to the Central Bank, in 1995, for every €100 earned, €48 was owed compared with €176 for every €100 earned in 2010.  In 1995 we had the lowest debt to income ratio.  The level in Spain was 59% and in France it was 66%.  We increased by 267%, France by 9% and Spain, a country considered to be a basket case, by 120%.  Those countries are in the eurozone and their central banks had the same level of power over the currency and fiscal matters as we did even though we had lost control of certain aspects of our currency to the European Central Bank.  However, those countries managed to perform more sensibly than we did.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The knowledgeable voice of the local bank manager was ignored and the sales focus of the bank became a vision of the future.  It was similar to casino gambling.  The more one lent out as a salesman for a bank, the more one got at the end of the year by way of a bonus.  The financial bubble was one of the core effects because it caused such a bubble in the property sector and affected our competitiveness.  From our accession to the European Union when markets opened up to us we had spent years fine-tuning our ability to have an efficient, competitive, export-led economy.  In the course of a few years we allowed that to completely disappear.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">It is difficult to see beyond the banks and the bankers in particular.  No one disagrees that we must bail out the banks and that we must have a banking system but it is not correct to say we must bail out the bankers.  The same people are still in charge.  No effort has been made to issue sanctions or undertake a proper inquiry.  That is what upsets people and causes unrest.  The Government had better wake up and realise the symbolic importance of the fact that the same people are still in charge.  It is hugely important that those who were seen to have been reckless, negligent and to have profited to such an extent from reckless behaviour, facilitated by light touch regulation, are seen to pay the price.  We paid them large bonuses for providing big loans.  Why are we not able to fine them when the loans default?  Why are we not able to go after those people?  Those are the questions people are asking.  No amount of long-winded speeches in the House about how the fundamentals are being improved will change the perception that exists unless we take direct action.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The Government preached about light touch regulation.  The big players in the banks said they could self-regulate and that they needed light touch regulation in order to stimulate the economy.  The trend of consumer debt to income did not just suddenly change between 1995 and 2008.  A trend was obvious during that period.  Why did no one express concern about it?  In response to the Taoiseach's first budget in his then role as Minister for Finance in 2004, Deputy Bruton referred to the alarming trend that was developing in terms of property speculation that was threatening our national competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Thanks to the light touch, hands-off attitude to the regulation of banks the Government has sold citizens into debt bondage to the tune of €54 billion and that might not be the end of it.  That was taxpayers' money which should go into making a better society and creating jobs.  What a difference it would make if even €20 billion had been available to invest in job creation initiatives, the protection of jobs and concentrating on what we are good at in this country.  A study was published last week by Harvard graduates who work for Bord Bia which indicated that no one was championing the cause of the potential of the food industry to create jobs and to become an even bigger player in our economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">We still do not know all the details of what happened because the full inquiry into the bank collapse and the Government decisions on the banks has yet to be published.  In Iceland last month a report was published into an inquiry on the December 2008 banking collapse.  A similar report is not available in this country yet.  If one is to reform the Central Bank and the governance and oversight bodies one must know where one is coming from in order to know where one is going.  Perhaps some of the existing structures and architecture are suitable but we cannot say that for definite until we know where we have come from.  Without the basic facts on the operation of the banking casinos and their nationalisation there will not be a clean sweep of personnel and genuine regime change in the banking culture, both of which need more regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">What is known is that the Central Bank is in charge of national financial stability since monetary policy was transferred to the European Central Bank when we joined the eurozone in the same way as happened in France, Spain and the other eurozone countries.  The Minister has claimed that in order to make the Central Bank more effective in carrying out its fundamental responsibility the Government is proposing a three-party trilogy of Central Bank reform Bills.  It is intended to restructure the organisation of the Central Bank to ensure better regulation and supervision of the banks and financial companies.  Where is the bank strategy report that clearly states the new vision and strategy of bank culture so that the casino-style bank system that created a debt of more than €80 billion will never happen again?  We need to return to proper prudential banking so that the banks we have capitalised and whose bad loans we have removed can improve their ability to borrow on international markets to lend to small and medium-sized enterprise and operate under conditions set down by the Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Where are the powers in this Bill to enable the Central Bank to make those banks make money available to small and medium-sized businesses to protect jobs and not just shore up their balance sheets and give positive returns for investors, who are being protected by the current position?  As speculators and investors they were glad to take and not share profits by way of any payback into the system and now they want the taxpayer to guarantee them indefinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">In March 2009 I asked the Minister for Finance what his objectives were for the board of management in Anglo Irish Bank and what its strategy was now that it was in public ownership.  The Minister's response was to the effect that the bank was being run on an arm's length commercial basis from Government.  Does this mean that the self-serving enrichment system for staff and shareholders that has operated within the banks for at least four years is continuing as usual, there is no change and neither the Central Bank nor the Financial Regulator has power to enforce change?</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Without new objectives for the bank boards to restore conservative well-regulated banking practices I am seriously worried that the small group of people who have been enriching themselves in the banking property sector will continue as before while the economy continues to wither.  Is it not a case of keeping the public paying and us ignorant?</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I welcome some parts of the Bill.  Other speakers have mentioned the whole issue of the credit unions, which is a welcome amendment.  The credit unions have also welcomed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">When one comes to analyse where we are today regarding the economy being in trouble, it is impossible to get away from the manner in which the banks operated.  Professor Patrick Honohan has said that bank regulation, although compliant with international standards, was nonetheless complacent and permissive: "Too much reliance was placed on an international risk model deployed by the regulated entities."  Even the Financial Regulator's consumer consultative panel found that the regulator was far too lenient when policing the larger players in the financial services sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The OECD pointed to the specific issues around Allied Irish Banks in particular and said that the regulator was far too weak in dealing with this bank.  That is the nicest thing one could say about the regime that pertained and the way the Financial Regulator performed his duties.  It was gross negligence which has amounted to a catastrophe for society, the economy and citizens, with the debt and the bondage of some €54 billion that has been imposed on everyone in the State.  We have to change it.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">I received an e-mail before I came into the Chamber from a former member of the old consultative group, who said the advisory committee that has been established has no real teeth and will not have any real input into the new Central Bank commission, its findings, determinations, etc., including how it will hand down rules to the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">If ever the people at the top needed to listen to what is happening on the street, it is now.  I am sure many Deputies on the Government side as well as in Opposition have to listen to the anger and frustration among constituents as well as their total perplexity about how this is being allowed to continue, that is, the State bailing out people who have made a mess and allowing them to continue in office.  It is one thing to protect the structure and the banking system, but it is a totally different matter to decide to protect those who made the mess in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">This is at the heart of the Fine Gael amendment to this Bill, on foot of which we oppose giving the Bill a Second Reading, because — the European Central Bank has made this point — it reserves the system of appointment of directors to the new Central Bank exclusively to Government with no proper scrutiny by the Oireachtas or any external body.  It is a case of jobs for the boys.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I have just drawn a little diagram with the signs of the Olympic symbol, five rings, all intertwined.  It represents the upper strata of society in Ireland in business, banking, accounting, etc.  NAMA is now appointing people from the estate agencies, auditors and accountancy firms who promoted the slogan, "Buy now — it is never a bad time to buy a house", and fuelled the price increases.  These were the same firms which were in charge of looking after the accounts of some of the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">People have the perception that these golden circles are all intertwined and cannot be broken up.  If we are going to do this seriously, we have to examine the situation and make root and branch changes to the system.  The Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 should be the start of this, but, unfortunately, it is not.  I hope that people in Government and in the Department of Finance will take on board the concerns that exist.  Some of them are symbolic and in so far as symbolism is important, people have to see changes taking place.  However, there is much more that is down to the nuts and bolts, for example, the power of the Central Bank commission where it has concerns.  A three-year plan is fine, but an updated report on that plan at least twice a year to the relevant Oireachtas committee has to be part and parcel of its implementation programme to show how the figures are improving and how the banks are behaving and responding.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">We have to be able to ensure that the banks that we now support and guarantee by way of sovereign debt report to and are responsible to the citizens of this country.  Anything less by way of reform is only using the word as a cover-up.  It would mean that people will lose even more faith.  We have a long way to go to restore faith in the Government, the banks and the Financial Regulator.  I implore the Minister of State to take on board the concerns that have been expressed here by Members of the Opposition who have no interest in seeing the economy going down the Swanee.  It is not in anybody's interest.  I have four children and I do not want to see them having to emigrate.  I am no different from most Members in this House.  I ask the Government to listen to what has been said.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_319">
          <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_439">One of the mysteries in the whole banking crisis and property difficulty is why we did not see it coming or know about it.  Almost everybody surfed the wave, including many commentators who appear to have the solutions today.  I do not ever recall reading in the Economist Intelligence Unit's reports where Ireland was heading.  Perhaps someone will tell me I am incorrect, but I cannot recall seeing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">One of the reasons we did not see what was happening was that we all spoke in terms of property.  We spoke about the rising price of property — the property bubble.  However, this was not a property bubble but a money bubble — the free and easy availability of money.  History shows that when assets grow at an extraordinary rate, something is actually wrong.  This is a weakness in our system, not necessarily the regulatory system but in our political system.  Time and again during the ten years I have been here, I have spoken about the necessity for futurologists and people in Departments, no more than those in normal business, to project what is going to happen in the future.  Maybe we should consider having a ministry for forecasting, in which this responsibility would be given to one Minister.  Everybody is so busy in their day-to-day lives with crisis management.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The public, and even we in the Opposition, like to see things working.  We like to see the country do well, and we would like to see the measures introduced by the Government working.  However, time and time again we have sat here and listened to pronouncements, predictions and commitments which have fallen through sand.  Often, these assertions are made in a confident manner but without confidence and without any significant basis.  It is a major weakness in our system.  Surely we could amalgamate various sections of our Departments to form one which would deal purely with anticipating the difficulties ahead on the macro scale, as opposed to the micro scale.  It is a case of not seeing the wood for the trees.  That is one of the main reasons we are in the current situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">If we look back through history, we will see asset bubbles as far back as the South Sea bubble and the tulip mania in the Netherlands.  These show us what can happen when assets are overvalued.  The purpose of this Bill is to put in place a domestic regulatory framework for financial services, giving rise to stability, proper supervision and confidence and thus protecting the interests of consumers and the country.  Our regulatory system clearly failed us, but we do not know why because we have not had a proper inquiry.  We have had a few scoping inquiries but thus far we are not sure why it happened.  There are mixed views on this.  Perhaps our system did not fail us, but rather the culture, and individuals failed as a result of that culture.  This new Bill will give us a Central Bank commission and the Oireachtas will receive an annual regulatory performance statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Almost a year ago, Fine Gael introduced a policy document on reform of the committee system.  We can talk about sending things to committees, but the committees do not have the resources to deal with them.  We have too many committees.  Some Members of the Houses are on five or six committees and, as a result, they are unable to take their duties seriously.  They are running from one committee to another and they are not prepared for meetings because they do not have time, and neither do the committee secretariats.  We must halve the number of committees.  We need to strengthen the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and make sure the Committee of Public Accounts works effectively; we also need an enhanced Joint Committee on European Scrutiny.  However, we must consider amalgamating committees so that each Member is on only one committee.  Committees should also be staffed in a manner that ensures they meet their requirements.  At the moment the system is dysfunctional, as everybody in the House knows, and there may also be a suspicion outside the House that this is the case.  It is a disgrace that we are actually participating in a system we know is dysfunctional, and it is a reflection on us in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The consumer information function will be transferred to the National Consumer Agency.  Fine Gael moved an amendment on Second Stage of the Bill declining a Second Reading, as discussed by Deputy Doyle in his submission, because we do not have an investigation report and therefore we cannot know how the system needs to be changed.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service produced an excellent document dealing with regulatory failure in Ireland.  I do not know whether it has been read into the record; I do not propose to read it today, but I may do so another time because it is an interesting document.  We do not know why the system failed and whether it was the fault of the culture or of individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Directors will still be appointed to the new Central Bank commission without Oireachtas scrutiny.  They will be nominated at the behest of government.  There are also shortcomings in respect of the powers the commission is given, including that of placing failed banks into managed administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Fine Gael has been asked several times over the past couple of years to don the so-called green jersey and to follow the Government blindly.  On occasion we have supported the Government, but I must say, on reflection, that if we had known all the details before the introduction of the bank guarantee on that fateful day at the end of September 2008, we might not have been so willing to extend the guarantee to Anglo Irish Bank or Irish Nationwide.  We were told at the time that the recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank would cost around €4 billion; now, it looks as though it will be at least €22 billion.  Similarly, we were told the recapitalisation of Irish Nationwide would cost €1 billion; it has now become €2.7 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">When the Minister for Finance was questioned on the radio one morning, perhaps by Cathal Mac Coille on "Morning Ireland", about the estimated bad debt of Anglo Irish Bank, he responded to the effect that it was a dangerous line of questioning.  Surely the Irish public are entitled to know the amount of bad debt carried by an institution it is about to bail out.  If someone came along and asked me to act as guarantor for a bad debt, the first question I would ask is "What is the extent of the bad debt?".  However, the Minister for Finance portrayed this line of questioning as being unpatriotic, implying that such pertinent and relevant questions were undermining the country's financial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The chief executive of AIB at the time used words to the effect that he would rather die than see recapitalisation of the bank.  Everybody was wheeled out to tell us the fundamentals were strong and that stress testing had been carried out.  We were told lie after lie, but we believed them because we wanted to.  Most of us had a belief in the system.  The people who believed in the system are now those who are most angry.  A large section of Irish society never believed in the system and always felt we had a two or three-tier society.  Others thought we had a good society, but they have been let down badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">We were told the bank recapitalisation would allow credit to flow.  However, I am not aware that this has occurred.  People are in despair.  Their lives have changed for the worse and they are wary.  This gives rise to complete disillusionment with the whole system.  They believe there is no accountability.  It is now one and a half years since the financial crisis began but they do not see anybody paying for his or her sins.  They do not even know what these sins are, because we have failed to date to establish this.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">There was a protest outside Leinster House last night.  I have no difficulty with peaceful protest, no matter how large or small, but I condemn the activities of a small number of protestors last night, and also some commentators who, in recent weeks, have almost incited such a protest by asking why Irish people have not protested more vigorously.  One can make one's silent protest in the best place, which is the ballot box.  Irish people will soon get their opportunity to protest because we live in a democracy.  I call on those commentators to be responsible.  Yes, we are all annoyed.  Sometimes I would love to go over to the Government benches and tear them down, but that is not how it should be done.  Change must be achieved through the ballot box.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Will we see a change of culture in the banking system?  Deputy Doyle mentioned that most of the people who made mistakes are still in place.  There is a misaligned interest.  Those who work in the banking system do not work for the common good.  They work for profit for their shareholders and bonuses for themselves.  A major cultural change needs to take place within the banking system, which may require nationalisation; I do not know.  Those who work in the system must realise that the banks work for the economy and the country, not for the shareholders.  This misaligned interest is one of the fundamental reasons we have had these difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The public want to know what happened in the days leading up to the bank guarantee.  Morgan Kelly wrote an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> a few days afterwards.  Was the official advice not to include Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide?  Were telephone calls made directly to the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance which changed their view, thus lumping us with the €20 billion plus guarantee for those two institutions?  What actually happened on that night?  Will we ever know?  Is there any paper trail?  Will history tell us what happened?  I do not like to enter the realm of speculation, but my view is that the advice was that Anglo Irish Bank should not have been included under the guarantee because it was not of systemic importance among our financial institutions.</p>

Can the Minister of State confirm that some of these personal guarantees which existed in hard copy only have gone missing?  I have heard anecdotal evidence that this is the case.

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_459">I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 43 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_460">The enterprise stabilisation fund, ESF,  was established by Government in 2009 as a two-year scheme to support viable but vulnerable exporting companies experiencing difficulties because of the current economic climate.  Some €78 million is currently being provided under the ESF for 2009 and 2010.  At 30 April 2010, a total of 227 applications had been reviewed and 197 projects from 193 companies had been approved for €72 million under the ESF, of which €64 million has been paid out to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_461">As with any budget process, the 2010 budget exercise necessitated taking account of emerging priorities as regards enterprise support.  In this context, priority is being given to a wide range of financial supports for SMEs, including research and development grants, supporting companies which are resuming a growth path and providing assistance in developing lean manufacturing processes.  Prioritisation is always necessary and in this instance it was clearly appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_462">The Irish economy is now entering a recovery phase and we must take this into account in the allocation of funding across the range of Enterprise Ireland programmes.  The companies Enterprise Ireland is now assisting include those that are still vulnerable, but just as importantly those that have shown their potential for high growth and increased export sales.  This balance between supporting those companies which are still vulnerable and those which are ready to grow is the key to stabilising the position of some companies while facilitating others to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the recovery in global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_463">The overall funding allocated to Enterprise Ireland for company supports in 2010 amounts to €278 million, which represents a 26% increase on the outturn for 2009.  This increase is a reflection of the Government's commitment to supporting enterprise in whatever form is necessary as our priorities shift over the coming year.  Allocations to particular schemes are kept under constant review and adjusted to meet our economic needs at any given point in time.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_324">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_464">I was very concerned when I read the story in the newspaper about the reduction in the budget for the enterprise stabilisation fund, because the fund is one of the more effective measures introduced by the Government to stabilise viable companies during the recessionary period.  Does the Minister agree that the Government has a budget strategy — with which I largely agree — and a banking strategy — with which I profoundly disagree — but has no strategy when it comes to jobs and competitiveness?  It seems that every time the Government announces measures, they do not address the scale of the unemployment problem and when introduced are only introduced half-heartedly or late.  We had such a situation with the work placement programme, which had few participants and few beneficiaries, the enterprise stabilisation fund, which we discussed already today, and the temporary employment scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_465">One scheme about which I would particularly like to ask, and on which the Minister may wish to comment, is the commitment to introduce a PRSI holiday for employers who take on new employees.  I was the first to propose this almost two years ago and it is also supported by the Labour Party.  It was announced in the budget, five months ago, that the Government would introduce this scheme to give employers a two-year holiday from PRSI payments for new employees.  However, five months after the budget it has not been introduced.  Will the Minister explain why?</p>

            <p eId="para_466">I take issue with the Deputy with regard to the Government not having a jobs strategy.  Governments do not create jobs, but create the environment in which jobs can be put in place.  I am satisfied the Government has a strategy that will create jobs.  Take for example the IDA Ireland programme, Horizon 2020, which will create a number of jobs through a programme that will run from 2010 to 2014.  It is specific with regard to the number of jobs and projects it will create.  More than 67,000 jobs will be created over this short period of time, but the agency is confident it can meet its targets and is going about its business in a professional manner.  Enterprise Ireland also has a strategy to create jobs leading to 2014.  Therefore, we have synergised the foreign direct investment and the growth and promotion of the indigenous sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_467">We have also introduced the stabilisation fund and the employment subsidy scheme.  All of these measures have had a massive impact during what has been an extremely trying period.  If the Deputy looks at the indications——</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_478">Is it correct that €22 million has been cut from this fund?  The Minister said he is reviewing the situation and that like all expenditure allocated in his Department, the fund must be subject to review.  The €58 million spent up to end 2009 supported approximately 7,500 jobs.  Up to the beginning of March this year, some 26 applications had been received, from which nine companies were approved, supporting 200 jobs.  If there is a cut of €22 million, some 50 companies — based on the average of €415,000 support for each company — will apply but will not get job support.  This cut is just being flagged now.  There was no announcement about it, which makes it a stealth cut.  Is the Minister not concerned that if there is a cut, this will have serious consequences for these companies?  In the context where these export-led companies are vulnerable but could return to profitability, is it not the position that our way out of the recession is through export-led growth?  We must get away from dependence on property bubbles etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">Most of the aid has been given in terms of redeemable shares and repayable grants.  Why, therefore, would the Government contemplate cutting or reviewing something that is making a significant contribution to sustaining companies, particularly in the export sector which is important for maintaining employment?  How many companies have applied for assistance to date and how many of these will now find their applications for financial support rejected if there is a further review or cut in the enterprise stabilisation fund?</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_480">It is important to give the Deputy the facts and details before me.  There was additional demand and some €58 million was paid in 2009 to 180 projects, which supported approximately 7,500 jobs.  The remaining €20 million has been allocated to the fund for 2010.  Therefore, from the launch of the scheme in 2009 to date, some 197 projects from 193 companies have been approved for funding.  No company to date which has qualified and met the criteria has been left without a grant.  Those companies that were rejected did not meet the criteria.  We estimate in the Department that we have approximately 30 applications waiting to be assessed and we have approximately €6 million still in the fund.  The 30 applications are now being evaluated and will be dealt with over the next couple of months.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_481">There is €6 million left.  If these companies receive the average support given to the other companies, approximately €450,000 or €420,000, they will require approximately €13 million.     The Minister will be short of money, assuming they all qualify.  Why would any curtailment be put on this sector, in particular?  It is export led, there is growth in that area and it is sustaining employment, with the potential for future employment.  Is there any restriction in this context?  The stabilisation fund and the employment subsidy were announced as a package.  I hope there is no review of the employment subsidy taking place along similar lines to the review that is taking place in this case.  Surely the one sector that should not be curtailed is one that sustains, maintains and promotes employment opportunities.  I remind the Minister that only for the emigrant aeroplanes and ships there would be 75,000 more people on the live register today.  Let us not discount that.</p>

            <p eId="para_482">I also said there was €278 million available to Enterprise Ireland, which is a 26% increase in the overall funding to enterprise.  The mechanisms in place in Enterprise Ireland are diverse and varied to suit various applications.  If a company does not meet the criteria for the stabilisation fund, it is possible that it could be supported under a further mechanism under the aegis of Enterprise Ireland.  That is what happens.  The Deputy mentioned €30 million as the cost for 30 projects.  That is wide of the mark.</p>

            <p eId="para_484">We will not get an absolute evaluation of that until we have examined all the projects and seen their size.  They could all be quite small projects which might not demand as much money as previous projects.  Supports are available in diverse areas of expertise from Enterprise Ireland.  If a company does not get support under the stabilisation fund, it is possible that it could get support under a different mechanism.</p>

        <b>Deputy Willie Penrose</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</b>
         when he will implement the commitment contained in the Revised Programme for Government 2009 to introduce on a statutory basis a code of practice for the grocery goods sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [19458/10]

          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_342" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_486">The renewed programme for Government contains a specific commitment to "implement a code of practice for doing business in the grocery goods sector to develop a fair trading relationship between retailers and their suppliers" and "to review progress of the code and if necessary to put in place a mandatory code".  The Government will give effect to this commitment by including a specific provision in the legislation currently being prepared to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority which will allow for the introduction of a statutory code of conduct in the grocery goods sector.  I expect to publish this legislation later this year.  In the interim period, until the legislation is enacted, the opportunity will be taken to explore with all relevant stakeholders the possibilities of agreeing a voluntary code.  I have appointed Mr. John Travers as facilitator to engage with stakeholders regarding the drawing up of a voluntary code.  Mr. Travers previously served as chief executive officer of Forfás and as acting chief executive officer of Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, at its inception.</p>
            <p eId="para_487">The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that there is a fair balance in the relationships between the various players in the grocery goods sector, particularly given the importance of this sector to the national economy.  The introduction of a code, as provided for in the programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders, including the interests of the consumer, and the need to ensure that there is no impediment to the passing on of lower prices to consumers.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_343">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_488">Is it fair that some commercial companies are abusing their strong or dominant position in the grocery sector by exerting undue and unfair pressure on other commercial companies with which they have business relationships or transactions?  That is clearly an imbalance of power in the supplier-retailer relationship in the grocery trade which leads to unfair practices being employed.  Outrageous sums are being demanded by some of the big players in this sector — it is not the small or medium-sized shops that are doing this — in exchange for the privilege of getting products onto supermarket shelves.  This is bad for both suppliers, including the farmers who cannot get their produce onto the shelves of major supermarkets, and consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_489">Is the Minister aware that the primary producers, farmers and agriculture-related industry, and the key providers of food are not getting fair play in the food supply chain?  Their viability is being seriously undermined.  The country will end up with no basic primary producers.  Is the Minister further aware that the committee on enterprise, trade and employment produced a report which stated that a statutory code of practice, to be overseen by the Ombudsman, would have to be put in place?  That is the position as a result of the third report from the UK competition authority.  The UK authority is anxious to investigate issues, unlike ours which only investigates small concerns.  It is time the Competition Authority took on the big operators in this country, not chase small shops and the like.</p>

            <p eId="para_490">With regard to "hello money", there are specific provisions in the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 that prohibit both retailers and goods undertakings from being involved in the compelling of another undertaking.  The Act also specifically prohibits retailers from compelling suppliers to make payments for providing space.  I am aware that the committee has done much excellent work, but we have not yet received its report.  It is due to produce a report by mid-summer.</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_492">I look forward to receiving that report in the context of the voluntary code of conduct that we hope will now be facilitated by the appointment of Mr. John Travers.  Obviously, we will feed recommendations from the report into that process.  However, it is important to stress that even though the legislation is still in place, nobody has come forward to state that they were compelled by a particular group to pay money or to do anything else that is prohibited under the Competition Act.  That makes it very difficult for us to act.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_493">Surely the Competition Authority can go into a concern and carry out a investigation, as the UK competition authority did.  We learned the plain facts in the course of our investigation.  We do not know who was involved because it was carried out anonymously and in confidence so we do not know who the players were.  However, the position is clear.  People are afraid to come forward and give evidence in case they are de-listed and lose their opportunity to sell their goods in the market.  Prime quality produce is produced in this country by our farmers and others and they are entitled to a fair price, as is the consumer.  Ultimately, however, if the primary producers in this country go out of business, everybody will suffer, including the consumer.  While we should not forget the importance of the jobs in the major retail stores, there are also jobs at primary production level that are important and provide a living for people throughout rural Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_494">The legislation will allow the competition body to investigate complaints and will provide for sanctions.  It will give extensive powers to the competition body to search premises and remove documents.</p>
            <p eId="para_495">The UK model, as the Deputy knows, still has a deficiency in that it is still trying to find an efficient and effective way to deal with the issue of how one compels.  We are hoping that through the voluntary code and the interaction between both sides there will be a fair balance between the stakeholders.  This will form the basis for a mandatory code that can be put in place as part of the legislation.  We hope Mr. Travers, with his experience, will be able to bring the two together and that it will be possible to put a voluntary code in place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_497">The Innovation Taskforce has identified an ambitious set of recommendations to transform Ireland into a global innovation hub and drive job creation in innovative export-focused sectors.  Recent changes in departmental structures have brought innovation to the fore in my new Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, and the Deputy will be aware that the Government has asked that I personally chair a high-level implementation committee to oversee implementation of the report of the taskforce.  The implementation committee is composed of top industrialists and Secretaries General of key Departments.  CEOs of State agencies and officials from other Departments will also participate in the work of the committee as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_498">The Taoiseach has asked all Ministers to prioritise the implementation of recommendations from the Taskforce report for which they are responsible.  In that context, I have asked my ministerial colleagues to review the current state of play on each of the recommendations for which they have lead responsibility.  This review will enable an initial stocktaking by the implementation committee to ascertain those issues where we can move immediately to implementation, where we need to work in the first instance through expert working groups as specified by the taskforce and where we need to engage closely with agencies and other Departments to progress implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_499">Some recommendations are already being worked on.  For example, the taskforce made a number of recommendations relating to the management of intellectual property, IP, and access to state-supported IP.  A review has been under way to determine whether the current IP arrangements for publicly-funded research in Ireland were optimum.  The implementation of the recommendations arising and specific recommendations of the taskforce are being progressed through the harnessing of the expertise and goodwill of practitioners and experts who have contributed to this work.  I will be making further announcements in the coming days on how these skills will be harnessed to progress this agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">Implementation of other recommendations will require reprioritisation of resources.  These will need to be considered by Government and I will be bringing any such proposals to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal for consideration.  Tax proposals will be considered in the context of the budgetary strategy.</p>

This is another implementation body, another review group.  The Minister stated this implementation group will, first, review the recommendations to determine where implementation is possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_502">Of the review group he announced this week, eight were already members of the taskforce on innovation.  The taskforce on innovation has produced many recommendations.  It has given a time line, in terms of immediate, short-term and long-term recommendations, and has given the cost implications.  I suggest that much of the review has been done.  Let us not have any more reviews.  Would we not have immediate implementation because people are frustrated by what they see is yet another body to oversee and to implement?</p>

            <p eId="para_507">The composition of the implementation group includes a majority of private sector persons — nine as against eight — and the idea is that private sector involvement will drive it.  The Taoiseach has indicated clearly that it is a cornerstone of our jobs strategy into the future.  We are absolutely intent, by me chairing the group, to ensure that there is joined up action and joined up thinking across departmental boundaries and that such will be further advanced by the participation of the persons who are on the taskforce who brought in the recommendations and who are still on that taskforce to drive the implementation.</p>

            <p eId="para_509">Will the Minister accept all the recommendations of the taskforce?  Are they subject to funding?  The Minister mentioned, in his first response, a re-prioritisation of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_510">Returning to his initial response, I welcome what the Minister stated about looking at the IP area, that he set up a review group immediately.  That was one of the immediate recommendations of the taskforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_511">In another area, the taskforce could create 117,000 jobs over the next ten years.  The Minister also said it this week; he supported it.  In reply to Deputy Varadkar earlier, he mentioned the Horizon 2020 strategy of IDA Ireland involving 57,000 jobs.  Are these separate jobs?  Is that 117,000 plus 57,000 or is there an overlap?</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_512">The taskforce as such was looking at a particular aspect of industry and how it could grow that industry.  Certainly, its report would be seen as separate.  They will merge because IDA Ireland will drive the foreign direct investment and Enterprise Ireland will be involved in the indigenous sector.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_522">Since 2004, a key element of our labour market policy has been to ensure that general labour and skills needs are met from indigenous labour and from within the workforce of the European Union.  For strategic skills or labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors, our policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand.  The various schemes that give effect to such policies — green cards, work permits, spousal and dependant work permits and permits for intra-company transferees — were introduced following enactment of the Employment Permits Act 2006 and came into effect on 1 February 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_523">Currently, employment permit holders constitute approximately 1.2% of the total labour force.  Given that our current employment permit arrangements were designed to be vacancy-driven, the number of permit applications and, consequently, the number of permits issued over the last two years have been showing a consistent downward trend.</p>
            <p eId="para_524">In early 2009, we undertook a review of employment permit arrangements to ensure their ongoing relevance to the needs of the Irish labour market.  As an outcome of this review, more stringent eligibility criteria were implemented for prospective new entrants to the work permit schemes from 1 June 2009 onwards.  The main features of the new measures included expanding the ineligible list of occupations for which permits can be issued; increasing by 50% the fees charged at renewal stage for new permits issued after 1 June 2009; and a reduction in the number of occupations for which green cards are issued.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">The Employment Permits Act 2006 allows for regular review of our economic migration policies and our Department keeps these policies under review, in line with the emerging needs of the labour market, on an ongoing basis.</p>

            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
            <p eId="para_526">I put it to the Minister of State that the lazy approach that has been taken on the reform of work authorisations, whether permits or green cards, is costing the Irish economy and costing potential Irish jobs.  Is it not the case that three years ago there was a shortage of labour to fill job vacancies and now there is a shortage of jobs, and we need to attract people into this country who will create jobs?</p>
            <p eId="para_527">I also put it to the Minister of State that what we have now is enterprising inaction within the Department rather than innovation.  Is it not the case that his Department, along with the Department of Health and Children, has failed to reform the visa and work authorisations for non-consultant hospital doctors that is leading to a situation where accident and emergency departments will close this summer?  Is it not the failure by the Minister of State and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to reform the international education sector that is costing us a potential 6,000 new jobs?</p>
            <p eId="para_528">I congratulate the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe on his appointment.  One of the key recommendations of the Innovation Taskforce report is that incentives be provided to highly qualified students to remain in Ireland post qualification.  What steps are being taken under the green card system to allow that to happen?</p>
            <p eId="para_529">Can the Minister of State explain why a document published on the Department's website this month about green cards does not carry the correct title of the immigration service and nor does it show a link to its website?</p>

            <p eId="para_530">I am not aware of the specific document to which the Deputy refers and I will revert to the Deputy.  Our green card system is still very responsive to the areas mentioned by the Deputy.  Green cards are still issued for ICT professionals such as computer systems managers, analysts, programmers and testers.  Green cards continue to be issued for health care professionals, for all medical practitioners and for those working in areas in the health system where there are vacancies.  This continues to be Government policy.  For the information of the House, a total of 775 green cards were issued in 2009, which is one third of the number issued in 2008.  All those permits were for occupations for which there were strategically important high level skills shortages.  Green cards are issued according to enterprise priorities if those priorities cannot be filled from within the indigenous or EU labour force.</p>

            <p eId="para_531">Why are green cards not issued for non-consultant hospital doctor posts?  Why are green cards not issued for highly qualified PhD graduates, as recommended by the innovation task force?</p>
            <p eId="para_532">I have two supplementary questions about work permits.  In a parliamentary question on 9 February I asked the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to supply the statistics on new work permits issued.  I have not received a response as yet.  Is it the case that the Minister of State is not monitoring the situation?  Last month, the number of work permits increased by two thirds in the service industry in April of this year compared to last year, the highest recorded increase since December 2008.  The Minister of State is asleep regarding what is happening.</p>

            <p eId="para_533">I reject the assertion.  We are continuing to monitor and to work with the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland, MRCI, and a range of Government agencies with regard to work permits.  The target for processing correctly completed applications — these are the three key words — is 15 working days.  Green cards, inter-company transfers and health care sector applications continue to be processed within this timeframe.  There has been a delay in processing other employment types.  It is generally taking 12 weeks to issue such type of permits——</p>

         the cost of maintaining the unused buildings and grounds formerly used by Enterprise Ireland, Glasnevin, Dublin 9; the action he will take regarding these costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_539">The cost of maintaining the Glasnevin site is approximately €1 million per annum, made up of local authority rates, security, heat, light, power and general maintenance.  This figure includes general maintenance costs of the national metrology laboratory of the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  For 2010, these costs are expected to be in the order of €140,000 approximately, which will be recouped from the NSAI.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">Resulting from the centralisation of Enterprise Ireland's Dublin offices in East Point business park in 2008, it is anticipated there will be annual savings of approximately €3 million, in addition to significant operational efficiencies.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has been in contact with the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, with a view to the Office of Public Works assisting in whatever way possible.  The Minister has also asked Enterprise Ireland for an assessment of how the current costs for maintaining the site might be reduced in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_541">In that context, Enterprise Ireland has advised that the current rates bill for the site, which is available for leasing, will reduce by 50% or €280,000 in respect of 2010.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has advised it has also secured an 8% reduction in the fees paid in respect of security services provided on the site.  Pending any further advices from the OPW, in December 2009, Enterprise Ireland engaged estate agents to explore potential leasing options for the property.</p>

            <p eId="para_547">I have done some research and I have listened to the Minister of State's answer very carefully.  He is saying that the national metrology laboratory is using a small part of the site at a cost of €140,000 a year.  I have no problem with this.  However, the remaining €1 million — €860,000 in the difference — is being used to maintain a site that is not in use and has not been in use for several years.  That is the Minister of State's answer.  He may wish to clarify if it is not his answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_548">I have two brief supplementary questions on that point.  There had been a plan that this area would be used for the forensic science laboratory and this has now been changed.  There had been a plan for it to be used for affordable housing.  Is it still intended to use the site for affordable housing or has this plan also been changed?  Is it not the case that other areas of the Department, including some agencies directly under the Minister's purview, are renting offices at a cost of hundreds of thousands of euro?  How can the Minister of State justify a situation whereby one part of the Department is spending hundreds of thousands of euro renting private offices when the Department is spending hundreds of thousands euro to maintain empty offices?</p>

            <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_549">I wish to make it clear that the affordable housing initiative no longer has an interest in that site.  I remind the Deputy that strong interest has been expressed in the site.  The people advising the Department on its disposal, sale or further leasing say there is strong interest.  Perhaps the Deputy did not hear that part of my response where I mentioned that Enterprise Ireland has saved €3 million annually by moving from this site to another site.  Quite a significant saving has been achieved for the Exchequer, in the order of €3 million, by the consolidation of Enterprise Ireland into a new site, thus vacating the many buildings it occupied previously.  This is a 14-acre site with 18 buildings and which has a significant associated security cost, in the order of €240,000.  It costs €120,000 for heat, light and power for the many buildings and facilities already in existence on the site.  There is a general maintenance charge of €40,000 for the site.  I hope that answers the questions.</p>

The OPW is working to ensure that all lands, not just those belonging to the Exchequer, to ourselves or to line Departments, and all public buildings around the country are properly audited.  To date, the OPW does not have a centralised register of all publicly-owned property, not just the core assets of Departments but also the wider local authority and health services sites.</p>

        <b>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</b>
         asked the

         his views on the fact that a number of Government Departments are falling short of meeting the targets set by him that suppliers would be paid within 15 days of the receipt of an invoice; the steps he will take to ensure greater compliance with the target set; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_575">In accordance with the Government's decision of 19 May 2009, all Departments are required to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice.  Departments are also required to report quarterly to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation on their performance in meeting the target.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">The first returns by Departments covered 15 June 2009 to 30 September 2009 and were published on 30 December 2009.  The second set of returns for the last quarter of 2009 were published on 5 March 2010.  The third set of returns for the first quarter of 2010 are available from today on my Department's website under the small and medium-sized enterprises publications link.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">The ongoing publication of these composite returns by the Department provides clarity on the performance of individual Departments in meeting the terms of the Government decision.  While there is some variation between the performance of individual Departments and fluctuations across the three quarters, overall performance has been positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">In the first quarter of 2010, the returns show that in value terms, Departments paid 96.7% of invoices within 15 days compared with 97.9% for fourth quarter figures and 97.8% for the third quarter; ten Departments paid in excess of 90% of invoices by value within 15 days; four Departments paid in excess of 80% of invoices by value within 15 days; and one Department paid 79% of their invoices by value within 15 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">Departments are playing their respective parts in assisting the cash flow of their suppliers, many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  The new procedures and processes introduced are having an impact in assisting the cashflow of SMEs in the current difficult economic environment, a welcome development.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">It is the responsibility of each Department to meet its obligations under the terms of the Government decision.  Any businesses that experience difficulties in receiving payment on foot of valid invoices within 15 days should contact the contracting Department to resolve their difficulties.  It is incumbent on those Departments whose performance is lagging behind to improve their payments profile over the coming quarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">The Minister has already indicated his intention to bring forward proposals to shorten public sector payment periods in areas beyond central Departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_582">I thank the Minister of State for his useful reply.  Cash is king in sustaining businesses and many profitable ventures have gone under because of a lack of cashflow.  Has any Department which has not stepped up to the plate, a lagger, been subject to late interest penalties under the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002?  Under the regulations, interest charged on any outstanding amount for goods or services is 7% above the European Central Bank interest rate.  Has any Department had to pay this interest charge?  If not, then why is it not complying with EU regulations?</p>
            <p eId="para_583">Will the 15-day average for payments extend to semi-State and departmental agencies such as the Health Service Executive?  Many of them are not the fastest out of the traps when it comes to paying for goods and services.</p>

            <p eId="para_584">I am not aware of any Department having been punished for late payments.  Broadly speaking, the record is quite good.  The Minister is determined to extend it to other public service bodies, including local authorities and the HSE.  Local authorities report a 30-day average for payments while the HSE stands at a 45-day average.  It has already agreed to reduce this to a 30-day limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">The issue for the Minister is to decide whether this 30-day average should be shortened.  The best option in the meantime is to achieve an average somewhere between what is required of central government and the current 30-day average.</p>

            <p eId="para_589">That is just one Department.  I would be pleased to share the league table with the Deputy so he can examine it.  If the average is 80%, then some Departments should pull their socks up and get their act together.  However, the record is positive and is even acknowledged to be so by Deputy Willie Penrose.  The object is to widen the 15-day requirement to the wider public service in which 30-day and 45-day averages seem to be the order of the day.</p>
            <p eId="para_590">It is, however, easy to bash public service organisations.  According to the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association the average time it takes a private sector business to pay its bills is 90 days.

Under the 2002 commercial transaction regulations, a Department is required to pay an interest rate of 7% above the ECB rate, which means 8%, on any late payments it incurs.

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_601">Given my recent change of portfolio, I have not yet had the opportunity to arrange a face-to-face meeting with my Northern Ireland counterpart, Arlene Foster, MLA.  However, I have spoken to her by telephone three times over the past several weeks on Quinn Insurance and the impact of redundancies on the company and the local economy.  We discussed the possibility of preparing a joint proposal to apply for European Union funding under the cross-Border INTERREG programme for training initiatives and start-up business supports.  Work on this joint proposal is now being progressed at official level.  We also discussed how our officials could work together in other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">The inter-agency response team, which I established under the chairmanship of Mr. Dan Flinter, will work with Mr. Leslie Ross, who has been tasked with chairing a similar response team established by the Northern Ireland authorities.  I also spoke with Sir Reg Empey, Minister for Employment and Learning, about the specific issues arising from the Quinn Insurance announcement.  I will keep in regular contact with my counterparts on this particular issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">On the broader issue of co-operation, I will meet the Minister, Ms Foster, MLA, at the next North-South Ministerial Council meeting in June.  The Deputy will be aware that under the British-Irish Agreements there is already a wide range of cross-Border activities aimed at economic development.  These arrangements are augmented by co-operation on a less formal basis, which has been taking place between Departments and agencies North and South for many years.  These arrangements cover matters such as enterprise and business development, labour market and skills, trade, tourism and investment promotion and science, and technology and innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">I refer to examples of these activities.  InterTrade Ireland, co-funded by my Department and its counterpart in Northern Ireland, was specifically established to support cross-Border activities across a range of activities including innovation, enterprise development, networking and policy development.  Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland collaborate on an all-island innovation vouchers scheme and on trade missions abroad.  IDA and Invest Northern Ireland co-operate in Donegal and Derry in the North West Now collaboration.  The IBEC-CBI Joint Business Council carries out an extensive North-South work programme.  Ongoing co-operation between Governments on both sides of the Border, together with the work of the agencies on the ground will continue to support economic development and investment in the Border region.</p>

            <p eId="para_605">I would have preferred if Question No. 90 had been taken with Question No. 47.  I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  The fact that he indicated he has had only three telephonic link-ups with his counterpart in the Assembly, Ms Arlene Foster, MLA, does not demonstrate the necessary focus on the very serious situation that has unfolded in the Border counties, specifically, Cavan and Fermanagh.  The announcement last Friday week signalled some 432 jobs would be lost in Cavan and Fermanagh, in excess of 50% of the entire signalled loss of 846 jobs throughout the island of Ireland in Quinn Insurance Limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">I am not at all impressed by the Minister's reply which is somewhat dilatory.  The reality is if such an announcement were made in respect of any other part of the country there would be a far more focused and definite effort on the part of Government to try to save the jobs concerned.  While I welcome and encourage cross-Border co-operation in the address of the terrible vista that has now presented for these workers, their families and the wider and interdependent community, real and serious questions must be answered.</p>

            <p eId="para_608">We cannot divorce ourselves from the lead-in situation to the announcement of 900 redundancies in Quinn Insurance Limited last Friday week.  Real and substantial questions must be put in respect of the decisions taken by the Financial Regulator.

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_609">I absolutely reject the Deputy's suggestion that I was not proactive in this regard.  When it first came to my notice I made it my business to meet Mr. Quinn.  Subsequent to understanding the difficulties that were to arise, I contacted Mr. Frank Ryan, chief executive, and Hugh Cooney, chairman, Enterprise Ireland.  I asked them to make arrangements to meet immediately with Mr. Quinn in respect of the matter.  From the very first day, Enterprise Ireland interacted with the Quinn Group.  I made it my business to contact Arlene Foster and Reg Empey.  I made it my business to instruct officials in the Department to check out the feasibility of an application under the North-South INTERREG programme to establish whether we would qualify.  I made it my business to ensure that when the redundancies were announced I remained at home rather than go on a trade mission to Australia and to be in Cavan to meet the administrators to hear what they had to say and to establish how we could facilitate what was taking place within the group.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">At the moment the announcements were made all the agencies were in place and a one-stop shop was established in each of the locations.  An opportunity for workers to look for advice and to seek support was provided.  I secured the agreement of the Northern Ireland Minister for Education and Training to a €1 million activation fund for the areas affected by the redundancies.  As the Deputy is well aware, discussions are still ongoing.  Recently, the Taoiseach met not alone with the Cavan Chamber of Commerce but with the elected representatives of the workers.</p>

It is all very well to refer to education and re-training afterwards.  For heaven's sake, do not utter "taskforce" across this Chamber to me because I will surely take ill.  The fact is the Government has yet to demonstrate properly why it was not feasible or explain why it could not have introduced a Government timeframed guarantee to underscore the solvency deficit in respect of Quinn Insurance Limited to allow the company to continue to trade throughout the Six Counties and in Britain, where it was relatively embryonic, where over a short period it could have established its viability and profitability and where it had already demonstrated its competitiveness among the other players in those markets.  That was what the Government could have done to save the jobs rather than react after the event.</p>

It is an extraordinary and very serious situation because everyone maintains the Quinn company is a good and profitable company but it appears to be falling on its feet every hour because of its inability to sell commercial insurance in Northern Ireland and the UK.  I hope some progress can be made on the matter before the weekend is out.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I realise he is new to the job.  Were he to examine the situation in the Border counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Donegal, he would realise no investment has been made in the whole area, especially since the Troubles.  I ask the Minister, on the occasion of his first Question Time, to ensure that a genuine effort is made, taking into account the Quinn Insurance situation as it is today, to ensure the area is prioritised.  I am not satisfied that personnel in IDA and Enterprise Ireland are committed to the area.  If it was not for Seán Quinn there would be nothing there.</p>

            <p eId="para_635">I welcome Deputy Crawford's positive approach.  It is important to acknowledge that this is an outstanding company and that the people losing their jobs are of the highest calibre.  We must do everything possible to assist them.  We should also keep in mind that 1,900 people are still employed by the company and that the administrators are confident these jobs can be sustained and hopefully expanded into the future.  We must generate confidence in the company in order to ensure its ongoing viability.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">I have put staff from all the industrial development agencies into the Border region.  The IDA has been made acutely aware of the need to provide opportunities for those who will lose their jobs at Quinn Insurance.  As staff take voluntary redundancy, the administrators will make available to the IDA and to Enterprise Ireland details of their skills and experience.  The development agencies will tailor that to the jobs that can be created and the businesses that should be supported.</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_639">I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 80 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">As both the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority were established under statute, it is necessary to give effect to the newly merged body by way of primary legislation.  At the time the merger of the two bodies was announced, as part of the rationalisation plan for State agencies during the 2009 Budget Statement, work on a review of the operation and implementation of the 2002 Competition Act was well under way.  The various submissions received following a public consultation process were being considered, as was the report and recommendations of the advisory group on media mergers.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Rather than give effect to the amalgamation of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority in a stand-alone Bill, to be followed in due course by legislation to amend, reform and update the 2002 Act, it was decided to introduce a single comprehensive Bill that will create the new consumer and competition body, update existing competition law, strengthen the public interest test in respect of media mergers in line with the report of the advisory group on media mergers, make some minor amendments to the consumer protection legislation and give effect to the Government commitment under Towards 2016 regarding the exemption of certain specified categories of vulnerable workers from competition law.  While work on the draft legislation on this basis has been progressing, developments in other areas have arisen which have led to additional requirements in the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_642">The renewed programme for Government contains a specific commitment to "implement a code of practice for doing business in the grocery goods sector to develop a fair trading relationship between retailers and their suppliers" and "to review progress of the code and if necessary to put in place a mandatory code".  An enabling provision for this code will be provided for in the legislation.  This all-encompassing approach has to some extent delayed the legislation for the rationalisation of the two bodies.  However, we will be better served in the long run by a single legislative measure that both establishes the new body and provides for a combined and updated consumer and competition code with appropriate enforcement provisions being given to the new body.  Work on the draft heads of the Bill is now at an advanced stage and I intend to bring these draft heads to Cabinet within the coming weeks.  I hope to publish the Bill in the autumn.</p>

            <p eId="para_643">I apologise for neglecting to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, on the occasion of his first Question Time, on his appointment to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  I wish him the very best in his new role.  However, there is one aspect of his appointment that has not been clarified for reasons unknown.  The Minister did a reasonably good job as Minister for Education and Science, particularly in terms of how he dealt with difficult decisions in regard to cutbacks, including reductions in class sizes.  It is still not clear to me why he and the Tánaiste have switched roles.  The Minister may wish to comment on that in his reply.  We are all very curious about it on this side of the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_645">Vacancies occurred in other Departments due to illness and resignation, but we have no idea why the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and the Tánaiste switched Departments.  It would be interesting to know the reason.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">I thank the Minister for his reply to these questions.  Can he offer an assurance that the new legislation will not be used to weaken the Competition Authority in any way?  One of the strengths of that body is that it has an executive board made up of experts in their field who tend to act like regulators, in the mould of ComReg or the Commission for Electricity Regulation, rather than taking the more passive approach of the traditional State agency.  It is very different to the National Consumer Agency in that regard.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_647">I thank the Deputy for his good wishes.  I am sure he will help me along my way.  On the question of ministerial appointments, the Deputy will have to put down a question to the Taoiseach.  All such decisions are his prerogative.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">By merging the two bodies in question we can produce a stronger entity, but there is no point in doing so unless the new body has teeth and the ability to implement its remit.  I am willing to listen to the Opposition in terms of any amendments it puts forward during the debate on the legislation.  It is in all our interests to have an effective code and a body with powers to ensure businesses act within the law and that restrictive practices are removed.</p>

          <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_452">
            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_649">I wished the Minister well last Thursday when he introduced the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2010 in the House.  He made a good start by indicating his receptiveness to Opposition amendments.  Ministers who close their minds generally end up with the smile on the other side of their face because we chase them up.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">Will this merger generate any savings?  There is a significant degree of overlap across many agencies in all sectors.  Deputy Varadkar has been on the case on this issue for some time and is broadly correct in the points he has made.  The Competition Authority does important work in dealing with cartels and so on.  However, I am concerned at the manner in which it has chased up some issues.  We will have nothing but ghost towns if it continues with its current policy where pricing is the only parameter that counts and there is no consideration for value and service.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">The Competition Act 2002 has been a source of great problems for people in part-time employment such as artists, freelance journalists and actors, with the bodies that represent them being defined as undertakings.  That was never put forward as the desired interpretation during the course of any debate on the legislation in this House.  However, it is the interpretation arrived at by the Competition Authority which seems to have <i>carte blanche</i> in this regard.  Does the Minister agree that the people to whom I referred are entitled to have collective bargaining rights and negotiating rights attributed to bodies on their behalf?  I refer to the Irish Pharmacy Union, Irish Dental Association and Irish Equity, the SIPTU branch representing actors, among others.  Surely the time has come to honour the commitment given in Towards 2016 by amending section 4 of the legislation to reflect the will of this House.  The Competition Authority must adhere to the provisions of legislation passed by the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_653">But that is part of it.  It is a fundamental of the Labour Party that we stand for trade union rights, and it is important that those are not taken away at the stroke of a pen.  That is what has happened with section 4.  I said that in this House 18 months ago and I am still right.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_455" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_654">On the question of savings, I advise Deputy Penrose that both bodies are operating at staffing levels below what would have originally been sanctioned.  The NCA has 39.4 whole-time equivalents — WTEs — and 80 were sanctioned.  The Competition Authority has 43.2 WTEs and 59 were sanctioned.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">I anticipate that the staff complement of the new merged body will be less than the posts allocated to the two bodies.  That must be considered in the context of the overall control of public sector numbers.  I expect there will be savings from shared services in back-office activities such as human resources and finance.  The NCA is taking over the functions of the Financial Regulator relating to consumer information and education, and  some staff have already been transferred.  The two agencies are located in two separate buildings, and the issue of relocating them to one building is being examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">Deputy Penrose raised the issue of what powers we will give the new body.  Regarding direct complaints to the Competition Authority, the forthcoming legislation will not only restate the provisions on anti-competitive conduct in the grocery goods sector in the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2006, but include additional provisions to make it more attractive for people to pursue actions against grocery goods undertaking.  That is subject to the advice of the Attorney General.  The legislation provides for relief by way of aggravated damages and allows the courts the discretion of limiting the costs of action taken by parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">Where the court has determined that a particular practice is anti-competitive on the basis of an action taken by the new body, the parties taking private follow-on actions should not also have to prove that the particular action was anti-competitive.  I view that as very progressive.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">Is the Minister happy that the new authority will be able to control some of the extremely serious situations involving the supermarkets and our large agricultural sector? They insist that money is paid up front for shelf space and so on.  The food industry is currently under extraordinary and severe pressure.  Farmers are getting only about a third of the price that the consumer pays for milk.  Such issues must be dealt with, or we will end up with no production in this country and everything produced elsewhere.</p>

I realise each Department has its own small group that considers forward planning, but we could easily amalgamate some of the Departments and allocate specific responsibility to a Department for macro forward planning.  If we did that, and employed people to concentrate on the issue as opposed to dealing with crisis management and fire brigade action, and day-to-day activities, perhaps such a crisis could be foreseen.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">When the current regulatory legislation was bundled together and consolidated in 2002, my party's spokesperson on finance at that time, Deputy Richard Bruton, pointed out that he was concerned that the legislation was not stress-tested and had shortcomings.  He was proven correct, in that the system aligned to the culture did not work.  We will not find out why it did not work until there is a full, frank and open inquiry.  I do not know when the scoping inquiry is due to report, but the sooner it comes before the Dáil and we agree terms of reference for a comprehensive inquiry, the better.  I hope that it will not be akin to the Moriarty or Flood-Mahon tribunals — those have been going on for well over a decade, which is unacceptable.  I call on the Minister and the Taioseach to set a deadline by which the tribunals must report to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">We have another shortcoming in this country.  The German Parliament held a debate on the allocation of the aid package to Greece.  We have had very little discussion on that, other than at Leaders' Questions or Taoiseach's Question Time.  I strongly advocate that the Taioseach should attend the House before the European Council meetings when we should debate the issues that are due to come up and the approach that is likely to be taken.  That will ensure we get the views of Members in the House and discuss the matter.  We in Fine Gael support the bailout of Greece, but certain conditions must be attached to it.  We cannot blindly go along doing those things if we do not have an input into them beforehand.  The Taoiseach mentioned earlier that amendments to the Lisbon treaty might be needed to facilitate the bailout, but I understand that is not correct as Article 122 of the treaty permits the bailout.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The public want to see the results of the banking inquiry and they want those who are culpable to be brought to justice.  They want a system in place in which they can have confidence, but that cannot happen until the wrongdoing is addressed.  The culture of banking and financial management in this country has to change.  The misaligned interests must be realigned.  The financial institutions are there to support an economy — they do not exist solely to create profit for the shareholders.  While making profit is one aspect, it should not be the sole aspect.  The financial institutions' function is to assist with the development of the economy.  Ultimately, responsibility for overseeing and managing the economy lies with the Government, not the Central Bank, Financial Regulator or individual banks.  It is in this regard that the Government failed miserably.</p>

        <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_463">
          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_672">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I fully support the amendment of the Fine Gael finance spokesman, Deputy Richard Bruton.  The legislation is being introduced prematurely.  The investigation into what went wrong with the banking system is ongoing.  The reports by the Governor of the Central Bank and the two wise men into the reasons for the crash and the fiasco in our banking system have not yet been produced.  We have had no report on, or inquiry into, what went wrong in the banking system even though the man on the street knows a certain amount about what took place.  Nobody has been held accountable for what happened in the banks.  The banks were completely reckless, particularly by giving 100% mortgages and by increasing credit limits on credit cards on a six-monthly basis.  This was very unfair and wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The Government was complicit regarding what went wrong, yet no politician has put up his hand to accept responsibility for the decisions made.  There were critics, including economists, who flagged much of what was to come down the tracks.  Organisations such as the IMF and OECD published reports continuously outlining the overheating in the Irish property market and banking sector, yet the property market was talked up consistently.  We were consistently told that the fundamentals were sound in the property market and that home owners were to make purchases at current prices or else miss the boat and not get an opportunity to purchase a property again.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">Bankers were not held accountable for what went wrong.  Certain bankers, who are still working for Irish financial institutions, were complicit in what went wrong and were present when some of the bad and reckless decisions were made by those institutions, yet they are being rewarded handsomely with very high salaries and profit sharing schemes.  Despite this, the ordinary worker is paying obscene tax and is being hammered from every direction by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">Bank auditors were asleep at the job, particularly in regard to certain transactions in Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life and Permanent at year-end.  It was very poor form for auditors to miss the key transactions and not report them.  There is an onus on them to do so.  They have failed shareholders, particularly by signing off on accounts year after year without having seen some of the transactions and without flying the red flag to show creative accountancy was taking place or that the banks were not functioning as they should.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The relationship between the political establishment, the Financial Regulator, the Governor of the Central Bank and the Minister for Finance was too cosy.  The Bill seeks to change this relationship but it is being introduced prematurely before a full investigation has been carried out.  We have not yet heard what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I acknowledge the improvements that have taken place under the new Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Hohohan.  He is doing a terrific job.  The new Financial Regulator, Mr. Elderfield, who has clearly put his own stamp on the job, is very independent and is not for turning.  He has brought new realism to the Office of the Financial Regulator.  People are not happy with what happened with Quinn Insurance but the regulator has ensured there will not be as many problems in the insurance industry as might have arisen.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">There is no evidence to state the existing regulatory bodies were responsible for what went wrong in Ireland.  The Government is glad to make a scapegoat of the former regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank and make them ultimately responsible for the fiascos that occurred.  By doing so, the Government is only trying to save its own skin.  No responsibility is being taken at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The former regulator was definitely at fault, yet he is being paid a handsome pension and is enjoying all the trimmings associated with his former position.  It is very poor that nothing has happened in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">It is clear that responsibility must be shared.  The Government allowed the banking crisis to happen and never shouted "Stop" at any stage over the years.  It never sought to cool down the overheating property market because it was hooked on all the stamp duty receipts that were consistently coming into the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The procedure for the appointment by the Minister for Finance of the new directors to the Central Bank commission is very flawed.  The Minister will have exclusive responsibility to appoint directors.  The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service should have a vetting responsibility to ensure directors appointed have the necessary expertise.  The Oireachtas should be comfortable, on a cross-party basis, that the people being appointed are the right people to do the job.  Deputy Bruton and other front-bench spokespersons have been consistent in their criticism of the appointments procedure.  The Oireachtas should have a more central role in overseeing the appointment of new directors to new bodies or existing quangos.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">The Committee on Finance and the Public Service should have an opportunity to question potential appointees.  There ought to be accountability and transparency in making appointments.  Politics has failed people and we need a new form of politics.  More scrutiny and probing of potential appointees would bring more comfort to the people.  Merely appointing individuals without scrutiny amounts, in certain instances, to cronyism and is very wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The new Bill does not give the commission bank resolution powers to put failed banks into administration.  This point has been made throughout the debate.  It is crucial that no bank in difficulty be allowed to continue.  It should be possible to wind a bank down without jeopardising the future of the country and its finances.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent a recurrence of the events that saw one or two banks of systemic importance bring down the national economy.  History must not be allowed to repeat itself and this needs to be written into the legislation.  The Irish do not have the stomach to deal again with a collapse like the one that occurred.  People are rightly angry over what went on in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The Minister is not adopting a hands-on approach to interest rates and is allowing the banks to increase modestly their interest rates every so often.  He has recapitalised the banks and they should, therefore, have enough funding without trying to extract more from home owners through punitive interest rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The banks are making the case that the cost of funding is more expensive on the international markets because of what has gone on in this country.  It is clear that home owners cannot consistently absorb all these extra costs on a continual basis.  The only way interest rates will go is up, possibly over time.  It is unfair that first home owners will again be asked to pick up the tab for the problems in our banking industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The timing of the recent wage increases given to the staff of Anglo Irish Bank was lousy.  The decision to allow ordinary workers to get increases clearly damaged the credibility of the banking sector.  The increases were probably justified, as they may have been due to the workers in question over a number of years.  However, the wage increases sent out the wrong signal at a time when other workers are having to tighten their belts.  Public servants, in particular, are facing extreme difficulties as they try to make their mortgage repayments and pay their bills on a weekly and monthly basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">I would like to speak about the insurance industry.  The banking system has dominated the political agenda over the past two years.  Insurers have been resilient throughout this period of financial instability.  The insurance sector merits much more representation in the Bill.  The appointment of six or eight directors to the Central Bank commission is provided for on page 47 of the Bill, which refers to accountants, bankers, economists and lawyers but does not make reference to the insurance industry.  The sheer size of this country's insurance industry means that it should be represented.  That is a clear omission in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">A distinction needs to be drawn between the insurance industry and the banking industry.  One cannot subject both industries to the same amount of regulation.  It is clear that the insurance industry, with the exception of a single company, has not let down the financial sector.  It has always operated correctly.  Its business model, its operations and the risks it poses are very different.  That should be accounted for clearly in this legislation.  The Bill also requires separate divisions to be established within banks to deal with banking and insurance.  That should be stated as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">On the question of the accountability of the new Central Bank commission to the Oireachtas, a proposal for yearly reporting has been made.  It would be better and more timely for Members of the Oireachtas to receive reports every three or six months.  If we are to convince people that things are changing and to improve regulation in this country, it is clearly insufficient to provide for accounts to be produced on a yearly basis.  It does not give confidence to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">Most Deputies have received representations from the credit union movement, which is unhappy that the Bill does not distinguish between banks, building societies and credit unions.  The regulation of the credit union sector has not failed — it is purely the banking sector that has failed.  The excessive regulation of the credit unions poses a serious threat to the movement and may lead to a decrease in the number of volunteers.  Every Member of this House has received a representation to that effect.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance will reconsider this aspect of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">The investment of €22 billion in Anglo Irish Bank is a topical issue at the moment.  It is in the news most days of the week.  The Fine Gael position on the matter is crystal clear — we are looking for an immediate wind-down of the bank, which cannot continue the way it is going.  A great deal of money has been invested in Irish Nationwide, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  People are angry about the light touch regulation that took place in this country.  The Taoiseach, who was the previous Minister of Finance, and certain parties within the banking sector, such as the auditors of banks, have to be accountable for what has gone on.  We will probably never hear the full truth about the level of reporting between the Financial Regulator, the Governor of the Central Bank, the previous Minister for Finance and the previous Government.  I am sure a certain element of truth will come out during the investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">It is premature to introduce this legislation before the results of the banking inquiry have been released.  A certain element of the Bill makes sense.  We are not 100% sure that it was the regulatory system that let us down.  Perhaps individual people in certain positions were unqualified and should not have been in those positions.  The Irish people are angry about what has gone on in the banking sector and about the money that is being absorbed here.  They cannot understand that schools are being closed and the home help hours of those who need help are being reduced, at a time when a great deal of money is going into the banking sector.  I will leave it at that.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_698">At a time when the current Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, the Central Bank stated clearly in three separate financial stability reports that the Irish financial system faced grave risks.  The Central Bank felt so strongly about these risks that it mentioned them in its annual reports of 2004, 2005 and 2006, also when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance.  The annual reports of the Central Bank were addressed to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who either did not read them or ignored the warnings in them.  The Central Bank blew the whistle and rang the alarm bells loudly.  We are in this terrible mess because the then Minister for Finance did not listen to or act on the Central Bank's warnings.  The Governor of the Central Bank produced three annual reports for the Taoiseach while he was Minister for Finance.  The warnings in those reports cannot be denied — they are written in black and white and are available for everybody to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">In the 2004 annual report of the Central Bank, which was published in 2005 when the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, was Minister for Finance, the Governor clearly expressed his alarm about the turn the economy was taking.  He was concerned about the amount of money people were borrowing.  The 2004 report warned that a sudden fall in house prices was the greatest threat to the stability of the banks:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_700">The risk of an unanticipated and sudden fall in residential property prices, accompanied by an increase in the default rate among mortgage holders . . . . is the risk that poses the greatest threat to the health of the banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">In the third paragraph of the Governor's foreword to the 2004 annual report, he states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_702">There are still concerns, however, about the increase in indebtedness in the economy, after another year of strong growth in mortgage and non-mortgage credit last year, with the ratio of debt to disposable income of households now in excess of 120 per cent.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">On pages 33 and 34 of the report, the Governor of the Central Bank continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_704">The overall conclusion of the Financial Stability Report 2004 was that ‘the Irish banking system is currently in a good state of health despite the sharp slowdown in the growth rate of the economy that occurred in recent years.  Our central expectation, based on our assessment of the risks facing both the household and non-financial corporate sectors, as well as the current shock absorption capacity of the banking system, is that its current good state of health will not be compromised over the medium-term horizon.  However, this central expectation does not preclude the possibility of adverse developments which, should they materialise, could have serious financial consequences for households, corporates and banks.  The risk of an unanticipated and sudden fall in residential property prices, accompanied by an increase in the default rate among mortgage holders, who may have been too willing to take on ever higher levels of indebtedness at the bottom of an interest rate cycle, is the risk that poses the greatest threat to the health of the banking system.'</p>
          <p eId="para_705">The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, told people they were missing the boat, to get on quickly to buy and that his main concern was that if they did not act immediately, property would be out of their reach within a few years but the fundamentals were correct.  The current Taoiseach also stated the fundamentals of our economy were sound.  People were mocked and those who issued warnings and sounded alarm bells were accused of financial treason and of being naysayers.  Commentators who were prepared to go out on a limb and call it like it was and who advised about the very things the Central Bank was warning could and would happen were ignored and scorned and laughed at.  It was suggested scurrilously at one stage that such people should go away and consider suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">I am afraid it is questionable to introduce a Bill now which seeks to change the method by which the bank operates without addressing core difficulties around the fact that it issued warnings and the fact that the regulator was asleep at the wheel.  Was he asleep at the wheel because somebody had administered a hypnotic substance or because somebody told him to look the other way?  We do not know and we will not get the answer through the current investigations.  It is clear a combination of factors, many of which had the hand of the Government on them, has led us to the sad and sorry mess we are in now.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The Central Bank sounded the alarm bells repeatedly.  In its 2005 and 2006 annual reports, which were addressed to Deputy Brian Cowen as Minister for Finance, its officials clearly repeated these warnings.  If they had been heeded, there would have been no need for the bank guarantee and we would not have found ourselves in the position we were two years ago.  Five years prior to the guarantee, the financial stability report of the Central Bank warned that the banks were becoming more vulnerable because they had begun to borrow money from abroad to give people mortgages in Ireland.  Any semblance of probity and prudential lending went out the window.  The old adage that applied to bankers whereby they did not lend more than 80% of their reserves flew out the window under the eyes of the then Minister for Finance who cheered from the sidelines along with the then Taoiseach.  Not alone did they fail to observe the golden rule of only lending 80% of their reserves, they exceeded this threshold to borrow money from abroad, which has left us in a position where Ireland has one of the highest levels of personal indebtedness in the developed world.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">On several occasions the financial stability report warned that the financial system would be in trouble if, in the future, Irish banks were unable to borrow money from abroad.  It stated: "It is increasing the banking system's dependence on cross-border inflows of funds, thereby introducing risks around both the continued availability and cost of these cross-border funds in the future".  How prescient, for that is precisely where we find ourselves.  The inter-bank rate rather than the ECB rate impacts on the ordinary man or woman on the street when he or she seeks to borrow money or renegotiate a mortgage.  The inter-bank rate has shot up because banks no longer trust each other's deposit base.  Government members presided over a scenario where bankers could defraud the regulator with ease by moving huge sums from bank to bank and rename it as an investor deposit as opposed to an inter-bank loan.  The more we are reminded of how we got here, the more angry people will be and the more convinced they will be that this legislation is a smokescreen and a fig leaf to distract from the problems we face and the reasons we face them.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The report also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_710">In the presence of market stress there is no guarantee that this source of funding would be available to an equal extent. [That has come to pass]. This poses the question as to what the impact on the supply of credit might be in the event that Irish banks, for whatever reasons, would not be able to source adequate funding from these markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">They have had to be recapitalised by the taxpayer.  The report also highlighted that too much money was being borrowed.  The officials clearly emphasised that their models were issuing warning signals because of the level of borrowing in the economy and they called the speed at which debt was accumulating "particularly worrying".  They stated: "The Central Bank has warned on numerous occasions that the recent and current levels of lending growth may be excessive".  That was code for the Minister to put the brakes on but he looked the other way.  The report continued: "Private-sector indebtedness ... is now at historically high levels. ... In addition to a concern on the overall level of indebtedness, a particularly worrying aspect is the speed at which this debt continues to accumulate."  The then Minister for Finance took no action and allowed the party to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The report further stated: "The Bank's concern with excessive credit growth in Ireland and household indebtedness is borne out by the credit related indicators, most of which, issue warning signals as credit growth continued to increase rapidly in 2003."  Despite the bank warning that the speed at which debt is accumulating was "particularly worrying", Deputy Cowen did nothing.  It was referred to as "masterly inaction", which has led to a catastrophe for the country.  Any right minded, reasonable, logical person would have to conclude his failure to act caused the amount of debt to double during this term in office.  Because of his inaction, for every €1 that the public owed when he became Minister for Finance, they now owe €2.  The public owes an additional €190 billion because of his failure to act.  Irish household debt increased twice as quickly as it did in the rest of Europe.  For every €1 of income that Irish households earned, they owed almost €200 by the time Deputy Cowen left the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Rather that debating the technicalities of the structures of the Central Bank, we need answers from him.  Did he read these reports when he was Minister for Finance?  If so, why did he ignore the warnings?  The legacy of his tenure is horrifying and it is there for everyone to see and, unfortunately, to live with.  It is possible to calculate the total debt in the economy.  EUROSTAT provides figures for every member state's national debt and total household debt.  The figures are shocking.  The Greeks are in their mess and they are drowning in debt.  Every Greek person would have to pay €37,000 to clear the debt owed by the Greek Government and Greek households.  What of the Irish?  Every person would have to pay €70,000 to pay the debt owned by the Government and Irish households.  That is almost twice as high as the amount for Greece.  The figure is astronomical.  One way or another that money must be paid back by ordinary working people.  The Government debt must be paid by money collected in taxation and household debt must be paid from workers' take-home pay.  People who are trapped in unemployment will not be able to contribute to paying money back.  If the debt is to be paid back by workers, then every worker will have to pay €165,000 to clear it.  The figures from EUROSTAT are real.  They come from the central banks and finance departments of each of the countries concerned.  The data is from 2008 and 2009.  I doubt it would be unreasonable to presume that today's figures are even worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">This very clearly highlights the dangers of the Government's plans for Anglo Irish Bank.  It is daft to think we can take on the bank's losses when every worker is already expected to pay €165,000.  Keeping the bank open will be a catastrophe for this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">All one has to do is look at what is happening.  Through what can only be described as clever accountancy the Minister sought to describe the €4 billion already put into Anglo Irish Bank as an investment.  The European Commission certainly does not agree with that.  It now wants the Government to put that sum on the books.  One could be forgiven for the perception that the very clever accountancy that got us into this mess in the first instance is the same methodology that is being used to get us out of it — but it will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Ordinary people in the street are aghast and amazed at what they see, namely, people lying on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital.  They see hospital beds and departments being closed all over the country — in Beaumont Hospital and in Portlaoise.  All around the country health services are being pulled back.  They see the money allocated to the fair deal system being used to transfer patients from long-term care in publicly funded facilities to private facilities.  They wonder how billions can be poured into the banks, yet we cannot afford the millions we need for the health service, to educate our children and to secure our future.  It is quite obvious that everyone, except perhaps the chosen few, want to see Anglo Irish Bank closed in an orderly fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The bondholders are big boys.  They went to the races and put on their bet but the horse did not come in.  The taxpayer cannot give them a two-way bet and give them their money back even though they lost.  They have to accept some of the loss themselves.  They are not foolish.  I do not accept that Ireland Incorporated's reputation is damaged by that because Ireland Incorporated did not borrow the money.  Anglo Irish Bank did, and let it, its bondholders and those who support them take the hit.  We are getting signals that the Minister might be starting to listen and that perhaps that will happen.  I hope he does listen because it would be a terrible catastrophe for this country if we continue to shore up the bank which is very slow to tell us what the true story has been.  I accept new management is in place and that the information is emerging which was not previously the case.  We have been led up the path and sold a pig in a poke.  We need to close down the bank and force the bondholders to take the hit.  They are responsible for gambling their money.  They made huge profits when the bank was expanding and now there is no choice but to force them to accept the consequences of their gambles.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">The country is standing on the edge of a cliff.  We need to face up to those issues.  The Bill is a waste of the House's time.  Rome is burning and we are arguing about the nitty gritty technicalities of reforming the structures of the Central Bank when, in fairness to it, it clearly warned us, but the man who should have been listening and the person who had responsibility for listening did not listen and we find ourselves in the current situation.  We were warned of the dangers we faced and the dangerous path we were on but people just carried on regardless — people who should have known better.  The Taoiseach of this country was the Minister for Finance at the time.  It is clear to me and the vast bulk of the citizens of this country that what we need is not reform of the Central Bank <i>per se</i> but a change of policy and a change of government.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_478">
          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_725">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to say a few brief words.  I understand the debate on the Bill is drawing to a conclusion.  The saying "We are where we are" drives people daft.  It is not a question of recrimination, although I understand people's anger and the need for them to be given a legitimate opportunity to express it.  Last night outside Leinster House we saw what happens when people are denied that opportunity in that a less acceptable mechanism was evident.  Most people are interested in how we re-establish a financial regulatory framework that will ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">I do not doubt the Minister's bona fides but it is entirely premature to talk about reform of the Central Bank when we are still waiting for the results of the inquiry.  We have debated the shortcomings of the inquiry, which we on this side of the House find entirely unsatisfactory.  It is entirely inappropriate to reach conclusions and put in place a new infrastructure dealing with financial regulation, the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank without knowing whether it was a fault of the regime, a cultural fault or due to the individuals who failed to act in spite of having all the necessary powers, or, as has been said, when they did articulate concern that the Government, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach did not want to know.  It is difficult to comprehend why we are having this debate when we are still awaiting the outcome of the inquiry.  That does not inspire confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I understand that in terms of oversight we are expected to be inspired and reassured on the basis that the new structure will report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I recall the Financial Regulator telling us he had stress tested the banks and that everything was fine.  We had the same reassurances from the Central Bank and others.  Reporting to the Houses of the Oireachtas and supposedly placating our concerns about a faulty architecture does not wash.  It has all the semblance of window dressing.  Some one decided that this sop would keep those troublesome people on the floor of Dáil Éireann happy but it just is not going to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">This House needs its own root and branch reform.  I spent all morning in a committee meeting investigating the lost at sea scheme.  All political shades of opinion are doing extremely valuable work in the committee but I have the greatest fear that the committee, which is only a reflection of the entire committee system in the Houses, will not do its job properly until this House reforms itself and its structures regarding the way it does its business.  The House will flex its own muscles as a Legislature and the voice of the people.  We shall always find people outside the gates because this House has failed the people who sent us here.  We do not have the appropriate investigative committees.  We have something like 20 committees still operating in the dungeons of this institution busily working away while the Government assumes a monopoly of wisdom and gets on with the business of running the country, blithely unaware of the views of other elected Members.  That system must stop and the House must reform itself.  The commitment that we will have an annual statement from the newly structured Central Bank just does not inspire me.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">On the issue of the appointment of new directors, there is no role for the Oireachtas.  We see on television hearings being held in other democracies such as the United States, where appointees to every position are quizzed, regardless of whether it is to the banks or the Supreme Court.  That is the type of accountability we want.  Board members of the Central Bank were reflective of the era of social partnership and people are now jumping up and down criticising public policy who were themselves in very important positions, on the Central Bank and elsewhere.  Others were nominated to the boards of these institutions on the basis of being "personalities".  That era just will not wash, but in the new era there is no role for the Oireachtas to approve, vet or question the suitability or otherwise of people being proposed for appointment.  That is an outrageous shortcoming in the Bill and it is reasonable at this stage to park this legislation and get a better Bill.  We should hold on until we find out whether the current structures are at fault or if it was the fault of the personnel in positions of power — the culture rather than the architecture.  I cannot lend my support to the Bill on its current basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">There is no provision in the legislation providing a template for how we might deal in the future with failed banks.  It seems to be that either banks prosper and make profits and function, or if they fail the only recourse is for the State to step in and give a guarantee.  We have a system, for example, for other businesses, where a court officer may be appointed to see whether  the enterprise can trade its way out of difficulty.  It is a failing in this Bill, given what we have been through, that such a template is not being provided for as regards banks being in difficulty.  We are being asked, almost, to follow blindly the advice and the diktat of Government in this regard.  This House is just a rubber stamp, so off we go.  The new Central Bank reform structure just is not going to work.  The "same old same old" will not work in the future and that is why people are angry, want a changed system, more accountability, more questioning, more probing.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The director of AIB came before the Oireachtas and said he would rather die than face recapitalisation.  The Financial Regulator said he had stress tested our banks.  Everyone of them lied through their teeth and we were the patsies who were expected to accept all that, and look where it landed us.  We are not going to take the type of situation which pertained up to now any longer, and with good reason, because it has landed us in the mess we are in.  If the Minister does not recognise the folly of that and the fact that this Bill does not deal with this reality, then I am really worried.  It is in the context of being asked to buy a pig in a poke and follow blindly.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">If we knew then what we know now, would we have bought the Minister's line in respect of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and in particular, the guarantee?  Would we have extended that blanket coverage if we had known then what we now know as regards Anglo?  We were led to believe that its debt was in the region of €4 billion.  It is now €20 billion plus.  Can the Minister quantify that for us?  Irish Nationwide's was €1 billion, but it is now €2.5 billion or €2.7 billion.  What will the story be next week if we follow blindly, accept the Government's diktat, in the semblance of doing something and giving the impression we are in control of our destiny?  The appearance is that the shared wisdom of this House is involved in the formulating of new policy structures, etc., but it is not.  All backbenchers and Opposition Members are excluded from the process.  The Government knows best, and this is the approach that has led us to where we are.  I certainly have the gravest reservations in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Something has been brought to my attention, and I am not sure whether it is possible.  In the context of Anglo Irish Bank and the personal guarantees that were given, there is a rumour around this town that the shredding machine in respect of those guarantees is working overtime and that the people who may have signed up are now escaping scot free.  It is alarming if that is true and I cannot say I can substantiate this, but it is something for which I should like to get reassurances from the Minister, at whose behest the bank is now in State ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">When NAMA was established, its <i>quid pro quo</i> was that we should see credit flowing.  That has not happened and it is squeezing the lifeblood out of existing businesses from the viewpoint of working capital and securing existing jobs.  This has to be part of the strategy to get the economy going, to hold onto what we have.  I am talking mostly about small and medium-sized enterprises in rural Ireland, including the agricultural community who are finding it extraordinarily difficult.  They are being facilitated as regards the credit squeeze by their co-ops and their merchant stores who have over-extended themselves in many respects in this role, but the State has not responded in any meaningful manner in terms of getting credit up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">The Minister's credit review office is only window dressing, in its assertion to the effect that it will review whether a bank has treated someone fairly.  That will not get money flowing and the Minister needs to come into this House with a detailed plan to get capital to the business that can sustain existing jobs and create new ones.  I am of the view that the agricultural sector and agrifood businesses can create more jobs, but we need the proper framework, credit and a successful outcome to CAP negotiations in Europe.  However, that engine for recovery, agriculture and agrifood, can be significant in this regard.  It was interesting to hear last week the report commissioned by Bord Bia, identifying very significant potential in that sector, but it is crying out for credit, and the Minister's plan has not worked.  He needs a plan to get credit moving.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The hallmark of banking practice over the past ten or 15 years was the increasing downgrading of the role of local bank managers.  They might have some discretion as regards the approval of car loans or minor matters, but anything else, including mortgages, was effectively centralised.  This was to negate local knowledge as regards businesses that were viable, what the micro-economic realities were etc.  The knowledge which local bank managers and their staff had was written off in the interests of centralisation, and we know where that has led us.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">As regards the future of banking this is an issue that needs to be addressed.  The provision of funding for viable businesses is critical.  This competitive issue between banks' obligations to shareholders and the national economy must be addressed.  Excessively banks favour profit growing initiatives, paying enormous dividends to shareholders at the expense of the national interest and this must be examined in terms of reorganisation.   That is something that should be considered in terms of reorganisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">These are observations that the Minister may have heard before.  However, it is foolish to think we can draw conclusions about what failed and attempt to establish a new architecture for financial management in this country when we have not yet concluded our own banking inquiry.  Although the inquiry has been emasculated and engineered to deflect attention, none the less, it is wildly inappropriate to proceed with this Bill before its completion.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_742">I must say I did not notice, which is unlike me.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">In the course of this lengthy debate, Deputies have taken the opportunity to engage in a wide-ranging debate on the banking sector and the part it has played in the current economic difficulties we face.  That is understandable.  However, the focus of this Bill is somewhat narrower, and Deputies should appreciate this.  It is my intention to introduce a number of amendments on Committee Stage, details of which will be made available to Deputies in advance.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The contributors made a number of points about the Bill, which will be given careful consideration.  However, I must respond to some of the issues that have been raised.  There is one fundamental point which is of great importance in this debate but which has been overlooked by the Opposition speakers.  I find it extraordinary that neither of the main Opposition spokespersons made any reference in his or her contribution to the two persons who will head up the new structures: the regulator designate, Matthew Elderfield, and the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan.  Were I to have followed the advice proffered by Deputies Reilly and Creed at the conclusion of the debate, I would never have ensured these persons were appointed in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The whole purpose of the Bill is to put in place the structures on which the job descriptions of these two men are based.  Their appointments have brought an energy and professionalism that has already gone some distance in restoring confidence in our banking system both domestically and in international markets.  The bank is in the process of significantly increasing its staffing to ensure it has the necessary resources to carry out its functions appropriately.  These are important developments and they surely merit some reference from the Opposition finance spokespersons.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The purpose of this legislation is to give statutory vesture to appointments already made.  It has been suggested that somehow this legislation has been designed as the be-all and end-all in resolving the banking crisis.  It is not, and I did not introduce the Bill to the House on that basis.  However, it is important that these two appointments, which have commanded substantial confidence in Ireland and overseas, be underpinned by the necessary legislation, which at least gives them the job descriptions on the basis of which these persons were appointed.  This is important and everybody in the House should agree on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Of course, it has been characteristic of the banking crisis that we do not agree on very much in the House.  It is far more politically profitable to talk nonsense from the Opposition benches — some of the time, not all of the time — and make political capital than to face our problems with a clear eye and seek to resolve them.</p>

          <p eId="para_752">No.  I dealt with that, as the Deputy knows very well.  The Commission has stated since that reclassification that it has every confidence we have turned the corner.  Commissioner Rehn made that point last week, as the Deputy knows.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">Deputy Bruton and other Deputies raised a question about whether the causes of the financial crisis have been misdiagnosed as a failure of the regulatory architecture.  Again, I did not put forward such a proposition.  After many hours on the floor of this House picking through the causes and effects of the severe shock to the Irish economy arising from irresponsible practices in the financial sector, I can assure the Deputy that my view of the issues is considerably more complex and nuanced than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">However, it seems clear that — as a first step — a new beginning requires a refocusing of financial regulation through a single, unified structure.  It was on that basis that both Matthew Elderfield and Patrick Honohan were appointed to their positions.  I do not want any ambiguity about the powers, role or function of the Financial Regulator.  As we know, the former chief executive of the Office of the Financial Regulator retired in January 2009.  I do not believe it was viable for this country to defer an appointment pending the completion of a banking inquiry or of some hearing in this House about the suitability of a person for office.</p>

          <p eId="para_770">I will start working on a common purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Deputy Burton commented on the position of consumers under the new system.  I share the Deputy's concern that consumers were not always best served under the old arrangements and change is needed.  The Bill makes a number of important changes to integrate the protection of consumers of financial services into the Central Bank's core functions and into its reporting responsibilities, including the requirement to set up an advisory group on consumer interests.  I am open to further suggestions from Deputies on how we can ensure that financial regulation better protects consumers, especially those who are more vulnerable to mis-selling of unsuitable financial products.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The Deputy can take comfort from the Financial Regulator's statement before the joint committee that consumer protection remains a top priority in the new regulatory structure.  In the coming year, the consumer protection code and minimum competency requirements are to be reviewed and the regulator's team is moving immediately to ensure that the backlog of overcharging cases is resolved more quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Deputies also raised the need for a full investigation to provide a deeper understanding of the root causes of the systemic failure in our banking system.  The Government has committed to the establishment of a statutory commission to report by the end of the year and, as Deputies will be aware, the two preliminary investigations are due to be completed before the end of this month.  At the same time, other investigations by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda are under way; for obvious reasons, I do not propose to comment on these.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">On the question of whether holders of influential offices in financial institutions are well qualified or indeed fit to occupy their positions, I re-emphasise what I said at the start of this debate.  A key element of this Bill is the introduction of new powers for the bank to ensure the fitness and probity of nominees to key positions, including, where necessary, the holding of screening interviews with job candidates.  Such is the importance of the new provisions that I decided to include them in the present Bill rather than waiting for the next Bill, which will deal with regulatory functions and powers and will take into account decisions that are awaited at European level.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Deputy Sherlock raised concerns about the implementation of changes arising from the amendment to section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 which is provided for in the Bill.  The Deputy was in error in a number of his statements.  The policy decisions with regard to the changes proposed are matters decided by Government.  The Registrar of Credit Unions does not make policy.  There have been extensive consultations on the section 35 proposals.  The amendments contained in the Bill enable the registrar to impose requirements on credit unions with regard to their lending practices.  These include making provision for bad and doubtful debt, having a certain level of liquidity, and controls and reporting requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">I have already assured the House that the Registrar of Credit Unions will adopt a balanced and proportionate approach to the application of the loan provisioning requirements which are proposed.  In addition, transitional arrangements will be operated by the registrar, which will help ease the position for credit unions in the current financial year and the next financial year ending in September 2011.  They will also allow time for credit unions to adjust to the new regime.  There is a balance to be struck between meeting members' needs to reschedule loans and ensuring the stability of the credit union sector overall.  It is in the interests of every credit union in the country that the stability of the sector is safeguarded.  The proposals being brought forward in connection with the Bill will achieve this fundamental aim.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">During the debate, conflicting claims were made about the pace of legislative reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Deputy Upton appeared to suggest we were moving too slowly but, on the other hand, Deputy Kehoe claimed we are moving a little too fast.   In these circumstances, I suggest to the House that the Government must be getting the balance on this issue just about right.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The Central Bank recently announced a public consultation process on new corporate governance standards for banks and insurance companies.  The paper sets out minimum requirements as to how banks and insurance companies should organise the governance of their institutions, including membership of the board of directors, the role of the chairman and the operation of various board committees.  It is proposed that the requirements will apply to all credit institutions and insurers licensed or authorised by the regulator, including Irish licensed and authorised subsidiaries of international financial services groups.  My Department will examine the question of additional powers for the bank to introduce corporate governance requirements.  This will be done in the context of the second Bill on financial regulatory reform which, as I said in my opening speech, will be brought forward in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The absence of a role for the Oireachtas in the appointment of members of the proposed Central Bank commission or other senior positions within the new institutions was raised during the debate.  I ask Deputies to consider the proposition that the Executive, answerable for its actions to the Oireachtas and ultimately to the people, should retain the primary responsibility in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_798">The question of a bank resolution mechanism was also raised.  The global financial crisis has revealed the significant challenges that arise for countries when there is a necessity to deal quickly and effectively with distressed financial institutions.  Special resolution regimes for the financial sector are recognised as a key method of reducing the impact of the distress or failure of individual financial institutions.  For our part, I indicated in the course of the NAMA Bill debate that I would examine options for the introduction of a legislative regime to deal in a systematic way with distressed financial institutions.  The objective of such a regime would be to ensure that the State has in place a range of tools to protect deposit holders and ensure that problem institutions can be dealt with effectively in the interests of maintaining financial stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">In view of the central role performed by central banks in resolution frameworks for financial institutions, my Department is in consultation with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator with a view to the development of suitable options for progress in this area, including draft legislative proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">The work relating to the bank resolution issue is highly complex in character.  We have, for example, studied the United Kingdom legislation, which raises serious constitutional questions in this jurisdiction.  We have also looked at legislative models in other jurisdictions, with some of which fault has already been found.  We will get this right and we expect proposals to be brought forward early next year in that regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_803">Yes, early 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">I welcome the general consensus on the need for change.  However, I am acutely aware that there are different perspectives on financial regulatory reform.  I fully expect that before the ink is dry on these very necessary reforms, some Members will express fears that we are overreacting to the crisis and that the pendulum will swing too far towards over-regulation.  Indeed, I note that the leader of Fine Gael expressed such a view recently when he was reported as saying that NAMA was in danger of being overly heavy-handed in its regulation of builders and developers.  That is a curious perspective and a change from the charge that this side of the House invented NAMA to bail out the builders.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">To return to the Bill, I predict that the next line of argument will be that the new regime will deter investors and adversely affect job creation.  There are already voices on Wall Street telling US reformers that they will scare business away to London.</p>

          <p eId="para_814">In London, regulators are being told that they will frighten investors away to Geneva, and so on.  However, the truth is that we are looking at an international reform movement intent on instilling high standards and preventing opportunistic regulatory arbitrage.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">In this, I share the views expressed by President Obama in his recent address making the case for regulatory reform.  A strong, well-resourced and independently-minded regulator is an integral part of any modern and complex economy.  It provides reassurance to those investing and working in Ireland that there is no competitive disadvantage to playing a straight game and it provides the necessary stability to foster economic growth and public trust.  Indeed a strong, well-respected and well-resourced regulatory system has the capacity to give us a competitive advantage in attracting financial services to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">This Bill is essential to the work already embarked upon by the regulator and the new chairman of the Central Bank.  It will provide us with a robust structure and I commend it to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_971">I think the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs is looking after us this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">While we fully agree with the need to boost long-term competitiveness on the issue of wind energy, the location of wind farms is of great concern to the people of my constituency of Longford-Westmeath and the entire country.  It is, however, necessary to give consideration to this issue from a planning point of view.  When we consider the tourist implications of unsightly pylons and blades, it is extremely important that location is taken into account.  We should not locate wind farms so that they may be a blight on the landscape.  We should not locate them within a densely populated area, nor where they will cause noise pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">I would have liked the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to be present on this issue.  A disturbing statistic is that 80% of materials for wind farms are imported, I am told, from China.  It would make good economic sense to develop a factory to manufacture those products in Ireland, and I would welcome its location in Longford-Westmeath which would give much needed employment to a constituency that has over 15,000 people unemployed.  It is something that the Minister should look at.  I have been criticising him and the Government in this House over the lack of employment opportunities in my constituency.  This is something that should be kick-started in the midlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">Over the years, planners have had extraordinary powers of personal discretion on granting or refusing permissions resulting in many inconsistencies, injustices and bad planning in all areas.  We must protect the culture and heritage of rural areas for the local people.  Without people in a rural community, such communities will wither and die.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The Government's national bio-fuels strategy has been a failure because proper planning did not go into the project.  It does not surprise me coming from this Government.  Having set a target of achieving a 4% bio-fuels rate by this year, it has in reality only reached less than a quarter of this figure.  So much for planning and strategy by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_992">That is all right.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">As previous speakers have stated, this Bill will introduce a bio-fuel obligation in Ireland.  Under the terms of the legislation, an initial bio-fuel penetration rate of 4% is being set, with this to be increased over time in line with EU targets and further commitments on climate change and energy security.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">This legislation marks a significant step forward for Ireland.  From the date of the introduction of the obligation, 1 July 2010, all petrol and diesel on sale in this country will include at least 4% bio-fuel.  This means that within the first year of the operation of the obligation some 220 million litres of fossil fuels will be substituted with bio-fuels.  This penetration is expected to increase to over 500 million litres by 2020, in line with EU regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">As the House will be aware, the bio-fuel obligation will be administered by the National Oil Reserves Agency on behalf of the State.  Its introduction follows movement at European level, in particular the introduction and approval of the renewable energy directive by the EU Commission in 2008.  This directive has set out mandatory targets for bio-fuel penetration in road transport fuels within the EU of 10% by 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">It is vital that the bio-fuel obligation comes into force, as planned, on 1 July 2010.  Any delay in the implementation date of the bio-fuel obligation would have a severe and negative effect on Ireland's burgeoning bio-fuel sector, which is one of the areas identified for growth.  I hope, therefore, this will experience a quick passage through Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">The bio-fuel obligation will help the market for biodiesel in Ireland to grow, and this will be good for the development of a strong, indigenous bio-fuels sector.  It is worth mentioning here the development in County Wexford operated by GBI.  The company met some of us some time ago.  It is very impressive and its achievement should be recognised.  The company has a state-of-the-art bio-diesel facility, employs 22 people and has the capacity to grow further as the market expands.  This legislation is important for the company.  It will not only present it with further opportunity but, I hope, also attract other investors in the market to which I will refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">The introduction of this bio-fuel obligation is good for Ireland's environment.  Like all European Union countries, Ireland has agreed to reduce carbon emissions as part of its international environmental commitments.  An important step towards reaching our goals in this regard will be to increase the use of sustainable and renewable energies, including bio-fuels.  This new obligation will take a considerable amount of fossil fuels out of our vehicle engines and replace them with green and renewable energy.  The introduction of this bio-fuel obligation will lessen Ireland's dependence on the importation of fuels.  Bio-fuels are being manufactured in Ireland and by producing these fuels at home we are helping to make Ireland more energy-independent.  This is vital for our country which is currently dependent to a large extent on the importation of various forms of energy from overseas and is, therefore, at risk should the supply of these energy sources be compromised.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">Investing in renewable energy sources such as the production of bio-fuels offers Ireland a considerable opportunity for growing an indigenous bio-fuel sector and for generating employment within this sector.  Green Biofuels Ireland uses waste materials to manufacture a renewable diesel substitute which is then distributed through the forecourts to the consumer, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving Ireland's security of fuel supplies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">The market in Ireland is not attractive to operators.  I support a biodiesel project operating successfully in Argentina.  I have copies of the agreement between the company and the Government of Argentina.  The difference between Argentina and Ireland is that the price is guaranteed in Argentina.  As the price fluctuates, the farmer will receive a certain amount of profit for his product.  Currently, the price in Argentina is $28 per tonne of biodiesel delivered and this is the price guaranteed to the grower, irrespective of fluctuation in price.  Farmers know the price they will  receive and the refinery knows the profit it can and must make.  This system works very well.  The project is being led by a former Munster rugby prop, Federico Pucciarello,who left Ireland a year ago.  He would like to undertake the same project in Ireland but the figures do not add up.  The Minister of State may not be aware that a group in Foynes also spent two years trying to set up a first-generation project but the figures did not add up.  I welcome this project but we have a long way to go before we have a dynamic bio-fuel industry in this country, unless the Government is willing to intervene.  This Bill provides a framework but we have a long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">The Minister has promised to table an amendment on Committee Stage which will have significant implications for one company in particular, Endesa Ireland Limited.  I have an interest in Endesa and so also should the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, as it has plants in both our constituencies.  Endesa has plants in Tarbert and in Great Island.  It purchased the plants at the top of the market price and paid €450 million.  It is prepared to invest another €0.5 billion in converting both plants to gas.  However, this Bill could penalise the company if the Minister goes ahead with his proposed amendment.  Along with other Members, I have received a briefing from Endesa.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">The Minister proposes to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to impose a levy on electricity generators in respect of windfall profits derived from the free allocation carbon allowances, EUAs, European Union allowances.  Endesa Ireland is concerned that the levy to reclaim windfall profits will also affect those that have not enjoyed windfall profits, namely, Endesa Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">As part of the asset strategy agreement between the ESB and CER, the ESB divested 1,068 MW of generation plant which had been purchased by Endesa Ireland when the economy was at its peak.  The company probably paid €200 million over the odds but the country benefited considerably from this purchase.  As part of the package, Endesa Ireland purchased the EUAs allocated to these stations and the rights to future allocations in the period 2008 to 2012, valued at 2008 spot price.  Since 2008, the value of the EUAs has fallen, meaning Endesa Ireland has suffered a loss relating to the EUAs rather than the windfall profits enjoyed by all the other generation companies in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">Endesa Ireland is looking to make significant investments — €500 million — in its stations in Great Island and Tarbert, bringing much-needed jobs to those regions.  Its ability to invest is diminished with each additional reduction in its income.  The projected incomes from the existing units have fallen significantly since Endesa's purchase of the stations.  The introduction of an emissions levy when Endesa is not profiting from any profits on its EUAs would further reduce these incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Endesa Ireland considers that the levy should not apply to its stations as it has not enjoyed the windfall profits as received by all other generation companies in the country.  The company is of the view that the legislation deals unfairly with it and asks that it not be treated unfairly.  Such a levy will further reduce its income and this might affect its future plans to invest in Ireland.  The board of the company will probably take a very poor view of what has happened.  The company bought at the height of the market and would be discouraged by this imposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">The Minister's amendment should be drafted in such a way as to take account of circumstances where ownership of an installation changes hands and market value has been paid to the original recipient in respect of the corresponding EUAs.  Given that Endesa Ireland's existing units are old and inefficient, they are not scheduled to run in the market.  Generally these units run only when EirGrid needs them due to changes in wind patterns to support wind power generation, congestion in the network or line outages.  These stations are used to provide critical support to the system.  If the legislation were drafted so that the levy only applied to generation units that were included in the market schedule by the single electricity market operator, Endesa Ireland could be largely exempted from it.  I hope the Minister will take this into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Endesa Ireland purchased all the carbon allowances, EUAs, allocated to its stations from the ESB as part of the competition organised by the ESB to divest some of its assets.  The competition rules required the participants to include a separate line item setting out the value for the 2008 carbon emissions allowances that was included.  The 2009-2012, EUAs, were valued at the expected market rate of €25 per tonne at the time and included in the total offer.  Since taking ownership of the assets, the value of the EUAs has fallen, so rather than a windfall gain, Endesa Ireland has suffered a loss.  EUA prices are now around €12 per tonne compared with the €25 per tonne that Endesa paid to ESB.  If any company has enjoyed windfall assets, it is the ESB.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">Endesa Ireland is seeking to make significant investment, approximately €500 million, in generation stations in Great Island, County Cork, and Tarbert, County Kerry, bringing much needed jobs to the areas.  Converting the Tarbert station to gas would create 300 jobs over two years.  It would also ensure the provision of a gas pipeline from Foynes to Tarbert, bringing a natural gas supply to the county for the first time, either through Bord Gáis or Shannon LNG.  A plant like Kerry Group's Kerry Ingredients, employing 700 people in Listowel, County Kerry, would have its energy bills reduced considerably.  The Minister must examine Endesa's case for an exemption from the levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">The 2009 Endesa's running hours were 50% less than 2008 and in 2010 they are expected to fall by half again.  The capacity payment was reduced by 15% from 2008 to 2009 and this too is expected to fall further in 2010.  The introduction of an emissions levy would further reduce Endesa's income.  This levy is seeking to recover windfall profits which it has not enjoyed.  I hope the Minister will consider Endesa's unique position in this regard.  There should be a level playing field for all companies in this area and none of them should be penalised by this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">This legislation is the start in moving over to bio-fuels.  To make up the other 6% target by 2020, most of the fuel will have to be imported unless incentives are put in place by the Government to ensure it is profitable for Irish operators, such as Wexford-based Green Biofuels Ireland Limited, to come into the market .</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">Endesa's unique position is recognised by Deputy Simon Coveney, Opposition energy spokesperson.  I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, also has an interest in the company's position considering Great Island is in her constituency.  I hope the Minister will continue to meet with Endesa's representatives and work out some solution to the levy.</p>

        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_555">
          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1012">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  Any measure to improve environmental protection must be welcomed.  There is a view that this is a Green Party Bill but all parties in the House are green because they all support improving more environmental friendly approaches to energy production and consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">JHM Crops Limited, based in Adare, County Limerick, along with experts from the University of Limerick, was the pioneer in introducing the energy crop miscanthus into the country.  Miscanthus can be used by peat-burning electricity stations.  In January 2009, miscanthus crop-growing companies were informed by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that a renewable energy feed-in-tariff price would be announced by January 2010.  This would enable the miscanthus product to be able to compete with peat for use in peat-burning stations.  Therefore, peat could be replaced with a highly efficient, environmentally friendly material.  It could facilitate competition or a partial replacement.  If the development were to take place as promised, it would represent a great boost to the industry and to the suppliers and farmers who grow the crop.  At present, some 5,000 acres are grown nationally but that could expand exponentially if the power station market were opened up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">Interestingly, some 10% of the national crop is grown in my constituency in Limerick.  A commitment was given by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that an announcement would be made on the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, price by last January.  This was promised at a meeting held on 2 December 2009.  The REFIT price is crucial for the survival of the miscanthus business in Ireland.  In excess of 5,000 acres have been planted.  The scheme pays the ESB and Bord na Móna a special price for electricity produced from biomass such as miscanthus.  The scheme makes it viable for those in the industry to help the Government achieve its aim of 30% biomass co-firing in peat power stations by 2015.  This is an excellent opportunity for the Government to achieve the objectives it set out.  Failing an announcement very soon, everyone involved, including the developers, manufacturers and growers of the product, will be put in a very difficult position.  The industry is relying on the promise made by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources upon the announcement of the REFIT scheme and it has put considerable investment into the supply chain to deliver miscanthus to peat-fueled power stations.  Investment has already taken place on the basis of the promise given by the Department.  Everything is in place to deliver miscanthus immediately and the industry is waiting for the REFIT price to be announced.  Uncertainty is crippling the business and the industry in general.  I understand some miscanthus is used already in peat-fueled power stations at a loss of between €38 and €39 per tonne.  I suggest the proposal is viable and can operate in an efficient manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">The proposed approach to the power stations is part of the much heralded green economy.  It has significant potential and simply requires a relatively small amount of support to succeed.  The alternative is to forget about using indigenous biomass and to import fuel to meet the 2015 goals, leaving the State without security of supply.  During the next five years we will have an opportunity to ensure that in reaching our target we supply the product from native sources with consequential benefits for the economy, job creation, farmers and the agricultural industry which produces the crop.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">In concert with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the miscanthus business in Ireland has emerged from the research and development stage to early demonstration.  At this stage it is essential to establish solid end-use markets for the growing yields of miscanthus in 2010 and beyond and to develop the number of acres grown with consequential benefits for the growers, the economy and job creation through the manufacture of the final product.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">I refer to JHM Crops based in Adare, County Limerick.  It has taken a lead in each stage of the miscanthus expansion in Ireland and the end use of the produce has been no exception in this regard.  The company has researched markets that expressed interest in the product for heat, horse bedding and the building of processing plants for growers of miscanthus.  Such processing and power plants are not pipe dreams but real tangible projects that will be up and running by the middle of this year with promised Government support.  Such support should involve the inclusion of miscanthus in the ReHeat programme which has been delayed as well as the delay in the announcement of the REFIT price.  The company has also undertaken a rapid expansion in the selling of miscanthus logs which has gone from strength to strength and will be rolled out on a national basis during the course of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">These markets will develop off the back of a large end-user, affording the industry confidence that demand and supply are secure.  The large end-users were to be the peat power stations referred to in the bio-energy action plan.  The failure to announce the REFIT price for electricity produced from biomass such as miscanthus is a major factor affecting the industry.  The miscanthus business is ready and all aspects of the supply chain are in place to deliver to power stations immediately.  However, a viable price must be paid by power stations and passed on to farmers for growing the crop.  Given due attention to the demand side through the announcement of the REFIT price and other supports in the form of grants for pilot schemes for processing and commercial heat plants, there will be growth in the market in the short term leading to solid viability in the long term.  The industry will then reach a stage at which it could take advantage of the progress being made by miscanthus for bio-fuel.  I refer to examples of upgrading from oil to biodiesel and others involving water treatment and fertiliser.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">One advantage to Departments and agencies willing to lend support to the miscanthus industry is that it is a proven feed stock for boilers and power stations.  It is not a new, untested energy crop.  Austria has been burning miscanthus for more than 15 years without cause for complaint.  Drax in the UK has been confident enough in its use of miscanthus to commission three new biomass plants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">The industry was confident that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources would add miscanthus to the renewable energy feed-in tariff scheme but, unfortunately, this has not taken place.  Support from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is crucial for the industry as well.  The Department should establish grants that attract interest from farmers and companies.  They could work closely with all Departments and agencies to achieve a strong biomass market to ensure clean, secure heat and power together with jobs in rural areas, which have had little good news recently.  The industry supports farmers by encouraging them to take the lead and to take ownership of projects.  All that is needed is the support to get demonstration projects off the ground and then the existing significant interest will mushroom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">JHM Crops in Adare has been the pioneer at each stage of expansion in the miscanthus market with a vast range of projects instigated and supported by the company.  It has carried out research on best practice in regard to growing, harvesting and processing, as well as in-depth research on potential market opportunities.  This gives the company a competitive advantage over possible rivals but it has pointed out that it has been quite cost intensive to rely on its own resources.  In the current climate, the opportunity now exists for a Department or agency, with all the resources available, to take ownership of progressing the miscanthus and biomass markets further.  JHM Crops has said that its wealth of experience and expertise in the sector will be available to advise and assist.  However, without an immediate announcement by the Government on the REFIT price, the market will never take off and proposed projects will have no foundation on which to build.  If the REFIT announcement is made, Ireland has a great chance of becoming a European leader in the miscanthus and biomass industry, putting us on the road to a low-carbon economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Most people do not understand what biomass is because it is a minority crop but one that offers an enormous opportunity for development.  Miscanthus, also known as elephant grass, is a fast growing, perennial, woody-type grass that originated in south-East Asia.  Already familiar as a flowering plant, the non-flowering forms are of interest agriculturally as they grow rapidly, have low nutrient requirements, produce high yields, suffer from no known pests or diseases, are environmentally friendly and may be harvested every year after the first two years.  The energy crop grows to a height of 2.5 m to 3 m and is harvested in cane form every spring.  Once established, the crop does not require fertilisers, disease control or weed control.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">This low level of maintenance together with the fact that it remains in the ground for a minimum of 15 to 20 years, yielding a crop every year after the initial two years, has made it a popular choice with farmers.  It has been shown to be well suited as an energy crop to the Irish climate and soils, and a minimum yield of six to seven tonnes per acre can be achieved from the fourth year onward.  Mr. John Clifton-Brown of Trinity College Dublin, an expert on miscanthus, sees parts of Ireland as having the most suitable conditions in the world for growing miscanthus.  Miscanthus is one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly means of producing sustainable biomass for renewable energy and other markets.  It produces biomass three times more efficiently than wheat, yielding a quality product that can be used across a range of markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">With more stringent environmental regulations and biodiversity laws coming on stream in the coming years, energy crops such as miscanthus provide farmers who require a steady return from their land with an alternative land use option.  We have heard much from Government agencies and non-governmental organisations on the importance of using carbon-neutral fuels in the era of the Kyoto Protocol and the Copenhagen climate change summit.  Miscanthus is a carbon negative source of energy, a net carbon sequester.  This is achieved through two mechanisms.  Leaf, which represents in excess of 30% of dry matter and the majority of the nutrients, falls to the ground during senescence where it composts returning the carbon to the soil.  In addition, the fibrous root structure which can extend up to 1 m into the soil during the growing season dies off during senescence and represents deep recalcitrant carbon in the soil.  Therefore, as an energy crop, miscanthus offers exceptional carbon savings.  Put together, the high yield, low labour cost and carbon negative nature of the crop make miscanthus an attractive energy crop for Irish farmers to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">I am making the case for the immediate promotion of miscanthus production at a crucial stage in the development of the product itself and of the market for that product.  Experience on the Continent shows it is a crop suitable for use in power generating stations.  Although I stand to be corrected on this, a source tells me that Bord na Móna supplies peat to power stations at no cost to the ESB.  I ask that support be given to farmers who grow miscanthus so that they can compete in the market.  We are asking for the support promised to the industry on 9 December 2009.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_1026">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  We must provide as many alternatives to oil as possible.  The Bill is a response to the European Union directive which stipulates that 10% of transport fuel must be supplied from renewable resources by 2020.  This is an opportunity for us to engage in the direct production of bio-fuels.  Unfortunately, it seems that, at least initially, we will be replacing imported oil or gas with imported bio-fuel produced either in Europe or possibly even in South America.  Some of my colleagues, including Deputy Neville, have gone into the technicalities of the Bill in great detail.  I propose to focus on the question of how we are using the opportunities available to us to provide Irish-produced products.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">I recently carried out an examination of what was happening to waste plastic in the State only to find that the vast majority is being transported all the way to China instead of being turned into oil for use at home.  I was pleased to see in a recent press report that Cynar Recycling Limited in Portlaoise has opened a plant costing €6 million to turn mixed plastic into a synthetic fuel and intends to build further plants across Europe.  Its Irish plant will require only 3,000 tonnes of plastic initially.  According to Government figures, 50,000 tonnes of waste plastic comes from the waste recycling groups annually.  The system proposed by Cynar has been in operation elsewhere for several years.  For instance, the PlastOil plant in Switzerland is using 10,000 tonnes per annum having been in operation on a commercial basis for the last three years.  This system is proven and is just one example of how we can better use our waste in order to supply alternative energy and provide employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">We must examine as an issue of priority how the bio-fuel industry is structured and supported in other countries across the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">Last year the sub-committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Association produced an in-depth study of different forms of alternative energy.  One of our most interesting trips was not to Switzerland or anywhere like that, but to Donegal and Derry.  On one side of the Border, in Derry, the industry is viable and workable, and waste from the city is used to generate the necessary forests and plants to provide the energy.  We must question why we are not using the same mechanisms here.  We visited units in Donegal, and they were finding the situation much more difficult.  There was much less support available.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">We must, as a priority, examine how different countries throughout the European Union support the necessary structures to allow alternative energies such as biomass to work.  It is strange that there are different support structures in a supposed Common Market.  There is one approach in Germany, another in France and yet another in Denmark and Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">My colleague, Deputy Simon Coveney, spoke at length on the Bill.  He said Ireland should be brave enough not to go the same way as the UK, even if it caused problems on the Border such as fuel smuggling.  I warn Deputy Coveney that I have a fairly strong knowledge of the problems that smuggling causes on the Border.  For the past 40 years, the washing and smuggling of fuel across the Border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic has been significant and was ignored for too long.  I would not like any structures to be put in place that would encourage that type of thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">As someone who lives in County Monaghan, I note that tillage farming is not a possibility there.  Deputy Dan Neville and other Members mentioned some of the crops that can be grown, but those would not be suitable for the Cavan-Monaghan area.  However, there is a great opportunity in the tillage areas in the midlands and the south to produce and manufacture ethanol in this country.  That would need some European support or a change in structures to ensure it would be viable.  We cannot go on indefinitely depending on sugar cane from South America or other places.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">We need to proceed with caution.  We should double-check how other countries organise vibrant and profitable bio-fuel production operations involving farmers and local businesses.  It is vital that the Minister makes certain that whatever is needed to ensure that Ireland produces its own bio-fuel is dealt with before the Bill is finalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">The fact that we import 95% of all the gas and oil we use makes us very vulnerable in any situation.  If something were to happen to the gas pipelines at Moffat in Scotland, for instance, we could be left without gas or electricity.  There is no doubt the price of oil will increase significantly, especially if there is any increase in world trade.  In that context it is vital we use any energy we can produce at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">In the years when the country believed there was plenty of money and we did not need to utilise our own resources, I questioned the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Joe Walsh, on the logic of paying for the storage and exportation of our meat and bone meal to Germany where it was used in biomass plants to produce cheap energy.  If any effort had been made, that product could have been utilised with very little effort in some of our existing electricity power stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">To that end we must consider why biomass plants — especially anaerobic digesters — are in place on farms all over Europe, in countries such as Germany.  Under the present regulations in this country, such plants are not viable.  That is due to lack of any grant support and more especially to lack of access to the electricity grid at a reasonable price.  Some of those issues are not directly related to the Bill, but they are all relevant to meeting our EU obligations on energy and carbon.  I urge the Minister to re-examine the access and support systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">When the British-Irish Parliamentary Association examined the situation, the results were startling.  There is a need to reconsider how we can utilise energy produced in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">In my own county, poultry is a major issue.  I tried for 12 years or so, with the help of others, to get a biomass plant going there.  However, there were all sorts of objections on the basis that the plant contained an incinerator.  Some of that poultry litter is now being pressed in Northern Ireland and sent to a similar plant in Scotland — the type of plant I wanted built just outside Monaghan town.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">Some of us, although we are not members of the Green Party, have had those ideas for years.  I started my efforts at Government level in Brussels approximately 13 years ago.  We got the funds out of Brussels eventually.  However, we met with objections from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in Ireland.  The Department owned a site outside Monaghan town, and agreed that would be the site for the biomass plant when it got the go-ahead.  However, when we got the go-ahead, the Department said the site — and all its property — had been sold.  If the Minister went to that site on the Armagh road outside Monaghan today, he would see that not one inch of the area concerned has been sold or utilised since.  It was not just local objections that prevented the plant being built, but lack of effort at Government level at that time to see the project through.  That is just one example.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">In Cavan, we are faced with a major issue regarding Quinn Insurance Limited.  In one way, that is irrelevant to this discussion, but it is relevant in other ways.  There are massive pig units throughout County Cavan, and major problems will arise for them in the next 12 to 18 months when the nitrate regulations become tighter.  I beg the Minister to re-examine the situation and consider how those units can be supported to put in anaerobic digesters of the type that are being used throughout Europe, so they will be financially viable.  The problems are the lack of grant money, and the difficulties involved in linking up to the Electricity Supply Board and getting a proper return from it for the surplus energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">Each unit can do three things.  It can utilise the waste that is produced — which should be used as fertiliser, but that is not allowed under regulations.  It can produce homegrown energy, and it can produce some jobs, which are badly needed in that area.  I urge the Minister to re-examine the systems that are in place.  I know the issue is not relevant to the Bill, but we have to think beyond the bend at present to ensure that structures are in place to produce an industry, lower the carbon problems and get the issue going.  The carbon tax, introduced a week or ten days ago, has serious consequences for farmers.  I ask the Minister to consider how it might be dealt with in a positive and constructive way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_1042">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Bill, which presents Ireland, an agricultural country, with many opportunities.  It has many welcome features.  If the legislation is properly handled and if proper support mechanisms are put in place, it could be successful.  However, I have concerns about it and hope the Minister will address them.  Perhaps some are invalid but they are concerns nevertheless.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">The Labour Party issued a paper entitled "Biofuels — A Reassessment" that expresses great concern over the effects of bio-fuels, particularly the increase in food prices, in the developing world.  Will the Minister address this concern?</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">This legislation is placing an obligation on certain people and I am concerned about this.  It is supposed that our approach would be a failure were it not for the fact that we are including an element of compulsion to achieve our modest goals.  I welcome that there is to be a reduction from 5.8% to 4% in the required bio-fuel content of transport fuel.  Essentially, we are talking about the effects of bio-fuels in the transport sector alone.  That a further levy is being imposed through this Bill is unacceptable.  Deputy Crawford said that, only last week or the week before, the Minister levied a carbon tax at a rate of 8.7% on agricultural diesel and heating fuels and imposed a tax at a rate of 4.4% on auto-diesel in particular.  Despite this, a week later the Minister is responsible for a further levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">It is odd that, on foot of this Bill, the people who are to be administering and regulating the imposition of the levy are those who are directly involved in the oil industry.  This is in spite of the considerable bureaucracy that seems to exist in this area.  I refer to administration, licensing, monitoring, guaranteeing that the proper mix will be used and the compelling of the relevant parties in the industry in this regard.  Compulsion is a backward step.  There should be an incentive rather than compulsion in many cases to achieve national targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The Minister has a far greater opportunity than that under discussion to reduce carbon emissions, yet the Government has failed to compel ESB Networks to allow operators to realise the potential of wind-generated renewable energy in the west.  I refer in particular to the area I know best in County Galway.  By tapping into this resource, we would lower our dependence on fossil fuels, which are largely imported.</p>

          <p eId="para_1068">The Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, should be very favourably disposed to intervening in respect of groups such as BirdWatch Ireland.  Only this week a major project was stifled and delayed, at a huge additional cost to the developers and in spite of the fact that the local authority had recognised as very favourable the potential of the project to bring jobs to the area and increase supply.  There is already a deficit in County Galway at large.  Birdwatch Ireland has made an unbelievable objection to a simple proposal that has already received planning permission.  The company in question, in order to comply with the need to show greater consideration for the environment, has agreed to reduce the number of turbines by approximately 30%.  Naturally, that will necessitate reinvestment and the site plan will have to be altered.  It is prepared to do that but the project is being stifled anyway.  There is an absolute urgency in this regard.  I welcome and support what the Minister is trying to do with regard to bio-fuel.  The most important thing is to point out that there is an alternative at his fingertips.  It could bring far greater benefit to the country.  I ask him to consider it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_1071">I appreciate that very much.  We have had various experiments and pilot schemes with regard to the production of alternative fuel products and crops.  People embarked favourably on such schemes.  They invested heavily in various crop projects.  The sowing in the spring was one thing, but their confidence had gone by the time of the harvest.  They had to burn and scorch the ground of what they had intended as an enhancement to their income.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">Many Deputies who have spoken on this Bill have referred to alternative ways of using our land.  That would be very welcome because over the last three years there has been a substantial decline in areas of agriculture like cereal production, crop production and dairying.  I refer to activities on which farmers depend for their livelihoods.  They are getting fed up.  Over the last two years, the climate has had a major effect on them.  Cereal and other crops have been lost as a result of frost, etc.  The Minister and his Government colleagues cannot do anything about that, although it is possible that a reduction in carbon emissions would bring our climate back into a more stable situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">If we are to ask farmers to adopt alternative land uses — to encourage individuals to make a significant investment in the production of these crops — there will have to be an absolute guarantee of a market for such produce at the end of the day.  Individual farmers will not be able to go through the entire production process without some sort of guarantee.  The agriculture industry currently benefits from various EU crop production guarantees and support mechanisms.  We had beef mountains and wine lakes, etc., in the past when products were produced excessively in the EEC.  If the bio-fuel sector is to be introduced into this country, why can we not divert some of the existing EU support mechanisms into that sector?  I ask the Minister to investigate the possibility of such a transfer to assist those who intend to move from traditional crops to crops in this area.  It would be important.  It is obvious that the move to a new blend of bio-fuels — I refer primarily to auto diesel, etc. — will necessitate additional expenditure by those involved.  Will there be some sort of recognition of the costs which are entailed in adjusting engines and degrees of horse power to facilitate to the greater use of bio-fuels in the transport sector?</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">We have been told that 98% of fuels used in Irish transport are imported.  We can reduce that figure because we have an alternative.  That is why I cannot understand the focus on one aspect of this issue.  As I see it, the bureaucracy in this Bill, as presented, will make it difficult for it to be implemented satisfactorily.  That could be eliminated by using alternative sources of transport.  I refer to rail transport, rather than road transport, for example.  We are very lucky in this sense.  It is fair to say that the Government has delivered part of a new railway line in the west of Ireland.  There is a commitment in Transport 21 to continue that project.  The reality of what is happening on the ground is that forestry products from counties Mayo and Galway generally go through Dublin to get to Waterford by rail.  If the railway line is continued to Claremorris, as we hope it will be — the next leg of the project, from Athenry to Tuam, could start tomorrow morning — that freight traffic could be diverted from the Dublin-Waterford railway line.  It could instead be brought to Limerick and across to Waterford, using the west and south coast railway lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">We need to get real about some of these things.  There are alternatives in a series of areas.  I will finish on this point.  I welcome the start we are making.  A report produced by the EPA in 2008 states that the introduction of bio-fuels leads to "reduced dependency on oil and a reduction in the environmental impacts of transport and, in particular, greenhouse gas emissions".  It claims that bio-fuels "can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy security, while yielding national and local economic benefits".  It summarises the whole idea that underpins this legislation.  I wish these concepts were supported by other things the Minister could do, with his Government colleagues, to ensure there is far greater use of renewable sources of energy.  Such an approach would immediately reduce our dependence on imports and increase the security of our energy supply.  A fortnight ago, the House debated the complications and difficulties that might exist in less peaceful times than we have at the moment.</p>

I welcome its introduction in the House as it gives us an opportunity to discuss the concerns of the general public in this regard.  Many people would like to do something about the alternative forms of energy that are available in this country.  This issue affects individuals and industries around the country.  When I visited the Bulmers cider plant in Clonmel some weeks ago, I discussed with management the issues and problems being faced by this old established employer.  It produces a very saleable product at its modern plant, which is one of the finest facilities of its kind in the world.  The first and most problematic difficulty that was mentioned by management was the cost of energy. The manager said if the company could control the cost of energy, it would guarantee the future of the plant for many years.  When one examines this issue, the first question one must ask is whether the company has considered alternative energy but he replied it was too costly.  What will the Government do for companies such as Bulmers in Clonmel?  At the same time as introducing the legislation, the Government has imposed a carbon tax——</p>

          <p eId="para_1083">On a point of order, I would like the Deputy to pass on a message to the manufacturer.  I intend on Committee Stage to include provisions that will help companies to keep their prices low and competitive and to retain jobs in Clonmel and elsewhere.  I hope the Deputy will bring that good news to the company to show what is being done in the House through the legislation to help them out.</p>

          <p eId="para_1096">The price of milk and beef is increasing but farmers are in huge debt because they lost fortunes over the past few years.  The Government should help them.  The Minister has a duty to consider the hardship he is imposing on people.  I spoke to an oil supplier in recent weeks who said he cannot collect money because customers do not have it.  However, the Minister then decides to add another tax which has made the bills bigger and harder to pay.  He is not living in the real world.  I reiterate my invitation to him to visit my constituency at his earliest convenience to listen to what people are saying in Bulmers of Clonmel and Tipperary co-operatives and to agricultural contractors who have almost gone to the wall because of the huge imposition that the carbon tax is on their business.</p>

          <p eId="para_1100">Alternative energies are good in theory.  It is better to develop alternative energy sources rather than import fuel.  If we could produce our own energy, we would be better off.  For example, Bord Gáis proposes to create a significant number of jobs through wind farms, which is welcome.  However, people will be up in arms because some wind farms have been built too close to private dwellings.  The Minister should send guidelines to planners in local authorities to ensure such farms are not constructed too close to private dwellings.  A number of regions would benefit from these farms but we have all attended public meetings where fear and concern has been expressed about wind farms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">The same issue has been raised in County Meath regarding the erection of overhead wires.  It was reported recently in the newspaper it would cost X amount to bury them underground.  Why could they not be buried if such a long-term investment is being made?  The Minister needs to bring the public with him regarding alternative energy projects.  There is not public confidence in wind farms and in one instance when planning permission was granted for a wind farm, the people behind the project applied for a bigger farm before the first one was built.  That does not instil confidence in the local community.</p>

          <p eId="para_1105">The explanatory memorandum refers to the transport of bulky biomass around the country and states trains could be used.  That could be important because it would be a way to improve the use of the railways and it should be encouraged.</p>

I refer to some of the points I made about the carbon tax and the difficulties associated with it.  It is important that we do a good public relations job when we send out the message about alternative energy.  We must educate people on why it is being done and why it is a benefit to the economy in the long term.  I welcome the discussion on the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1110">It is debate in the proper way.  There is not a monopoly or ownership on the switch we have to make.  We all understand the sense of this, that if we do not do it we are leaving the country exposed, and if we do it we can help out the farming community.  I see farmers as being probably the most important group in making the switch towards a more indigenous fossil fuel system, with wind power, biomass and fuel crops.  We are on a similar line on that.  The issue is how one best does it.  That requires political support as well.  We need to make difficult decisions that might not be popular.  It will be difficult to build the electricity grid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">I could spend all my time talking to Deputy Tom Hayes.  Putting lines underground might seem the most attractive option, which we will do wherever we can because of the landscape and other benefits, but in certain instances it is not technically possible and would not be desirable for a range of reasons.  Crucially, for the people of this country, especially in rural areas, if we do not build the grid there will not be any jobs.  I do not mean there will not be any jobs at all but none of the modern jobs that come from factories provided by foreign direct investment.  That is what has helped rural Ireland tremendously in the past 30 or 40 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">In my mother's town of Macroom a series of factories set up on the edge of the town.  They need good quality electricity.  I refer to big investments such as modern bio-pharma, biomedical devices, ICT and data centres.  They need a rock solid guarantee that they will have power.  They cannot afford for the system to collapse.  A data centre cannot be allowed to go down.  Likewise, the ovens in a bio-pharmacy plant cannot be allowed to cool down.  Often one needs two electricity connection points on either side so that if one goes down, one has a backup.  In order to do that one needs a grid.  It is not easy or popular to do that but it is important.  Some people say "Yes, we should make the switch" but at the same time they do not want us to put in the grid, but that will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">I wish to refer to some of the other contributions that have been made in concluding the Second Stage discussion of the Bill.  I thank Deputies from all sides of the House who have contributed to the debate.  I have listened with interest to the points raised and I will take them into account as we move on to Committee Stage.  Bio-fuels will play a central role in meeting our binding European Union targets for 2020, and in so doing, greatly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy security and help the agricultural sector to diversify into new areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">We must strike a balance between taking advantage of these opportunities and at the same time ensuring that the fuels are from sustainable sources and that increased penetrations of bio-fuel take place at least cost to the consumer.  The bio-fuel obligation scheme, as set out in this Bill, meets all of those requirements.  I appreciate the support I sense across the House for the model we are adopting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">A number of amendments are likely on Committee Stage, primarily to clarify certain matters with regard to the operation of the obligation, but also to make provision to impose a levy on electricity generators in respect of carbon allowances.  In July 2009 the Government agreed to progress legislation to recover these gains and to use the proceeds to reduce network charges for large energy users in order to support employment and economic recovery.  Amendments on Committee Stage which will place a levy upon electricity generators to recover a substantial proportion of those gains have already been published.  My Department has engaged with the Commission for Energy Regulation and the electricity industry on those measures.  I look forward to engaging further with the Opposition on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">In response to Deputy Tom Hayes's comments about a plant in Clonmel, it is the intention to use any such revenues.  They do not go back to the State; they will go back to the large energy users, the big companies that have high electricity bills to make sure that they remain competitive.  We have brought our prices back down to the European average.  We need to stay at that level and one of the ways we will do that is by means of the amendments we intend to introduce on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_1118">I agree.  One of the things we are doing among a range of different measures through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, primarily, is to put in support grants for a range of new alternative technologies, be it combined heat and power, CHP, systems fired by biomass or high efficiency energy systems.  One of the reasons we are providing that support is that we have had almost 150 years of a fossil fuel fired infrastructure.  We have built up a gas and oil infrastructure and supply chains to suit that.  We are at the start of a new alternative energy system which will take from ten to 30 years to build up.  At the start in order to build up the experience we will provide grant support.  When the system is up and running the State will step back and allow the market to take over.  That is the general approach we are seeking to adopt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">We have a real advantage in this country in that we have one of the best growing climates in the world, we have the best wind resource in the world and we have huge ocean energy potential.  Therefore, it makes economic sense for us to do it.  There is a cost initially to bring in the economies of scale and the supply chain which has not existed previously and once that is up and running one can make it market effective and efficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">The Bill is an important measure in delivering on our targets for renewable energy in transport.  Furthermore, the safety provisions of the Bill will deliver benefits to LPG consumers and to the public in general.  I look forward to working closely with the CER on ensuring the speedy implementation of the Bill's provisions, following enactment.  I will be happy to consider carefully any proposed amendments from all parties in this House.  I have accepted many amendments in the Seanad.  I prefer to listen and to accept amendments where they are appropriate as long as the Attorney General's office tells me that it is kosher.  I look forward to the early consideration of this Bill on Committee Stage where I am sure the opportunity will present itself for a more forensic review of the legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_614">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_1123">Additional representatives will include a nurse or midwife engaged in the public health sector, a nurse or midwife engaged in the education of nurses and midwives and a nurse engaged in the care of older persons.  Of these elected members at least three must be engaged in clinical practice.  Further to this a director of nursing or midwifery will be appointed and also one nurse or midwife in the third level education sector will be appointed to the board.  The Bill provides for the establishment of committees by the board and those committees may include some members who are not board members.  This will allow the individuals with the relevant expertise and experience to be on the committees.  The board will have a split term of office.  That will ensure the continuity of knowledge and experience on the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">The public needs to be assured that any person who wishes to practise as a nurse or midwife has to register with the board.  The Nurses Act 1985 provided for the statutory registration of nurses and midwives.  Part 6 of this new legislation is designed to develop registration further in the interest of the protection of the public.  Provision is included to prohibit a person practising as a nurse or midwife if the person is not registered with the board.  However, the Bill provides for the board to issue permits to nurses from another country who are in Ireland for a short period for humanitarian purposes.  The Bill protects a number of titles and makes it an offence to falsely represent oneself to be a nurse or midwife.  In future the Minister for Health and Children will be able to make regulations to designate and protect additional titles if it is appropriate and in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">Section 40 prohibits a person from attending a woman in childbirth for payment, unless the person is a midwife with adequate indemnity insurance or a doctor, or training to be a midwife or doctor, except in emergency situations.  The board will establish and maintain three registers.  The first of these, the register of nurses and midwives, will contain the names, qualifications and any other details that the board deems to be necessary of all nurses and midwives.  The legislation provides for a number of divisions.  There will be separate divisions for nurses and midwives to reflect the fact that these are now recognised as two distinct professions, as well as two distinct divisions for those nurses and midwives who are practising as advanced nurse practitioners or advanced midwife practitioners.  At this point I should like to address an issue that was raised in the public consultation undertaken by my Department.  Currently An Bord Altranais, by rules under the 1985 Act, creates a number of divisions of the current register of nurses, for example, psychiatric nurses division.  It is not, nor has it ever been, my intention that this will cease under the new legislation.  The new board will retain the power to create and maintain other divisions of the registers.  This will ensure flexibility in the new registration process.  The legislation also provides for annotation of a registration to allow for additional qualifications to be noted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">The Bill provides that the board must also establish and maintain two additional registers.  The first of these is the candidate register, which will contain the names and details of all individuals who are pursuing education and training leading to first time registration.  It will consist of at least two divisions — the nurse candidate division and the midwife candidate division.  This will provide for registration of individuals who are undertaking education and training for first time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">The second new register is the AMP-ANP post register.  This will contain the names and details of advanced nurse practitioner posts and advanced midwife practitioner posts which meet the criteria specified by the board.  It will consist of at least two divisions; the advanced nurse practitioner posts and the advanced midwife practitioner posts.  These advance practice posts will be service driven.  Where the HSE or a service provider identifies the need for such a post and puts the necessary structures and procedures in place, an application can be made to the board to have the post registered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">I wish to draw attention to the role of the advanced nurse practitioner and the advanced midwife practitioner.  These roles were developed in response to the report on the commission on nursing that recommended the adoption of an advanced practitioner model of nursing and midwifery care which would be highly skilled and tailored to meet service needs.  As these nurses and midwives are working at that advanced level, it is vital to ensure that advanced nurse and midwife practitioners only practise where the necessary structures and governance procedures are in place.  In addition the competencies and skills necessary to work at advanced practice differ, depending on the specific requirements of the advanced practitioner posts.  To guarantee these required structures and governance, skills and competencies, registration as an advanced nurse practitioner or an advanced midwife practitioner is dependent on employment or having an offer of employment in an registered advanced practice post.  This will ensure that the public is protected by guaranteeing that advanced nurse practitioners and advanced midwife practitioners are only those who meet the standards and criteria for advanced practice, and who have the skills and competencies necessary for these posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">The creation of a modern regulatory framework for nurses and midwives demands the establishment of a comprehensive fitness to practise structure which can act quickly and appropriately and is responsive to each individual complaint.  Deputies will note that the fitness to practise provisions in Parts 7 to 9, inclusive, are aligned to the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act.  Given the onerous nature of the current fitness to practise structure on all individuals involved, the Bill provides for the establishment of a preliminary proceedings committee to assess complaints prior to the board deciding on the necessity of holding a full fitness to practise inquiry.  It provides for the appointment of investigators, if required, to facilitate investigations on behalf of the preliminary proceedings committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">A mediation process or other informal means process for less serious complaints by agreement of the parties concerned is provided for.  In addition, if appropriate, the complaint can be referred to a professional competence scheme.  The Bill includes provision that a complainant, if appropriate, may to be referred to another body or to the HSE complaints procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">I have already discussed the fact that the majority of board members will not be nurses or midwives.  This will also be the case in the composition of the preliminary proceedings committee and the fitness to practise committee.  The board will have the power to appoint non-board members onto these committees to ensure that there is adequate relevant knowledge for each case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">I have widened the grounds for complaint.  There are now nine grounds for complaint and these include professional misconduct, poor professional performance and inappropriate behaviour.  This will allow the board to investigate a greater range of complaints.  Both the preliminary proceedings committee and the fitness to practise committee will possess the power to change the grounds for a complaint if, following an investigation of the facts, it is deemed that the complaint was made on incorrect grounds.  This will ensure that complaints will not simply be dismissed due to inappropriate or technical grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133">In this Bill I propose to open up the fitness to practise procedures to the public.  I have decided that, in line with the Medical Practitioners Act, fitness to practise inquiries for nurses and midwives will be undertaken in public.  In order to allow for individual situations where this may not be appropriate, provision is included for the fitness to practise committee to hold part or all of an inquiry in private, depending on the circumstances.  Any such decision must only be taken as a result of a request by a witness, including the complainant, or the nurse or midwife concerned, to hold the proceedings in private.  A decision to hold proceedings in private must take into account the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">The Bill provides for a nurse or midwife, following a request by the fitness to practise committee to consent to remedial action or to a censure by the board.  In these situations the inquiry is considered to be completed and the board will impose the measures agreed by the nurse or midwife.  It is hoped that in these circumstances the fitness to practise inquiry will be considerably shortened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">Today, Irish nurses and midwives undertake a degree-based system of education in third level institutions.  The new degree programme was a vital step in the professional development of nursing and midwifery.  Considerable investment in the education of nurses and midwives has taken place over the last ten years.  The quality and relevance of these education and training programmes is essential to ensure highly qualified nurses and midwives.  The Bill provides for the ongoing development of standards for nurse and midwifery education and the approval of such programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">Part 10 of the Bill details the responsibilities of the board and the Health Service Executive with regard to the education and training both of individuals undertaking education and training to become nurses and midwives and post-registration training and education.  The Health Service Executive will be given specific responsibilities with regard to specialist education and training, including the promotion of the development of specialist nursing and midwifery training and undertaking appropriate workforce planning for the purpose of meeting specialist staffing and training needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">We as legislators must learn from mistakes of the past and move to create stronger and more robust systems of accountability.  This can be achieved by continuing professional development and the demonstration of skills and competencies required for practice.  Ongoing professional development is of particular importance, especially where members of the public entrust their well-being to others.  We cannot legislate against mistakes but we can use this new legislation before the House to put obligations on the nurse and midwife, the employer and the regulator that will develop and mould a system for the maintenance of competency that places the safety of the patient at its centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">Part 11 of the Bill places duties on nurses, midwives, the board and employers in terms of professional competence.  Registered nurses and midwives will be obliged to maintain their professional competence on an ongoing basis.  The board, as regulator, will have a leadership role in ensuring that nurses and midwives comply with the new statutory requirements for them to maintain their professional competence on an ongoing basis.  It will develop, establish and operate one or more schemes of competence assurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">The Health Service Executive and other employers must facilitate the maintenance of competence.  The Bill specifically identifies workplace learning opportunities as being one way to facilitate the maintenance of professional competence.  Competence can be maintained in many different ways, not just by attending training courses.  As Deputies are aware, in his Budget Statement 2009, the Minister for Finance set out a programme for the rationalisation of State agencies.  A number of the agencies included in this programme fall under my aegis as Minister for Health and Children including the national council.  In line with this decision for the rationalisation of State agencies, the dissolution of the national council is included in this legislation.  The staff, assets and liabilities of the council will be transferred to the board.  Deputies have been provided with an explanatory memorandum which sets out in detail the contents of this Bill.  However, I will briefly outline the provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">Part 1 includes standard provisions relating to commencement, interpretation of terms and repeals.  Part 2 relates to An Bord Altranais.  Section 6 provides for the continuance in being of the board, but under its new name.  Section 8 sets out the object of the board as the protection of the public in its dealings with nurses and midwives and the integrity of the practice of nursing and midwifery through the promotion of high standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">Section 9 outlines the functions of the board and specifies that it will perform its functions in the public interest.  Sections 10 and 11 provide that the Minister may confer additional functions on the board by order and that an order made must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and provides for the Minister to give general policy directions to the board relating to its functions, excluding matters relating to professional conduct and ethics, complaints, inquiries and sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">Section 13 outlines the board's power to make rules and details a range of matters on which it may make such rules.  Sections 15 to 17 provide for the board to enter into co-operation agreements with prescribed bodies to avoid duplication of activities and to allow for conducting joint studies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">Part 3 provides for the board to prepare a statement of strategy on an annual basis.  Part 4 includes provisions for the membership, committees and employees of the board.</p>

          <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_615">
            <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_1144">I welcome this Bill presented by Fine Gael, which seeks to amend the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  I also thank Deputy Seán Sherlock for sharing his time and allowing me to speak on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">The Bill aims to introduce a system of administrative penalties for non-serious breaches of the original Act.  This change would be a welcome development for Irish sea fisheries.  In 2006, at the time of the introduction of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act, protests were organised by fishermen across the country.  They pointed out that the criminal system for fisheries offences that was implemented by the introduction of the 2006 Act was out of kilter with EU policy.  The then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government maintained it had no choice but to introduce criminal rather than administrative penalties on the advice of the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">At present, Ireland is the only maritime jurisdiction in the EU without a system of administrative sanctions for some fishery offences.  Instead, even minor breaches of regulations are dealt with by the courts.  This is neither an efficient nor a fair way of encouraging compliance.  In 2006, the Labour Party highlighted the unfairness of a system that could only resort to the courts.  We argued that administrative fines already existed within the Irish legal system.  During last night's debate, many examples of this were highlighted, including the Road Traffic Act.  In addition, in my own constituency of Wicklow, sanctions can be imposed under legislation for the misuse of quad bikes in the mountains.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">As far back as October 2004, the then Labour Party leader, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, wrote to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, asking him to outline the Government's position on this matter.  In his reply in December 2004, the Taoiseach stated: "There is already in our legislative code provision for the imposition of sanctions which arise in administrative proceedings".  He went on to cite examples of penalties imposed "by, for instance, the Stock Exchange, the Law Society and the Medical Council".  He concluded by stating that "with limited exceptions, our legislative code provides for confirmation, by the High Court, of such sanctions".</p>
            <p eId="para_1148">The Labour Party is of the firm view that administrative penalties are constitutional.  The response from the Taoiseach as far back as 2004 indicates the same belief.  This amending Bill has noted that fixed penalty notices are widely used throughout the Statute Book, and their use is particularly appropriate in the context of fisheries.  The Bill proposes to introduce an administrative sanction based on monetary fines, with a robust right of appeal to the District Court; this type of system has consistently been held to be within the remit of Article 37.1 of the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">It is hard to understand how a fixed penalty notice can apply on land but not at sea.  There are certainly examples, in my experience, in which administrative sanctions have developed as part of an alternative approach — for example, by the Environmental Protection Agency, or by local authorities under the Planning Acts.  It is not as if a new and unusual system is being proposed here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">The second obstacle the Government quoted on this issue was that it was a legal impossibility at EU level to introduce a system of administrative sanctions.  This is challenged by the views expressed by the European Commission and the European Parliament which, in November 2009, expressly called for administrative sanctions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">It is clear from the strong protests in 2006 and recent representations from the fishing industry that fishermen want administrative sanctions.  Much more significantly, such administrative sanctions would be welcomed by the fishery protection services.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, which is charged with enforcing this law, is in favour of administrative sanctions.  I quote Mr. Peter Whelan of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority when he spoke at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food last July:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1152">The issue of administrative sanctions was also raised in 2008.  As a regulatory authority, the SFPA is tasked with implementation of the legislation on the Statute Book.  We recognise the industry position on administrative sanctions and welcome the Commission's draft proposals to reform the main control regulation that includes a scheme of administrative sanctions in the form of penalty points.  The SFPA is actively involved in deliberations on this matter in Europe and we have also provided a comprehensive dossier of information to the Department on administrative sanctions, including details of those systems implemented in other EU countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153">This shows exactly how developed the argument is.  He went on to state:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1154">We have an enforcement strategy because we are empowered to enforce the legislation.  If we had more powers, such as giving warning letters and administrative sanctions, we would start as we do in the area of food safety, by issuing advice, guidance, warning letters, administrative sanctions and prosecutions through the court.  The compliance strategy would look at graded steps towards prosecution and the barriers to compliance on the other side of the equation and try to deal with them.  That is where we are in terms of enforcement with our compliance strategy.  At present we do not have the gift to issue administrative sanctions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">It seems there could be a sophisticated approach in developing a compliance strategy that includes administrative sanctions as a matter of course, if there was the political will to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">Ireland stands alone in the EU on this issue and remains the only EU member that does not have such a scheme.  In recent years, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and England and Wales have all introduced administrative sanctions.  One can see the argument that it delivers efficiency and reduces costs.  It removes uncertainty and ensures there is a further weapon in the armoury of the sea fishery protection services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">While I welcome this Bill and its aim to introduce a mechanism that allows a non-court option for certain breaches, I must consider the question of enforcement.  Just as there is an issue with enforcement of traffic-related fines across the Border, there may be an issue with ensuring compliance by foreign vessels.  This point was raised yesterday evening by Deputy Sheahan, and it should be considered again on Committee Stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">The proposal that has been outlined by Fine Gael seems to be a modernising approach which regrettably does not find favour with the Government.  This is a pity because it seems there are ways of fleshing out the Bill on Committee Stage if the Government is willing to accept it in principle.  Perhaps it is a lack of confidence, or perhaps it just does not want the bother, but there is definitely a resistance towards accepting Private Members' motions and Bills.  I can think of a number of Bills that have been produced by the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security which are gathering dust.  It is not that there are flaws in the legislation; the problem is within the Government itself.  There is not the confidence or assurance to take the best of what is offered by the Opposition, often after a considerable amount of time.  In this instance, the Bill has been on the Order Paper since last year, so it is not as if there has not been time to give it full scrutiny.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">I welcome the publication of this Bill and I urge cross-party support for its provisions.  The decision, obviously, will be taken by way of a vote through which the Government can determine the future of this Bill.  However, it seems to me shortsighted that we cannot fully debate and go through all Stages of such a progressive piece of legislation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne</from>
            <p eId="para_1162">It gives me great pleasure as a Fianna Fáil backbencher from the class of 2007 to speak, at the request of the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Seán Connick, on the occasion of the first Private Members' business being taken by him.  We on the Fianna Fáil backbenches are all conscious of the great honour of his appointment and are proud of him.  Long before he was appointed as Minister of State to the Department, Deputy Connick demonstrated immense regard, respect and dedication to the fishing industry.  It is no surprise, therefore, that he is the latest in a long line of Wexford fisheries Ministers.  His new job is important to the economy.  The fact he represents us at European level, where many of the important decisions are taken, leads me to suggest he should have full Cabinet status.  That would be a big bonus for the south east.  However, that is a matter not for me but for a higher authority.  I wish him well.  He has shown great commitment to this industry, as evidenced by his speech last night.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">The fishing industry is of great importance to the country, but not so important in my constituency of Meath East, which has only approximately 200 ft of coastline in the Gormanston area, probably the shortest coastline of any constituency.  I welcome the fact the Bill put forward by Fine Gael is well intentioned.  On-the-spot fines and administrative sanctions might suit our fishermen if caught doing something they should not be doing.  It is important that we remember that is the issue behind this Bill.  Our objective is to save the fishing stock, but the Bill and its terms, as set out by Fine Gael, would apply to all fishermen, not just our own, in the waters where it would be applied.  In some way, that would be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p>
            <p eId="para_1164">The objectives the Minister of State has set out in response to this Bill, in terms of protecting our fish stock, are of important national interest.  His proposals go beyond the interests of the fishermen.  The fishermen are an important part of the economy, but it is the overall national interest that must take precedence, irrespective of the interests of important interest groups like the fishermen.  In the overall national interest, the Minister of State has adopted a tough and consistent policy towards illegalities in the practice of fishing in order to save stocks of what is a healthy product for the rest of the country.  I wish the Minister of State well and believe he is right to oppose this Bill.  However, perhaps work could be done to resolve the issue further down the line.  Deputy Kenneally probably has some ideas in that regard because his constituency has a more important fishing industry than mine.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_619">
            <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
            <p eId="para_1165">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Although I come from a coastal county where fishing is not at a level associated with the constituency of the Minister of State or other constituencies around the coastline, it is still an important feature of economic life there.  I wish to be associated with the positive remarks Deputy Byrne made on the appointment of Deputy Connick as a Minister of State.  In his time on the backbenches he has shown a determination and willingness to take on difficult issues.  Irrespective of the Department to which he is attached, he brings a level of freshness to our entire debate.  His attitude and approach generally is to challenge issues and widely held views.  I know he would not reject this Bill just for the sake of rejecting it or because his officials advised him to, but that he would have taken time to study it and its implications for the fishing industry.  I am confident, based on the submission he made here yesterday, that his response is well thought out and based on his knowledge and understanding of the facts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1166">There is little doubt that the conservation of fish stocks is vital.  We all recognise that despite the old adage that something is as plentiful as the fish in the sea, is no longer the case.  We have seen a considerable decline in our fish stocks.  In order to have an effective conservation policy, we must have an effective method of policing it.  Penalties are very much part of that.  The Opposition recognises that our fish stocks are at historically low levels.  We need to strengthen rather than weaken the resolve to protect our stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">The Minister of State has outlined clearly that the Bill could introduce low fines for significant offences, which would promote illegal activity.  I believe it is the intention of the proposers of the Bill to try to assist smaller fishermen, who would be the focus of all our intentions.  However, they should be aware that anything that might be done to assist smaller fishermen might, ultimately, leave the back door open for larger fishermen who might, through a weakening of the situation benefit to a point that would make it easier for them to continue or develop an illegal practice.  This concern is at the heart of our opposition to the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">Deputy Byrne pointed out that it is not just about protecting fishing stocks.  We protect them for a reason.  There  is a strong, viable economic dividend to our fishing industry and in the region of 11,000 jobs are associated with it.  These are jobs in rural communities, areas where it is difficult to encourage foreign direct investment and where we do not find the multinationals or have a presence of the IDA type supported companies.  The fishing industry is vital for these areas.  I understand the industry contributes in the region of €780 million to our national economy in 2008.  This clearly underpins the necessity to protect our fishing stocks.  I have every confidence the Minister of State is attempting to protect the fishing culture in our rural communities and the importance it brings from the economic perspective.  At the same time, it is important there are effective controls but that these are not overly burdensome, particularly on smaller fishermen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">We all recognise that while we have vast fishing grounds around our coast, there are bigger players from other nations, particularly Spain.  We would not want to undermine the sanctions that prevent the predatory practices of fishermen from those nations while making an effort to assist those we want to help.  I would not want to see a situation where we set out to assist a vulnerable group, but ultimately open up a facility for the larger predators to break the law, damage fish stocks and face only weak sanctions.  That would not be in the interest of either the economic component of the industry or its future development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">I compliment the Minister of State on his approach and wish him well in his ongoing discussions and negotiations at European level.  Those negotiations and general fishing policy are very much part of a combined effort through the European Union.  He has a very difficult job to do but, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be aware, he has the skills, tenacity and the mettle to deliver for fishermen in Ireland.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</from>
            <p eId="para_1171">This is the first opportunity I have had publicly to congratulate Deputy Connick on his promotion to the office of Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries.  I am aware from dealings I have had with the Minister of State previously that he has a great interest in this area.  Our constituencies are divided from each other by the Waterford estuary but there is a ferry link between them.  We share many common interests in the fisheries area and the Minister has great knowledge of what is required.  I wish him well with his portfolio.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">I have some sympathy with the proposals in the Private Members' Bill brought forward by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.  During the passage of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 through the Oireachtas, I was my party's spokesperson in the Seanad on marine and fisheries matters.  It would be hypocritical of me to take a totally different line from the one I took on that occasion, and I will not do that.  Therefore, I see merit in what is being proposed.  I believe in administrative sanctions and that they should be introduced.  They could be introduced.  However, I will discuss that later.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</from>
            <p eId="para_1174">The problem is that this Bill is not sufficiently specific.  One of the problems I envisage is similar to what Deputy Dooley just mentioned.  My concern has always been for the smaller fishermen.  I do not mean smaller in stature, but in fishing capability.  The bigger operators out at sea are the people who have always done the damage.  I am afraid the Bill as drafted will not be enough of a deterrent to the fishermen who are causing problems for fishery stocks, and all of us have an idea who they are.  They should not get off the hook in any way and I believe that might happen with this legislation, well-intentioned as it is.  It is the other fishermen whose concerns must be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">I did not have a great deal of time to prepare for this debate but I saw some figures in an EU report from a number of years ago about average fines.  The average fine for fishing without a licence in Spain was €1,463, while in Ireland it was €21,400.  The joint committee dealing with communications, the marine and natural resources of the last Dáil held much debate on this issue.  One of the contributors to that debate stated that the average fine for a log book offence in Denmark was €393 while in Ireland it was €8,455.  The average fine in the UK for fishing for species subject to prohibition was €2,328, while in Ireland it was €23,125.  It is important to point out that while the Spanish and UK vessels are fishing side by side in the same waters with our fishing vessels, different penalties are being imposed for identical offences.  Unfortunately, the law is not equal across all EU fishing nations and I believe that, as a consequence of the legislation we passed previously, the imbalance might now be greater.  Ireland is the only maritime country in the EU to rely solely on criminal sanctions.  I believe the UK was the last of the other countries to introduce administrative sanctions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1177">I am a supporter of administrative sanctions but previously we were told this could not be done.  I read the Minister of State's speech last night with interest.  His tone was different from what previous fisheries Ministers said in the past.  He said: "The Irish legal system, in principle, permits the operation of a fixed penalty notice system in respect of minor penalties which afford the person an opportunity of paying the fixed penalty and avoiding criminal prosecution.  Under such a system, fines are only imposed where they are accepted, and if a person wishes to dispute the alleged offence, then the matter is tried by a court."  I agree with him.  I do not know if the change in tone from what fisheries Ministers said in the past is due to something I stumbled upon some time ago, a by-law of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.  It was Statutory Instrument No. 293, but I am not sure of what year.  Basically, that by-law permitted administrative sanctions, so there are administrative sanctions in the fisheries sector.  That by-law was approved by the Attorney General.  For that reason, I could never understand why we could not introduce administrative sanctions.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</from>
            <p eId="para_1182">I looked at the Bill and the wording is not tight enough.  That is the problem.  The Deputy will not succeed in what he is trying to achieve in the Bill.  For that reason I will not be able to support it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">Part of the reason there are problems is that most of the fishermen who are targeted for illegal fishing are the smaller operators who fish closer to shore.  We go after the easy target.  One could probably say that about enforcement in other walks of life as well, but it is a fact.  I recall Commodore Lynch appearing before the committee I mentioned earlier on 12 October 2005.  I related an incident to him that had occurred shortly before that in Portally Cove near Dunmore East in my constituency.  A person was hauling lobster pots, quite legally.  The Southern Regional Fisheries Board vessel came alongside to check him out.  That was quite correct; the vessel was only doing its job.  However, there was a naval vessel there as well.  When I put the matter to Commodore Lynch, he replied that if the Naval Service is called on to assist, it will come inshore to help.  It is surely overkill to have a Naval Service vessel coming to support fisheries officers in a case where there is only one person hauling lobster pots.  It would be far better employed out at sea catching the real culprits who are doing the real damage and causing problems for our fishing industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">Some of these large vessels are huge.  One of those boats probably does as much damage as 100 smaller vessels, yet it is the smaller vessels that are relentlessly pursued.  If I had sufficient time, I had intended to relate a couple of instances where fishermen were prosecuted for minor offences.  They went into court with clean records but ended up with criminal records.  For that reason, we must change this.</p>

            <p eId="para_1188">The Bill proposes a new system of administrative sanctions for fisheries offences.  According to Fine Gael, this Bill will establish a much improved enforcement mechanism for less serious fisheries infractions, promote a greater culture of compliance and reduce administrative and other costs for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and fishermen alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">The Irish sea fisheries sector is almost totally dependent on healthy fish stocks in Ireland's 200 mile exclusive fisheries zone.  As the House will be aware, fish stocks in our zone are at historically low levels.  It is essential we take whatever measures are necessary to reverse this decline in fish stocks.  Unfortunately, this Bill would have the opposite effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">The Minister of State for fisheries, Deputy Connick, made clear in the Dáil yesterday that he did not believe this Bill would increase fish stocks.  He explained it could result in increasing the level of illegal fishing and further drive down fish stocks, leading to a collapse of many of the key commercial stocks around the coast on which our fishing industry relies heavily.  He made clear that this Bill could have two possible outcomes, neither of which would protect fish stocks.  The first possibility would be that this new Bill could introduce low fines which would do little to deter illegal activity.  It could also result in undue attention being paid to minor offences as opposed to channelling the little resources we have into dealing with the major offenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">There are a number of flaws with the Bill.  It would remove the current protections in place in Irish legislation against illegal fishing and could potentially result in illegal landings in Ireland's 200 mile zone.</p>

            <p eId="para_1193">Over recent years we have seen a significant decline in quotas and this is a matter of urgency.  The Minister of State made clear that he is committed to supporting changes in the Common Fisheries Policy that strengthen that policy and deliver better management and conservation methods for our fisheries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">The Minister of State, Deputy Connick, recently set out Ireland's priorities for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy at a meeting of fisheries ministers in Spain.  The meeting discussed the differing views and proposals put forward by member states.  Some of Ireland's priorities for the new Common Fisheries Policy are a new focus on addressing the discarding of fish at sea, the retention of a management system based on national quotas supported by increased flexibility, a complex rejection of the mandatory privatisation of fish quotas or the international trading of fish quotes, and new measures to develop an environmental and economically sustainable aquaculture sector which could reduce our dependence on imported products.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">To stem the decline in fish stocks, it is essential we bring in improved conservation measures and tackle illegal fishing by fleets in our waters.  This will be done through reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The decline in fish stocks is clearly a European issue and actions to address this and ensure sustainable fishing practices must be taken at the European Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">I do not believe this Bill will address illegal fishing in our waters and lead to increased stock levels.  There is a risk it will damage our stock levels further and bring in a new culture of non-compliance.  In fact, this Bill could have a regressive effect on the fishing industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">Since 1959, Ireland has applied criminal law in fisheries matters and, since our membership of the European Community, Ireland has applied the criminal law in the enforcement of fisheries policies.  In the case of most fisheries offences, the EU Common Fisheries Policy requires that the penalties must be effective, a deterrent and dissuasive, and must involve depriving the wrongdoer of the benefit of his or her actions.  This is necessary to protect fish stocks from illegal fishing.  The legal advice, I believe, is that imposing sanctions such as these set out in the Bill would undermine the existing legislative framework.  The new EU fisheries control regulation introduces a new and common approach to fisheries regulation with the introduction for the first time of a penalty points system.  That system is completely different from what is proposed in the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">The Bill would have a negative impact on the industry in terms of future reducing stock levels through increased illegal activity in our waters and this would certainly be bad news for the 11,000 employed in the industry.</p>

            <from>Deputy Darragh O’Brien</from>
            <p eId="para_1202">The Bill proposes a new system of administrative sanctions for fisheries offences.  The Fine Gael Bill claims to establish a much improved enforcement mechanism for less serious fisheries infractions, promote a greater culture of compliance and reduce administrative and other costs for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and fishermen alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">Over recent years we have seen a significant decline in quotas.  Scientific evidence shows that many fish stocks important to Irish fishermen have declined to dangerously low levels.  It is the health of these stocks which ultimately determines the economic viability of this industry and it must be our priority when considering any new legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">The issue of how and at what level sanctions should be applied has been an issue with the fishing industry since fish stocks declined and quotas began to be reduced and more strictly implemented.  It is also an issue which has been considered by the Government on many occasions.  Under EU law, Ireland is required to have an enforcement system which is effective and dissuasively proportionate, and any failure in this regard could result in a large financial penalties being imposed on the State and the Irish taxpayer, as happened to France in 2005 when it was fined €20 million by the EU.  It is of national importance that an appropriate regime is in place to protect fish stocks from any illegal fishing in Ireland's 200 mile exclusive fisheries zone.  The Government is committed to supporting changes to the Common Fisheries Policy that strengthen that policy and deliver better management and conservation methods for our fisheries which would have a positive impact on fish stock levels in the medium to long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">I do not believe this Bill will protect against illegal fishing and may, in fact, have a number of negative effects.  There are two potential effects of this Bill.  It could introduce low fines for significant offences resulting in increased illegal landings.</p>

            <p eId="para_1207">The other possibility is that it would divert too much attention to a new tier of minor offences and distract from the work being done to prosecute the major offenders.  The Bill does not provide the necessary measures to regulate the fishing industry and would not give a reasonable level of confidence that illegal fishing would not be rewarded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">The advice of successive Attorneys General has been that the imposition of such sanctions would undermine the existing legislative framework.  Since 1959, successive Irish Governments have applied criminal law in fisheries matters and, since our membership of the European Community, Ireland has applied criminal law in the enforcement of fisheries policy.  Ireland does this to protect the fish stocks in our zone on which our 2,000-strong vessel fishing fleet is dependent.  The Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 sets down the maximum financial fines that may be applied and it is a matter for a judge to determine the appropriate fine, if any, taking into account specifics in the case.  The proposed fixed penalty notice would most likely lead to a significant increase in illegal fishing by fleets in our waters and put increased pressure on our stocks.  Alongside this, it would jeopardise an important industry that generates 11,000 jobs and contributed  almost €800 million to the economy in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">I do not support this Bill.  I believe the proposals put forward will not act as a sufficient deterrent to illegal landings and, instead, our limited resources will be diverted into dealing with new minor offences.  The potential impact, if it were introduced, would be negative for the conservation of fish stocks or for the coastal communities depending on fishing.  It would also put at risk Ireland's obligation under EU law to ensure an effective and dissuasive enforcement system is in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_1213">It will be very difficult to articulate a counter-argument after the impressive contribution from the maritime county of Longford by Deputy Peter Kelly.  It is a sign of the quality of this debate that people are being rolled out to defend the indefensible.  I was remiss not to mention Dublin North also.  I congratulate Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Creed for working on this issue over a long time and their work is the result of much time and research.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">The Minister will be aware of the work involved in fishing.  A fisherman must know how to navigate, he endures intermittent sleep patterns while searching for fish and he must also manage a business.  If his catch is four or five kilos overweight, he could end up with a criminal prosecution.  That is the weight of pressure on these men.  A psychological issue arises whereby the fishing community feels discriminated against.  Its members do not believe there is a level playing pitch.  They look at our neighbours in the European Union, across the water in the United Kingdom and at the administrative sanctions in force in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">We must consider our role within the North-South Ministerial Council.  Northern Ireland has an administrative and judicial system under devolved government and led by Mr. Ford of the Alliance Party.  I suggest we should consider an integrated marine policy under the mechanism of the Good Friday Agreement.  Integrated marine policy is one of the aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.</p>

Members of the House and the Government should consider the type of sanctions we have introduced.  Our fishermen who gather fish in their nets inadvertently would prefer to take that fish home and give them away for free.  It is a national disgrace.  It is also a disgrace for Deputies from County Longford and those who come into this House with no knowledge of the maritime coastal communities and no knowledge of what is happening on a daily basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">The Government should put its hands up and accept there is an issue being highlighted on this side of the House.  We must bring the maritime community on-side.  We must look at all aspects of the industry and try to bring the fishermen back.  We have lost our fishing community through sanctions that are not workable.  The common-sense argument being articulated on this side of the House is that administrative sanctions are preferable to giving fishermen a criminal record.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_1220">I compliment Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Creed for drafting this Bill.  As Deputy McHugh said, a lot of time has gone into drafting this Bill.  Coming from Cork South-West, both Deputy O'Keeffe and his colleague, Deputy Sheehan, are very aware of the concerns of fishermen.  The purpose of the Bill is to introduce fixed penalty notices or on-the-spot fines for minor fishing offences.  Some Government Deputies were attempting to interpret this Bill in a different way because they do not wish to vote for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">Ireland is one of the few countries that does not have a combined system of on-the-spot fines and criminal sanctions.  As Deputy McHugh said, fishermen feel that they are forgotten.  Generations of people living along the coastal areas have relied on fishing for their livelihoods.  However, competition, restrictions and quotas have forced many fishermen to moor their boats permanently.  Those who remain in the industry feel they are being hounded by restriction and regulation.  This is a very good Bill which will harmonise our law with the European Union in the way infringements are sanctioned.  The Bill provides for the introduction of a points system similar to that which applies in many other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1222">I am from County Clare and I wish to talk about the fishing industry in my county.  While fishing is not the most important industry in the region, it is important to the many fishermen who live in the coastal villages from the cliffs of Moher, Liscannor and all the way down to Quilty, Carrigaholt, Dunbeg and various other small villages.  The main types of fishing in County Clare are for crab and lobster and these account for the biggest landings.  A total of 90% of the crab and lobster catches are exported to France and Spain.  Our local fishermen in County Clare have undertaken significant work in lobster management and conservation with courses funded by BIM and the Government.  The problem with lobster and crab fishing is that prices have fallen substantially.  A few months ago, lobster and crab fetched €18 per kilo while today the price is down to €10 per kilo.  Most fishermen will say they cannot make a living out of those prices.  Cheap lobster and crab is being imported into Europe from the United States and Canada to be processed here as if it were an EU product.  Fishermen's incomes must be put back on line again.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill introduces a new system which will modernise and monitor all vessels, in that satellite-based electronic log book systems on board vessels over 12 m will report at regular intervals to centralised bases in each member state.  Landings for the first sale of fish must be reported into the system and each member state will have to cross-check to ensure the accuracy of the information.  Recreational fishing will be introduced into the monitoring system for the first time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">I am disappointed that the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, has left the Chamber.  He got a lot of praise from his Fianna Fáil colleagues.  If Deputy Connick wants to make a good name for himself as a fisheries Minister, he should support this Bill.  It is essential to have a level playing pitch across Europe so that the same system of control applies to Irish and foreign vessels operating in our waters.</p>

            <p eId="para_1225">This Bill has brought to my mind the fishing industry in Waterford or what is left of it.  I could not find any definitive figures for the number of people in County Waterford or nationally who are making a living from the sea.  I did some research and found some reports done over the past ten years which give an idea of what has happened to the industry generally.  In 1999 the report, the National Investment Priorities for the Irish Seafood Industry 2000-2006, prepared by the national strategy review group on the Common Fisheries Policy, stated the industry, comprising fishing, aquaculture, processing and ancillary sectors, employed 15,832 people directly between full-time and part-time jobs.  In 2003, a report from EUROSTAT and the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries put employment at 10,584 for the entire sector including fishing, aquaculture, processing and ancillary sectors, a reduction of 5,000 jobs since the 1999 report.  In 2006, a Marine Institute report, Sea Change, estimated direct and indirect employment in the industry stood at 5,960.</p>
            <p eId="para_1226">According to three government-sponsored reports, 10,000 direct and indirect jobs have been lost in seven years in the fishing industry.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, figures suggest the numbers working on fishing vessels is actually down to 2,100 people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">The industry has been obliterated since Fianna Fáil came to power 13 years ago.  I suggest for next year's census, the occupational grouping, "Farming, fishing and forestry" is separated so a clear picture of how many fishermen are left can be garnered.  I have no great expectation there will be much of an improvement on the figures I have just given.</p>
            <p eId="para_1228">One reason it has become unattractive to remain in fishing is that fishermen face excessive criminal sanctions and prosecutions for minor offences and breaches of fishing quotas.  In County Waterford, there was the historical issue of how fishermen were treated in the recent past by those who were meant to be responsible for enforcing the law.  It is only 11 years ago that three officials from the southern fisheries board were dismissed from their posts after several inquiries.  For 20 years, there had been allegations of corrupt activities on the part of several senior fisheries officers in the board.  Salmon fishermen fishing from Wexford through Waterford to Ballycotton were subject to a campaign of intimidation and, on occasions, violence by these officials.  Several fishermen were wrongly sent to prison, many were assaulted and dozens lost their licences and were never able to make a living again from fishing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Connick, must consider what has happened to the fishing industry under Fianna Fáil's watch.  The Government needs to incentivise people to return to making a living from the sea instead of making it harder by prosecuting them for minor fisheries offences.  Most of the fishermen in my county are already gone.  The least the Government can do is introduce a reasonable regime of administrative sanctions that will make it bearable for those remaining fishermen.</p>

            <from>Deputy Dinny McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_1230">I welcome the introduction of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction (Fixed Penalty Notice) (Amendment) Bill 2009.  It was necessitated because of some of the draconian measures incorporated in the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 such as boats tied up or gear and catches confiscated for minor infringements.  When first introduced, the legislation contained a provision giving the Naval Service the power to fire upon our fishing fleet.  Thankfully, this measure was dropped along with some others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">However, the one measure that fishermen believe adds insult to injury is that a minor infringement of fishing regulations can be looked upon as a criminal act.  This has wider implications for those in the industry who may be seeking other employment positions, for example, in the Garda or the Army, because having a criminal record means one is disbarred from applying.  Having a record also disbars one from being allowed go to the United States of America seeking work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">In 2006, Fine Gael opposed these measures with our then spokesperson, Deputy John Perry, promising the Bill's reform in the party's 2007 general election manifesto.  I congratulate Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on introducing this reasonable, responsible and well thought out Bill.  One would expect such from someone with a legal professional background and knowledge of the fishing industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">Bunbeg, County Donegal, where I grew up, was once a fishing village with up to as many as 40 half-deckers operating out of its port and maintaining the livelihoods of 130 families in the parish.  In the winter months each boat was involved in the herring fisheries, bringing in 30 crans or 40 crans per boat, enough to keep four families from the emigrant ship.  In the summer, the half-deckers worked the salmon fisheries.  This kept the community going for many generations since the Famine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">Today, three punts operate out of Bunbeg port and are only allowed to fish some lobster and crab.  As Deputy Pat Breen said, it is hardly worth it for a boat to go out for lobster because its price has collapsed.  They also have to compete with imports from the United States and Canada, some of which are so undersized they would not be allowed to be fished here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">This is repeated in other coastal communities in Donegal, particularly on the islands such as Tory and Árainn Mhór.  The state of the fishing industry was the county's economic barometer.  In Killybegs, the entire fleet, worth €500 million, is tied up from February until October every year with no income.  I agree with Deputy John Deasy that the industry is a pale shadow of what it was.  The Fianna Fáil-led Governments over the past 13 years have presided over the death of the fishing industry in peripheral areas along the western seaboard.  The Government could at least amend the legislation and decriminalise some of the infringements in the 2006 Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_1236">I thank Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Michael Creed for bringing forward this important legislation.  Obviously much work has gone into putting it together.  It seeks to correct the controversial Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 whose measures are unjust and unfair and which criminalises fishermen for minor technical breaches of fishing quotas.  Rather than making fishermen criminals, the Fine Gael Bill seeks simply to fine them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">We realise how important the Irish seafood industry is to the country.  More than 11,000 people are employed in the industry, which contributes more than €0.75 billion to the economy every year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">The Minister will be aware of the many other problems faced by fishermen on a daily basis apart from the fear of being criminalised by over-fishing.  I refer to the high cost of fuel, a real issue among fishermen in my constituency, where prices have risen by at least 50% in recent years.  I refer to the decline in Irish fish prices, restrictive EU fishing quotas and depleting fishing stocks.  Fishermen have enough to contend with on a daily basis every time they leave port without reference to this serious issue.  The proposed legislation is humane.  The lives and livelihoods of ordinary people are affected and they must be preserved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">Howth Harbour, where there is a proud tradition of fishing, is in my constituency of Dublin North-East.  Fishermen are not impressed with the regulator, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, which is treating them with contempt.  There is a sour and poisonous relationship between fishermen and the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  Trust must be introduced into the equation.  This is why Deputies Creed and O'Keeffe should be commended for introducing this legislation to try to build bridges between the regulator and fishermen.  Fishermen cannot continue given the way things are going at present.  To a certain extent, the Minister has sold the fishermen down the Swanee.  However, the Minister has an opportunity tonight to correct the record, to put things right and to fine fishermen rather than make criminals out of them.  I trust the Minister will listen to and take note of what we have said on this side of the House.</p>

I call on the Government to accept it at this late stage and to make the necessary amendments on Committee Stage.  It is wrong that if small fishermen make a mistake, they and their family members could be regarded as criminals if they are caught over-fishing and charged.  As Deputy McGinley and other speakers have stated, they could have a criminal record for the remainder of their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">I wish to put on record certain matters relating to the west.  Fishing was a very lively industry at one time.  However, now it is a tourism attraction because the Fianna Fáil Government has destroyed the industry.  It has sold it down the drain to Europe over the years.  It is outrageous that there are Spanish boats coming into our areas, taking our fish out of the country and making money on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">I compliment Deputy John Perry who, on a previous occasion, introduced a good policy in respect of fishing.  He travelled to Blacksod Bay, Mayo, Donegal and throughout the country to the south east.  He met fishermen, listened to them and he realised what they sought.  His policy could have worked.</p>

            <p eId="para_1245">Fishing is a difficult, hard business and one in which there should be more people working.  This country is in recession and if we are to get it up and running again it will require the development of agriculture and fisheries to create employment and jobs.  When we receive European regulations we go ten times further in implementing them than every other country.  We have regulated our fishermen out of business and we have sold them down the drain in the way in which we have given in at European level.  This has happened because we have not had a strong Minister in Europe to defend them, to fight for them and to keep them in the business.  It is wrong that many more people could and should be in the industry or business but they are being sold down the drain.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">Many families in the west made a living from fishing.  There is much talk about the salmon industry.  Now it appears the problems are nothing to do with the amount of fish but relate to climate issues.  Apparently, that is the reason the fish are not coming into the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1249">Fianna Fáil has always maintained it is the rural party.  However, it let down the fishermen, the farmers and the country and it has let us down in Europe because it did not negotiate for us.</p>

I have raised this issue at every available opportunity since my election to the Dáil in 1981 and I have outlined the problems relating to the fishing industry during that period.  I am disappointed at the response of the new Minister in his contribution to the debate.  Up to now, I have heard the Attorney General used as an excuse for not amending the scheme in many replies to questions.  However, the Minister maintains now that this measure would not be good for fishing stocks.  This says a good deal about his concern for our fishermen.  I refer to those who risk their lives in all weathers to provide food for us 24 hours per day, not on a nine to five basis as his ministerial colleague would wish, in view of his recent efforts to restrict the rescue services.  I advise the new Minister that he should accept the Bill and I am very disappointed he is not in the House tonight to hear what we have to say.</p>

            <p eId="para_1257">I hear complaints on a daily basis about the over-vigorous enforcement of regulations by officers of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, which has more than twice as many fisheries protection officers as the combined totals of the authorities in France and Spain.  The laws in question were imposed by this Government, not by the EU.  Every other country in the European Union is capable of administering these sanctions under administrative rules rather than in criminal courts.</p>

            <p eId="para_1259">It is a pity the Minister did not apply these rules to the banks.  Had he done so, some of them would not be hiding from Charlie Bird behind a couch in Boston.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority has two arms but its right hand acts differently from its left hand in dealing with food safety and fishermen.  In an appearance before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the authority stated it would prefer to use the administrative method for both arms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The Minister should take cognisance of the remarks of the eminent lawyer and senior counsel, Dr. Gerard Hogan, in an appearance before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to discuss the constitutionality of administrative sanctions which apply under the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  His advice to the committee at the time was that Ireland is not correct in criminalising its trawler skippers because they might have an additional box or two of monkfish or cod in their catch.  How can a trawler owner be responsible for whatever is in a net after two or three hours trawling the Atlantic ocean?  In an effort towards conservation, such an owner is supposed to dump the fish back into the sea because he or she could face a criminal charge were the excess catch to be landed.  What conservation efforts are served by dumping dead fish into the sea when half the world starves?</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">The Minister is lost at sea when operating this law of criminalisation.  He is criminalising the trawler owners.  They have been criminalised for the past ten years and cannot even travel to the United States because they have a criminal indictment against their names.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">When will the Minister abide by the advice the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food received from Dr. Gerard Hogan?  When will he put in place the necessary legislation to make all fisheries offences administrative rather than criminal in nature?  The Minister ought not leave this as his legacy.  He has not much time remaining and should do the right thing now.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">I refer to all Members on the other side of the House who intend to vote against this Bill tonight.  They ought not come near the fishing ports along our coast seeking votes after voting to make our fishermen criminals.  The Government should look instead to its criminal banking friends.  The largest fish landing port in the country is now Cork Airport which handles imports from France, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and China.  The Minister must ensure common sense prevails before it is too late.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Brendan Smith)</from>
            <p eId="para_1267">I acknowledge that the issue of controlling the activity of fishing vessels is of great interest and importance to Deputies.  I also appreciate the work of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe in drafting the Bill, with the support of his colleague, Deputy Creed, and fully accept that it was done with a view to introducing a strengthened regime for the control of fishing activity.  However, for the reasons I will set out, I am not convinced the Bill would have a positive impact on the management and control of fishing activity in Ireland's 200-mile exclusive fisheries zone.  Rather, it would risk having a significant adverse impact on the state of fish stocks in our zone, on which our fishing industry is totally dependent, and could introduce a new tier of minor bureaucratic offences.  I will address some of the issues raised in the debate with a view to improving the understanding of the Government's concern about the impact of the Bill and also answer some specific questions raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">The legal position on administrative fines was set out clearly by the Minister of State, Deputy Connick.  He explained that the Government, on the basis of its legal advice, could not implement the Bill in the way intended by Fine Gael and that if it were implemented in any other way, it would have adverse effects.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has stressed that the Fine Gael Bill does not seek to introduce a system of administrative penalties but involves on-the-spot fines.  In reality, such fines are criminal, not administrative sanctions.  To make the case that the introduction of on-the-spot fines would decriminalise fishery offences is not correct.  Where these fines apply, an offender has the option of denying the charge and fighting it in court.  Under Irish law such fines are used for minor offences where a fixed penalty can be applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">In the context of fishery infringements, penalties must be proportionate and, therefore, variable.  It is not practical or suitable to provide for fixed penalties other than for the most minor offences.  Such minor offences are subject to warnings by the Naval Service or the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  My understanding of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's view is that the current warnings would remain in place and that these on-the-spot fines would apply to medium offences.  The latter usually involve actions involving illegal fishing that confers financial benefit.  The level of financial benefit for fishery offences is often significant and a value of much more than €1,000 would be easily achieved.  If a vessel owner is prepared to risk illegal fishing, he or she is surely seeking a reasonable financial benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">Article 90 of the relevant EU regulation specifies the list of serious offences which includes not fulfilling the obligation to record and report catch or catch-related data.  The provision covers a range of activities, including logbook reporting, reporting of sales and tampering with vessel monitoring systems.  These are the types of offences usually prosecuted and I do not see that there is scope to redefine such offences as minor in nature, particularly taking account of the European Union legislation.  As advised, it is clear that administrative penalties or fixed penalty notices are not appropriate for offences where a significant financial reward may accrue to the offender, potentially in excess of the penalty imposed.  Such offences must under the Constitution come before the courts.  Therefore, the only legally acceptable approach would involve applying the provisions of the Fine Gael Bill to minor offences which currently are not prosecuted or are dealt with by means of a warning.  In effect, accepting the Bill would require a new tier of offences which are currently not prosecuted to be created.  This would have the effect of increasing the bureaucratic burden on the industry and diverting limited resources from the detection of serious offences to the administration of minor infringements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">The focus of the debate has not surprisingly been on the possible impact of the Bill on the fishing industry.  However, any such scheme must apply to all vessels operating in Ireland's 200-mile exclusive fisheries zone.  These waters are some of the richest fishing grounds in the European Union and fished by vessels from a range of member states and also third countries, particularly Norway.  As has been discussed during the debate, any regime put in place for on-the-spot fines must be equally applicable to all fishing activity engaged in by all countries and must be applied and be seen to be applied by the State authorities in an even-handed manner.  The control and enforcement of fisheries rules inside Ireland's exclusive fisheries zone present a substantial challenge for the State, even more so in today's world where resources are limited.  These limited resources must be used to deliver the maximum return in terms of effectiveness.  I am concerned that the introduction of an on-the-spot fines system for minor offences which is all that could be permitted would substantially divert the resources of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  I am strongly committed to delivering strengthened and more effective controls across the European Union and, in particular, the promotion of a level playing field in control across member states.  Ireland has, following hard work by successive Ministers with responsibility for fisheries, made substantial advances in delivering a level playing field in control.  The new European Union electronic logbook will be introduced for all large fishing vessels operating in our waters in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">During the debate claims that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority was unfairly targeting Irish vessels for controls were raised by several Deputies.  Deputy Tom Sheahan set down the statistics for boardings and inspections in order to make the point.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is an independent body in respect of its operational activities.  However, in order to assist the debate I have asked it for information on certain of the issues raised.  Some Deputies made reference to an unspecified case in which a file was purported to have been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in regard to the under-declaration of fish in the amount of 4 kg.  This sounded strange and the authority has advised that it is not aware of any such case.  Moreover, it assures me that it would not take a case in respect of such a small non-compliance issue, unless there were a number of other significant infringements arising in the same case and the over-fishing was relevant in proving these other suspected infringements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">Deputy Tom Sheahan suggested last night that there were fewer inspections carried out on Irish vessels than on foreign vessels.  In 2009 there were 18,552 landings by Irish vessels, of which 11% were inspected in port by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  Of the 1,600 landings by foreign vessels, 46% were inspected in port.</p>

            <p eId="para_1276">I congratulate my Fine Gael Party colleagues, Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Creed, for bringing forward this legislation.  The Bill has been drafted to deal in a practical and sensible manner with sea fisheries offences.  A fixed penalty system is the appropriate enforcement response to minor breaches of sea fisheries law.  Fisheries offences in Ireland are prosecuted under section 28 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  The Act provides for stiff maximum penalties to be imposed for fisheries offences.  Under its terms, almost all offences require the imposition of extremely serious penalties, even for non-serious offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">Under the Common Fisheries Policy, there is a legal requirement that Ireland enforce an effective system of sanctions for dealing with breaches of Community law.  There is sound scientific evidence showing that commercial fishing stocks in Irish waters are at historically low levels and that improved fisheries enforcement and control measures are required to ensure particular fish stocks do not collapse.  During the Second Stage debate on the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 I accepted the necessity for stiff penalties to control serious quota and environmental breaches.  On the other hand, I strongly argued that the use of criminal procedures and penalties to control even minor breaches of technical regulations was the wrong way to go in respect of minor and technical offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">This Bill recognises that serious quota breaches and environmental offences are appropriate targets for the full rigour of fisheries enforcement and no change in these tough enforcement provisions is proposed.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority indicated in its testimony in July 2009 before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that there had been a huge shift towards compliance by the commercial fishing industry.  The authority also confirmed that it would welcome the introduction of a system of administrative sanctions, as recommended by the European Commission.  It is clear from the testimony of the authority that its preferred compliance strategy is to have graded steps towards enforcement and prosecution, ranging from warning letters, administration sanctions and penalty points to criminal penalties for the most serious offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">The commercial fishing industry has responded in a significant and comprehensive way to the quota and environmental requirements of the Common Fisheries Policy.  It is now time for the Government to respond in a sensible and constructive way to the new situation.  The Fine Gael Bill is a timely and reasonable response to the new situation in the commercial fishing industry.  It would provide a mechanism for keeping minor or technical infractions out of the courts.  It would create a process to establish a fixed penalty approach to certain offences.  This would have several advantages, including the promotion of a greater culture of compliance, reduced administrative costs as offences would be dealt with by administrative measures rather than through the courts and the faster conclusion of cases.  It is high time the Government responded to the claim by the commercial sea fishermen and their representative bodies that they have been unfairly targeted with criminal penalties for minor breaches of fishing protection regulations.  The current system of criminal penalties has left fishermen feeling marginalised and demoralised.  They believe they are the only group in society unfairly targeted with serious penalties for minor offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">The Fine Gael Bill provides a way out of the Government's <i>cul-de-sac </i>approach.  The matter has been debated for long enough.  My good friend, Deputy P. J. Sheehan, has been the greatest advocate of the Bill’s approach.  I ask the Minister to resolve a serious concern for coastal communities by taking on board the Fine Gael Bill to introduce administrative sanctions for minor fishing offences.</p>

          <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_671">
            <from>Deputy Jim O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1281">I thank the 22 Members of the House who have contributed to this brief debate on my Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">"Criminal penalties ... should be reserved for persistent and extreme ‘criminal' behaviour.  For the rest, the imposition of administrative penalties ... would be a sufficient deterrent."  Those are not my words, but the words of the UK Prime Minister's Strategy Unit's 2004 report.  Following that report, the UK introduced a Bill exactly along the lines of my Bill, and regulations to underpin it.  It is now in operation in the three jurisdictions of the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">No research has taken place here, except the research we on the Opposition side of the House have conducted.  The Government's opposition to the Bill is totally illogical and borders on the bizarre.  The Government continues its stubborn opposition to any question of administrative sanctions in the face of the incontrovertible evidence that such a system operates successfully in every other EU member state.  That leaves us as the odd man out in Europe, with our total reliance on punitive criminal penalties for even the most minor offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">According to the Government, the EU Commission is wrong in favouring administrative sanctions, and so is the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, even though it is charged with enforcement of fishery law.  The Government by implication condemns the authorities in England and Wales, Marine Scotland and our neighbours in Northern Ireland, which have all recently introduced the approach I am advocating.  The Minister seems to be saying that we should not confuse him with the facts, as his mind is made up.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">The Minister's opposition to the Bill seems to be based on a series of fundamental misapprehensions.  Despite the incontrovertible evidence to the contrary, he insists on applying a simplistic analysis to a nuanced and seriously researched legislative initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">The opposition by Members on the Government benches — such as it is — seems predicated on the same two faulty assumptions that have been the bedrock of Government opposition since 2004.  Those articles of faith, repeated in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, are further muddled by a seeming inability to grasp how the Bill would operate in practice.  The Members opposite have attempted to paint the Bill as a pirate's charter and a carte blanche for unscrupulous fishermen to land whatever they wish while getting off with a €1,000 fine.  That view is sustainable only by a wilful ignorance of the Bill's contents and a refusal to view it as a part of a sophisticated tripartite sanctions approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1287">I will address the Minister's objections.  The Minister has now finally accepted that there is no necessary constitutional impediment to the introduction of administrative sanctions, which was the defence used in the past.  However, he continues to hove to the belief that they would be unconstitutional in the case of fisheries offences — as if what is okay on land is not okay at sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">The Minister's argument is based on the utterly disproportionate fines — even for minor offences — in his own Bill and the 2006 Act.  He uses a circular argument to say that it would therefore be impossible to introduce administrative sanctions for those minor offences.  That is the most ridiculous argument of all time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">Second, it is precisely those gross fines and forfeitures for minor offences that would be unnecessary under this Bill.  They would be dealt with expeditiously in a different way.  The point of the Bill is that the vast swathe of technical offences will be dealt with by administrative sanction, thus rendering the expensive, inefficient, disproportionate and swingeing forfeiture provisions that the Minister hides behind unnecessary in the vast majority of cases.  That is exactly the same way in which we enforce our health and safety regulations and road traffic regulations.  I have yet to hear a single, sensible, domestic, legal and logical argument to the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">The Minister pretends that the European Commission requires us to follow his approach, conveniently ignoring the fact that every report from the European Commission and the European Parliament tells us that administrative sanctions are the way forward.  I will quote from a 2001 European Commission report — the Minister should take a look at it — on the implementation of the CFP.  It states "administrative sanctions appear to have a number of advantages over criminal sanctions", and describes them as the way forward.  I ask why this Government is standing on its own and saying it has the only answer to the problem of fisheries offence enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The European Commission has long accepted that administrative sanctions, backed by criminal penalties for persistent or serious offenders — which I am all for —  is by far the most effective way to enforce fisheries legislation.  The Minister should ask why that system has been introduced in the UK, and in Northern Ireland a couple of years ago.  Is he saying they were wrong, or deliberately trying to damage the fisheries?  That is partly the argument I am hearing from the Government side of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">It is clear that those jurisdictions have examined and consulted on the situation, and come up with the best possible process.  I ask the Minister why we are not doing that here.  We are going back to the same old tired ridiculous arguments that have no substance whatsoever.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">We now come to the nub of the Minister's opposition.  It pains me when I hear it, because it is so wilfully wrong.  It is wrong to argue that the Bill will somehow provide rogue fishermen with a licence to do what they will while paying a €1,000 fine, resulting in the degradation of Ireland's fish stocks.  That objection is based not on anything in the Bill, but on a fantasy bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">We currently have a situation whereby the Naval Service can issue warning letters that have absolutely zero prosecutorial effect.  The Minister seems to think the SFPA has the same authority, but it does not have any legal authority to do that.  It has one authority, which is to come in with a blunderbuss approach for even the most minor offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">I have examined the regulations in other countries and here in Ireland.  Such offences include infringements on twine thickness, trailing of lures, buoyage, flagging of seine nets and marking of vessels.  The only way the SFPA can insist on enforcing those regulations is to bring the offenders to court.  That is the most ridiculous situation of all time.  The end result is that very often nothing is done, and the fishermen and the SFPA know that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">Even worse, an attitude has developed among some fishermen that they might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.  If a fisherman is going to be prosecuted for being 4 kg over the quota, as happened in Donegal recently, he may as well have 400 kg on board.  That is not the way to properly enforce regulations.  It leads to the development of a poisonous relationship between the decent people trying to do their job in the SFPA and the decent people on the other side, the fishermen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">The SFPA wants a better arrangement.  It wants a situation — as it said in evidence before the Oireachtas committee — in which it can operate on the basis of guidance, advice and pressure, using minor penalties like the traffic warden or the people who issue penalty notices for speeding.  It wants to use the heavy weaponry for serious offences.  That is how the system operates in every other country — I ask the Minister why it cannot operate here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">The Minister should recognise that the 2006 Act is neither proportionate nor effective in preserving our fish stocks.  I ask why we are following this route and ignoring what is happening in every other country in the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">In Fine Gael's approach, the role of the Naval Service and the residual jurisdiction of the courts will be retained.  The median swathe of technical regulation that controls every aspect of gear and stowage on board ship will be dealt with in an efficient, effective fashion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">I ask the Minister to go back to the drawing board and consider a sensible approach.  That should be carefully approached and argued, and presented in a reasonable fashion.  I say that for no reason other than that I want a better system that everyone will buy into and that every other country supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">The Government stands alone on the issue.  The approach in the Bill is approved by every other party in the House and — as I know from private discussions, which I cannot disclose — by many of the Minister's colleagues.  It is approved by the European Parliament and the European Commission, and by every other member state in the EU.  It is approved by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and — last but not least — by the fishermen.  I ask the Government to join the people who approved this approach and introduce the kind of system that operates and works effectively in every other country in the European Union.  It can do so by supporting this Bill.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_1452">I wish to raise the issue of the cuts to the dental treatment services scheme.  As Deputies are aware, the scheme is designed to provide basic dental treatment to medical card holders.  While I appreciate the need for budgetary cuts to ensure we get the public finances on the right path, this cut could have been managed far better.  When the Minister for Finance made his Budget Statement on 9 December 2009, the HSE knew that the 2010 budget for this scheme would be €63 million.  However, it decided to wait until 26 April last to issue a directive to dentists on how the scheme might come in under budget for 2010.  Four months of the year had passed by the time any corrective action was taken.  The depth of the cuts was far more severe and harsh than would have been required if corrective action had been taken in December, when the budget for the year was made known.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">It seems from my cursory knowledge of the dental profession that the circular issued on 26 April is unworkable and impractical.  As a result of the circular, a person with a medical card is no longer entitled to a basic cleaning from his or her local dentist.  That is unacceptable.  I will read an excerpt from an e-mail I have received from a dentist I know well:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1454">I am embarrassed when I have to deal with my Medical Card patients because of this HSE directive.  I looked after one of my patients today when he presented in pain.  I was able to relieve the pain by the removal of two infected teeth.  He has had 5 operations on his throat over the last 3 years for cancer treatment and the remaining teeth are in a poor state.  Before the HSE directive arrived, I would have filled 4 of his remaining 7 teeth to preserve them and his dignity and prevent further pain.  Now I must wait under the new terms as these teeth are not causing pain, until he presents in pain, so that I can remove the offending infected and painful tooth.  This will be a gradual and painful exercise that as a caring health care professional I will not tolerate.  This is unethical, unprofessional and unfair.  This patient has no teeth from the lower jaw that meet with the teeth in the upper jaw, that is, he has no teeth to bite with.  Up until a few days ago, I would have gladly made him a set of dentures to improve his ability to chew, speak and give him some dignity in his appearance.  Now I am unable to, unless he qualifies under ‘'approved emergency circumstances'' [as set out in the HSE circular] and I have no idea how and what the qualification for this is.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">That sums up very well the difficulty this directive is presenting to dentists in the profession.  This is a savage cut.  Sufficient funding should be made available to allow basic dental care to be provided to medial card holders.  I call on the Minister to ensure that can be achieved.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DeirdreClune" eId="spk_675">
            <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
            <p eId="para_1456">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue, which has come about following a circular from the HSE dated 26 December 2009.  As Deputy McGrath pointed out, the budget provided that expenditure on the scheme this year would be €63 million.  There was no consultation with the dental profession.  There are four principal dental surgeons in the State and they attempted to engage with the Department and the HSE on the changes they wanted to see implemented but their suggestions were ignored.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">There is a total of 1,352 dentists in the State and a large proportion of their patients hold medical cards.  They are now not entitled to basic routine dental treatments such as scale and polish, cleaning, fillings and extractions.  The new guidelines have been described as "unethical, impossible to operate and a retrograde step in dental care for medical card patients".  We have reached the stage where removal of teeth will be the only option available to many dentists.  Restorative and preventative treatments had advanced to ensure better quality oral care and oral hygiene for patients.  Their general health will be affected by these changes.  Will the Minister review the scheme and how it will be implemented?  In its new guise, it will not serve patients and it will store up a great deal of trouble down the road.  It needs to be addressed and examined to ensure the dental health of patients is protected.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1458">I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  I also met a dentist yesterday who gave me a similar briefing to them.  Clearly the impact of the changes on medical card holders may result in more cost to the State than what may be saved initially.  I intend to engage with the HSE over the next few days to establish what other proposals could be made to ensure people will not be victims of this serious cutback.  I will try to respond to the Deputies as quickly as I can.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">I am happy to have the opportunity to address the issue of the changes to the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS.  The scheme was set up in 1994 and its financial aspects are administered by the primary care reimbursement service on behalf of the HSE.  It is monitored at a local level by HSE principal dental surgeons.  The two objectives of the DTSS are to improve the oral health of adult medical card holders and to provide dental services to adult medical card holders in a cost-effective and equitable manner.  The scheme has provided a range of basic dental treatments to adults who are medical card holders.  These have included routine examinations, fillings, extractions as well as amputation of roots and the provision of dentures.  The service is offered by approximately 1,400 dentists nationwide who hold  contracts with the HSE.  The dental treatment is free to the patients and dentists working in the DTSS are reimbursed on a fee per item basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">Expenditure on the scheme was approximately €85 million in 2009, which was a substantial increase on the 2008 figure of €63.4 million.  In addition, over the past five years expenditure on the DTSS increased by approximately 60%.  In view of this increased expenditure and the current position of the public finances, the Government decided in the context of the budget last December that it was necessary to reduce expenditure on the scheme.  The decision was taken to limit 2010 expenditure to the 2008 level of approximately €63 million.  This reduction in funding reflects the imperative to achieve overall reductions in public expenditure, while providing essential health services to patients and the public.  Having carefully considered the issue, and after obtaining clinical and other advice on the issue, the HSE advised DTSS contracted dentists that the new measures would be introduced from 28 April last.  These changes to the scheme will allow the HSE to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level.  I have taken on board the points made by both Deputies and I will make them aware of the outcome of talks with the HSE within the next two weeks.</p>

          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_677">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_1461">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permission to raise this important matter.  I hope the Minister of State has good news because the Government has spent more than €11.5 million on a state-of-the-art accident and emergency unit in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, which has lain idle since the end of last year.  It is, therefore, in its fifth month without use.  In the meantime, every week dozens of patients lie on trolleys in the hospital.  Patients, staff and the good name of the hospital are suffering as a result.  The hospital has received bad publicity in the past but the medical staff want this facility to work.  The people need the unit, which should have been built five years ago.  It is well behind schedule and we want to look forward to its opening.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">A total of 34 additional staff are needed for the new unit but I understand this is an issue.  The taxpayer has made a commitment to a state-of-the-art facility in the north east and it is imperative that the Government recruits the necessary staff.  The HSE has not made a decision to prevent the unit opening.  It is prepared to hire the staff but the issue is whether the Minister will give consent in order that specialist nursing and care staff can be appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">This week the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> described the appalling conditions in which people must work and in which patients must stay.  A 91-year old lady suffering from Alzheimer’s disease spent more than 28 hours on a trolley while a 70-year old woman spent more than 32 hours on a trolley in recent months.  It is not good enough.  When will the unit open?  Why has consent not been given to recruit staff?  The people of the north east need this facility.  The Government has closed services in Dundalk and Monaghan, which people have not accepted, and there is significant pressure on the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is chock-a-block day and night.  Sick people need the new unit and medical staff, who have waited patiently for many years for this facility are becoming increasingly angry that they have to look at a ghost department.  State-of-the-art beds and equipment are covered in plastic and cannot be used.  Doctors and nurses with tremendous skills need this equipment and they need to provide a service to save lives.  Patient care is suffering as a result.  I hope the Minister of State has good news.</p>

            <p eId="para_1464">I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, who could not be present.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">The transformation programme for the north east involves widespread and fundamental change.  It is designed to build a health system that is in line with the model of care emerging internationally.  This can be achieved by centralising acute and complex care in order that clinical skill levels are safeguarded by ensuring access to a sufficient throughput of cases.  The need to reconfigure health services in the north east was highlighted, along with identified patient safety and quality of care issues, in the 2006 teamwork report to the HSE: Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in theNorth East.  This report demonstrated that the service configuration in the region was unsustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">This report demonstrated that the service configuration in the region was unsustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">The first step in transforming services in the north east is to develop a fully integrated regional health service to ensure that people in the north east have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life saving emergency care.  The HSE began this process with the transfer of acute inpatient services from Monaghan Hospital to Cavan General Hospital on 22 July 2009, which was supported by the opening of the medical assessment unit, MAU, in Cavan General Hospital in March 2009, the development and implementation of an enhanced ambulance and pre-hospital thrombolysis service, together with enhanced primary care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">The immediate focus is now on service reconfiguration in the Louth and Meath area, which involves transferring acute services to Drogheda, strengthening existing medical services, enhancing emergency department capacity, developing appropriate ambulance protocols, completing surgical reconfiguration and providing additional community packages of care.  The new emergency department at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda will provide an improved service to both patients and staff within the Dublin north east region.  This new department, which encompasses best design principles, is approximately 1,300 sq. m in size, and represents a 300% increase in size from the existing department in use today.  The increased size of the department and the specific entrance points will allow patients access the department in a more timely manner by segregating patients at first point of contact with a separate entrance for ambulance and stretcher-borne trauma and another separate entrance for the walking wounded, as it were.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">Once the department opens, all paediatric patients presenting to it will be assessed and treated in a designated paediatric area.  Adult patients will be allocated to one of three distinct assessment and treatment areas; the minor injuries department, the major treatment department and the resuscitation area.  Patients will have more immediate access to diagnostics with an on-site emergency department, dedicated X-ray facility and staff.  Patients will benefit from more immediate treatment, enhanced outcomes and a more patient-focused environment.  Staff will benefit as the new infrastructure and design of the department will facilitate easier access to patients and ultimately earlier admission or discharge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">The increase in size of the emergency department means that staffing levels must be examined.  That is the nub of the issue.  Under the 2010 employment control framework the filling of posts is in the first instance to be by redeployment from within current services.  Once redeployment options have been explored, external recruitment may then proceed in line with this framework.  The HSE is committed to opening the new emergency department at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda at the earliest possible date.  Negotiations are in progress between the HSE and unions in order to agree a mechanism to redeploy staff at all grades and in some instances to consider outsourcing or contracting.  Unfortunately, it has not been possible to reach agreement on these matters to date but the HSE will continue to try to achieve an agreement as quickly as possible in order to open the facility.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_679">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Devins</from>
            <p eId="para_1471">I thank the Acting Chairman and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this motion on the Adjournment tonight.  I welcome the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív, and thank him for attending.  We live in times of great financial difficulty.  At the moment every citizen of our country is suffering from reduced income, in some cases, much reduced income.  The Government is to be commended on taking the corrective action needed to stabilise the national finances, painful and all as it is.  Among the people who have suffered are the recipients of social welfare who have seen a dramatic reduction in their payments.  In the light of the reduced money available to Government, it is essential that those who are genuinely in need of social protection receive it.  We must do all in our power to ensure they are protected from further cuts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">In that context, any abuse of social welfare payments must be eradicated.  In recent months I have become aware of anecdotal evidence of false</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">claims made by some people on social welfare.  That evidence has become stronger recently.  I pay tribute to the citizens who have brought that to my attention, some of whom are themselves social welfare recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">A recent letter in the <i>Irish Independent </i>on 24 April summed up in a succinct way the point I am making.  It asked how a non-national living and working in Norway for the past three years can still receive €600 per month jobseeker’s allowance from the State.  I suggest that the following measures, if implemented, would save a considerable amount of money, which then could be used to protect the genuine recipients of social welfare payments.  We must examine the possibility of ceasing the payment of unemployment benefit-jobseeker’s allowance into bank accounts.  The money should be collected by the recipient presenting himself or herself in person at the post office.  If that is not feasible and the money continues to be paid into a bank account, it should be collected personally in the bank.  Those measures would prevent a serious abuse of the payment system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">We could also introduce a change in the practice of giving one month's notice of signing on.  That could be reduced to one week's notice.  Thus, if someone is out of the country, he or she would not be able to obtain a cheap flight to return to the country to collect the money, thereby making it uneconomic for him or her to claim the allowance while abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The Minister is innovative.  I urge him to devise schemes whereby worthwhile community work could be done by those who are able to work but who through no fault of their own are unemployed.  Such people want to work.  In his previous Ministry the Minister initiated many very good schemes, such as the rural social scheme, which were and still are highly regarded by those who partook in them. Asimilar scheme in this area would be very welcome.  There exists a serious abuse of our social welfare system by a small minority and it is imperative that the majority of social welfare recipients who are genuinely in need of social welfare support are supported.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_680">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_1477">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  As he rightly pointed out, every euro that is fraudulently claimed is a euro taken out of the pockets of those who urgently need those payments.  We must view fraud in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.  I listened with great interest to what the Deputy said and I will examine all of the suggestions he has made.  The expenditure of the Department exceeded €21 billion in 2009 in respect of approximately 50 schemes.  During 2009 the Department processed 2.5 million claims and issued in excess of 83 million payments.  It must be emphasised that the majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">The objective of the Department's control strategy is to ensure that the right person is paid the right amount of money at the right time.  The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department.  Approximately 620 staff work in areas related to control of fraud and abuse of the welfare system.  At the end of 2009 more than 750,000 individual claims were reviewed and the Department recorded control savings of approximately €484 million.  The control savings target for 2010 is €533.31 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480">The level and types of fraud and error vary across schemes but customers typically incur fraud in situations such as failure to disclose their full means or increase in means; failure to disclose the true employment or residential status of their spouse, partner or dependants; claiming jobseeker's payments when they are in fact working; absenting themselves or their dependants being absent from the State; and working while claiming to be incapable of work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">In recent years the Department has undertaken a range of initiatives to tackle the problem, including increased control activity focused on the prevention of fraud and error at claim application stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">This is the most cost effective mechanism of reducing losses through fraud and error in social welfare schemes.  Significant advances have been made to reduce the risk of overpayment through systems "talking" to each other.  With the introduction of the new service delivery modernisation, SDM, a greater number of the Department claims and payments are sharing a single technical platform.  This basically stops double timing and the various systems being abused in that manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">The Department is moving to a risk-based system of claim review, which focuses resources on the most appropriate cases. This involves assigning and recording a risk rating at the award and review stage. In order to identify fraud and error levels in schemes the Department carries out detailed fraud and error surveys on individual schemes which provide evidence-based indicators for levels of fraud and error on those schemes at a particular time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">The Department has also introduced a series of certificate processes in its schemes.  Certificates issue to the customer for completion, for example to targeted customer groups by age, payment method, location or country.  Certificates that fail to be returned or are completed incorrectly may result in suspension or termination of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">As a fraud preventative measure the option to receive payments by electronic fund transfer, into a bank account, was removed for new claimants of jobseeker payments and that addresses one of the Deputy's issues.  Border regions put an increased emphasis on control of claims from applicants with a previous address in Northern Ireland.  One-parent family payment recipients with earnings are the subject of an ongoing review.  Data matching requests to other Departments and agencies is considered a vital tool for targeting effective reviews and successfully achieving savings.  New anti-fraud measures have been included in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009 which provide for the transfer of bulk information relating to recipients of social welfare payments to the competent authority of another member state, international organisation or other country with which reciprocal agreements have been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">One of the anticipated advantages of the introduction of the public service card, which will include a photograph and signature, is that it will help to reduce fraud and error which result from the incorrect identification of benefit claimants.  The special investigation unit of the Department works with other agencies such as Revenue, NERA, Customs and the Garda to ensure that control activity is being targeted at high risk categories of claimants or employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">Since January 2010, members of the public can report suspected social welfare fraud anonymously to the Department by completing a new online form on the Department's website at <i>www.welfare.ie</i>.  The number of anonymous reports from members of the public has increased dramatically, with over 6,400 made at the end of 2009 compared to approximately 1,000 in 2008.  Each report is followed up.  The Department is committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them.  In this regard the control programme of the Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">I assure the Deputy that I will ask my officials to review the suggestions he has made.  We all have a duty to ensure that fraud is minimised so that we can pay those who badly need the support of the State and so that we may retain the money for the targeted groups.  Savings can be used over time to make improvements.  The Deputy has mentioned the various schemes and I am anxious to see when we get the new transfer of powers as regards CE, RSS, CSP schemes whether we can pay fewer people not to work and pay more to be active in community services.</p>

          <heading>Malt Barley Industry</heading>
          <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" eId="spk_681">
            <from>Deputy John Browne</from>
            <p eId="para_1489">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for taking this matter on the Adjournment and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Connick.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">I raise the issue of the growing of malting barley and the future of farmers, particularly in the south-east.  Counties Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Kildare are renowned for growing top-class malting barley.  Due to the recent Greencore rationalisation plan, last year's figure of 11,000 malting barley growers is down to 500 this year.  All farmers producing under 80 tonnes were dumped by Greencore.  Recently the malt side of Greencore has been sold off as well, so it is a double whammy for farmers, particularly in the south east.  The 500 who were left had high expectations that they would have a viable malting barley industry for the future, but while there were 130,000 tonnes for Minch Malt last year the figure this year is 75,000 tonnes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">However, I have raised this matter on the Adjournment to question the commitment of Diageo-Guinness to Irish farmers growing malting barley because of a situation that has developed in recent weeks.  The south east is renowned for growing malting barley and yet Diageo-Guinness has been sidestepping the local supply.  I know for a fact that it has been sourcing malting barley in the UK from a company called Crisp and taking it by lorry to St. James's Gate in Dublin, which is amazing considering the amount of malting barley and malt that is available in Athy at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">I should like to know where we stand with Diageo and the prospect of it continuing to take malt for the future, and malting barley from Irish farmers.  It has shelved its new proposed brewing facility at Grange Castle, Clondalkin and it has not given any great commitment to the farmers as regards the future.  I believe it is a shame that it is now importing barley malt from the UK when there is an adequate supply in this country.  As a result of the importation of the malt, the Athy malt plant was closed for three weeks, which is an amazing situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">I understand Diageo-Guinness is again taking malt from Athy but I would like the Minister of State to ensure that we have a strong commitment from the company in this regard.  Guinness has always been Irish through the generations and it now seems strange that while Guinness is still promoted as being produced from Irish malting barley, supplies are being sourced from England and indeed, Europe, at the present time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">The other area I should like to raise in relation to malting barley is the fact that Heinekan, which now owns Murphys and Beamish, is purchasing no malt at all in Ireland, and yet it, too, is promoting its product as being Irish to the core.  I ask the Minister of State to have discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith,  and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, because both of them are relevant in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1495">As the Acting Chairman appreciates there is a substantial number of jobs in Dublin at St. James's Gate and we want to see Diageo-Guinness continuing to provide jobs and product in Ireland.  We also want it to produce the product but from the adequate amount of malt that is available in this country at the present time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1496">Farmers in the south east have lost the beet industry in recent years.  If they were to lose the malting barley crops in the future, this would have devastating effects on them, in Wexford and the adjoining counties as well.  I ask the Minister of State to have discussions with both Ministers as well as directly with Diageo-Guinness as to where it is going in the future, wherein stands the commitment to the 500 growers — reduced from 11,000 — and about the future of the Athy plant.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanConnick" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_682">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Seán Connick)</from>
            <p eId="para_1497">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  At the outset I should like to thank Deputy Browne for putting down this important matter for discussion tonight.  I share his concern as I have seen the impact of the Greencore decision and the difficulties it is now imposing on farmers, not just in Wexford but in the south east in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">The maintenance in the first instance of an efficient and viable crop sector in Ireland is very important for the well-being of the agrifood industry.  Indigenous production of cereals, horticulture and bio-energy crops is, of course, an important part of primary agricultural production in Ireland.   In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereal sector is a key source of feedstuffs for the livestock sector and, as a consequence, a significant stakeholder in the safety of the food chain.  Annual cereal production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years.  It is desirable to try to sustain this level of production in order to avoid over-dependence on imported cereals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">The Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency, quality and viability of cereal production.  These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended lists of varieties.  In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers.  The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereal producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">At present, up to 130 cereal varieties are undergoing testing in the Department.  This results each year in a number of new and improved varieties being recommended to farmers and industry due to their suitability for malting, milling or bread-making, as the case may be.  While the largest portion of the wheat crop grown in Ireland is used as feed for the livestock industry, a significant acreage of the crop meets the high-quality requirements of the milling industry.  The crop variety testing programme includes extensive evaluation of new varieties for bread-making and biscuit-making quality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">Each year a number of new oat varieties are evaluated under the crop variety testing programme.  These are mainly used in the production of specialised feed, and only those assessed as having high grain quality characteristics are recommended for cultivation.  The demand for organically grown oats for inclusion in breakfast cereals continues to increase.  The Department carries out a number of organic oat cultivation trials each year to identify varieties most suitable for this market.  There is strong interest among commercial organic growers in the results of these trials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">The Department has had a long association with the malting barley industry in Ireland, dating back to the beginning of the 20th century with the introduction of a Guinness-initiated programme of breeding and testing to improve the varieties of malting barley available to Irish growers.  This association was formalised in 1971 when the Department and the company agreed to share the operating costs of the programme.  The programme ceased in 2002, mainly because of the withdrawal of the brewing company.  However, the company continues to purchase malt manufactured from Irish malting barley.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">The malting industry and the Department continue their collaboration in identifying the most suitable barley varieties for malting through the official variety evaluation programme.  Quality issues have arisen recently with regard to protein levels in Irish malting barley, which has resulted in the importation of a small quantity of specialised malt by the company involved.  Officials of the Department have been in communication with grower representatives regarding this protein deficiency issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504">The Department also continues to support the development of the horticulture sector in Ireland.  This support has primarily been provided through the grant aid scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector under the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  The Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, announced last Friday a grant aid package of €3.8 million under the scheme for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">Funding provided under the scheme underpins capital investment on farms to promote the specialisation and diversification of on-farm activities, improve the quality of produce and ensure the application of environmentally friendly practices.  This investment contributes significantly to the growth and development of the horticulture sector across all areas, including the protection of crops, field vegetables, nursery crops, mushrooms, soft fruit, apples and beekeeping.  Additionally, aid for the horticulture sector continues to be available under the capital investment scheme for the marketing and processing of agricultural products.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">Further financial support continues to be available to those producers who participate in the producer organisation scheme.  This EU scheme provides an important mechanism for growers to become part of a larger supply base, to concentrate marketing and improve quality.  Bord Bia continues to provide support to the horticulture sector in its efforts to develop new markets through assistance in the areas of product innovation and marketing skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">The Department has also been providing support to farmers for the production of bio-energy crops.  A pilot bio-energy scheme was launched in 2007 to support the planting of miscanthus and willow by providing assistance to farmers up to a maximum of €1,450 per hectare to cover 50% of establishment costs.  Grants were paid in two instalments: 75% following establishment of the crop and 25% in the year after establishment.  The pilot scheme supported 364 farmers in the planting of some 2,500 hectares consisting of 2,100 hectares of miscanthus and 360 hectares of willow, to the end of 2009, at a cost of some €2.9 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">A new bio-energy scheme, co-funded by the EU under the rural development programme, was launched in February 2010 to build on the progress made during the pilot phase.  Under this scheme, farmers receive a grant up to a maximum of €1,300 per hectare to cover 50% of the establishment costs.  This reflects the reduction in crop establishment costs since the launch of the pilot scheme.  It is expected that a further 850 hectares, consisting of 470 hectares of miscanthus and 380 hectares of willow, will be planted under the scheme for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1509">Deputy Browne will be aware that in February this year the Minister launched a major initiative to draw up a long-term strategy for the agrifood, forestry and fisheries sector.  I assure the Deputy the position of the crop sector will be examined in this context.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_1511">The Deputy will be aware that the Renewed Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to "implement a Code of Practice for doing business in the Grocery Goods sector to develop a fair trading relationship between retailers and their suppliers" and "to review progress of the Code and if necessary to put in place a mandatory code".</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">The Government will give effect to this commitment by including a specific provision in the legislation, currently being prepared to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Conduct in the grocery goods sector.  I expect to publish this legislation later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">As previously indicated to the House by my predecessor, the Tánaiste, the opportunity will be taken in the interim period until the legislation is enacted, to explore with all the relevant stakeholders the possibilities of agreeing a Voluntary Code. In this regard, the Tánaiste had requested the former Attorney General and EU Commissioner, David Byrne, to act as facilitator in leading the discussions with stakeholders in relation to the development of a Voluntary Code. Whilst the possibility of the role of facilitator conflicting with his existing commitments was raised by Mr. Byrne at the time of his appointment by the Tánaiste, he was of the view that any such conflicts, having been declared, could be managed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">Mr. Byrne subsequently advised me that, having reflected further on the matter, he had since come to the view that it would not be possible to satisfactorily manage the role of facilitator in the light of his existing commitments and that he would not, therefore, be in a position to take up the appointment as facilitator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">Whilst I regret that it was not possible for Mr. Byrne to carry out the assignment of facilitator, I fully understand and appreciate his position in this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">I have appointed Mr John Travers as facilitator to engage with stakeholders in relation to the drawing up of a Voluntary Code.  Mr Travers previously served as CEO of Forfás and as acting CEO of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) at its inception.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517">I would urge all stakeholders to engage with the facilitator once appointed as it is through a Voluntary Code that stakeholders have the best opportunity to develop a Code which best respects their interests and which is most suited to the dynamics of the Irish grocery goods sector.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1519">The Government's Asia Strategy spanned ten years, from 1999 to 2009, and has been very successful in developing Ireland's Trade and other links with the key Asian economies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1520">Ireland's exports to the eight priority countries of the final phase of that Strategy rose very significantly, from €4 billion in 1999 to €9.6 billion in 2009, ahead of the target.  We also achieved a five-fold increase in the number of Irish companies with a presence in those countries, from 54 at the start, to 267 in 2009, again ahead of target.  In addition, substantial growth has been achieved on other targets relating to Tourism, specialist food exports, developing inward student numbers, academic partnerships and a range of others.  These outcomes, together with progress in wider awareness-raising, have been greatly assisted by focussed high-level visits.  Over the last five years, Taoiseach-led Trade Missions have been organised to China, India and Japan and other Ministerial-led Trade Missions have taken place to China, India, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore.  In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs has expanded their network of Embassies and Consulates in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">The Government is committed to developing and expanding this engagement, as the key Asian economies represent an exciting and continuously developing market for Irish goods and services.  To this end and in response to the Smart Economy Framework, my Department is both reviewing the achievements of the Asia Strategy, and working with other relevant Departments and the development agencies to prepare a new Trade, Tourism and Investment Plan.  The new Plan will focus on high growth markets such as China, Brazil, the Gulf States, India and Japan, as well as on our existing key trading partners such as the UK, the US and the Eurozone, and its aim will be to increase our economic engagement with these high- growth and high-potential markets.  The Plan, which will be completed by mid-year, will boost our exports and investment performance and bring further focus and coherence to Ireland's single-minded pursuit of our international economic and commercial interests.</p>

            <p eId="para_1523">Jobs and economic growth are about direct and indirect measures.  My Department and the state agencies have a role to play in both directly supporting business and ensuring that the policies pursued across Government are consistent and support our overall national objectives of reducing unemployment, regional development and building the smart economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1524">My Department and it's agencies, interact regularly and intensively via the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal and the Senior Officials Group that underpins it.  The primary purpose of these interactions is to prepare and deliver the actions that have and will continue to drive recovery and growth, and they have a specific focus on employment creation and retention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">In addition, the wide range of direct enterprise agency supports are aimed at improving productivity, market knowledge, competitiveness, and leadership and management capabilities so that firms can compete successfully in international markets and grow their exports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">State supported indigenous companies currently employ 133,000 people.  Enterprise Ireland's objective is to create a further 40,000 new jobs over the next five years.  State supported foreign companies currently employ 124,000 people.  IDA's objective is to create a further 62,000 new jobs over the next five years.  The IDA and EI targets for job creation could lead to an additional 70,000 jobs elsewhere in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">In addition, the County and City Enterprise Boards support micro-enterprises across the country.  Companies supported under the Employment Subsidy Scheme and the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund have committed to maintaining over 100,000 jobs to the end of November 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">We are also supporting companies with direct funding for R&amp;D and through the recently enhanced R&amp;D tax credit. Enterprise Ireland and IDA support companies ranging from Innovation Vouchers to large scale research programmes.  We are funding collaborative research partnerships between companies and partnering companies with the strong science base we have built through PRTLI and Science Foundation Ireland.  SFI funded researchers now work with over 300 companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">However, the relocation of businesses within particular types of industry is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland.  We successfully manage this process, through our policies on enterprise and foreign direct investment.  These policies have enabled us to win many prestigious and value added investments, and have enabled us to replace lost jobs with others of equal or higher value in the economy.  New jobs created in the enterprise development agencies' client companies in the last number of years are heavily concentrated in high-value added, knowledge-based companies that offer higher salaries and greater security in the face of intense international competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">Since the onset of the global downturn, Agencies and groups associated with my Department such as Forfás, EI, IDA, the National Competitiveness Council have examined the underlying factors affecting mobile international investment and Ireland's competitive position.  Specific actions to both protect jobs and create opportunities for employment in the future are set out in the reports such as that on Green Enterprise and the Innovation Taskforce.  My Department is driving the implementation of prioritised recommendations in conjunction with my Government colleagues.</p>

            <p eId="para_1532">The <i>Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008 — 2009</i> (paras 9.1 — 9.3) provides for the establishment of a review process to consider the legal and other steps necessary to enable the employee representation mechanisms that had been established under previous agreements — and in legislation — to operate as they had been intended. In furtherance to this commitment, two informal meetings took place late last year, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and at which my Department; the Department of Finance; trade unions; and employers were represented. Position papers were prepared by the employer and trade union representatives on the issues which they saw as requiring to be addressed by any new legislation in this area. While consideration will continue within Government on proposals to address the issues involved, progress in bringing the work to a conclusion will have to take account of other priority legislative commitments to be delivered in the employment area, resource constraints within Departments, and the extent of agreement between the trade union and employer sides in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1534">The Government is working hard to sustain and create jobs all over the country by creating a business environment that is supportive of enterprise. The enterprise development agencies play a key role in stimulating the development of new businesses, facilitating the expansion of existing companies, and targeting new foreign direct investment through a broad range of initiatives. Since 2008, Enterprise Ireland has approved €50m approx. to client companies in Cork City and County. Enterprise Ireland has a client base of over 700 companies in County Cork employing circa 18,000 people. EI provides a range of supports that includes the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund, seed and venture capital funds, research and development funds, greentech support and the lean business initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">The CEB in South Cork provides support to small businesses in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level throughout the area. Between 1993 and 2009, the CEB has provided over €6.1m in grant assistance to 451 clients. Their grant intervention has assisted in the creation of 916 jobs in the area. In addition 3,016 people have participated in South Cork CEB training programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">CEB assistance in the Youghal area has included support of an enterprise centre, direct grant support to eligible micro-enterprises, the promotion of enterprise related activities and of an enterprise culture in Youghal through networking and business development activities. Grant assistance to eligible micro-enterprises was approved to the value of €352,000 approx in 2008 and  €486,000 in 2009. Projects in the Youghal area were approved grants to the value of €57,500 in 2008 and €30,000 in 2009. In addition, it's estimated that 3,676 people are employed in IDA client companies in the East Cork area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">The effectiveness of the agencies in job creation must also take into account the indirect effects of their activities.  It is generally estimated that the jobs directly created result in approximately the same number of jobs being generated in the local economy. However, we cannot be complacent and I can assure the Deputy that I am examining the potential for State agencies to take a more collaborative approach to sectoral and enterprise development and in particular to implement the findings of the Forfas Regional Competitiveness Report for the South West.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1539">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Under Redundancy legislation, all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant. As a general rule, a redundancy situation exists where an employer requires fewer employees to do work of a particular kind, where a company goes into liquidation/receivership, where it is decided to rationalise/reorganise a company or, of course, where a company closes down. Other examples would include partial closing down of a company, a decrease in an employer's requirements for workers of a particular kind and skills/qualifications or, an employer's requirements for fewer employees due to prevailing economic conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1540">Entitlement to statutory redundancy payments are governed by the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007. In particular, Sections 7 to 9 of the Act set out the circumstances in which a redundancy situation applies. Section 9 specifically provides that dismissal by way of redundancy applies in the circumstance that the contract of employment is terminated. It provides moreover that an employee is not considered to be dismissed by his employer if the contract of employment is renewed, or he is re-engaged by the same employer under a new contract of employment where the conditions of employment do not differ from those of the previous contract and the contract takes effect immediately on the ending of the previous employment contract or, where renewal or re-engagement is offered within a period of four weeks from the ending of the previous contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1541">In any instance where my Department is unsure, on the basis of claims made, whether a genuine redundancy situation exists, my Department will pursue this with the employer concerned. My Department also has the option, if there is any element of doubt relating to the existence of a redundancy situation, of referring cases to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a decision. My Department is not aware of any cases in which statutory redundancy was paid out this year or any year where the redundancies were not of a genuine nature.</p>

            <p eId="para_1543">My predecessor an Tánaiste published the policy statement ‘Jobs and Growth 2010' in March.  This Statement brings together the Government's key strategies for growth, economic renewal and the development of a sustainable, internationally trading enterprise base for the creation of jobs.  The Strategy focuses on the policies and actions which are being taken in a number of critical areas:</p>

            <p eId="para_1550">The green economy; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">Trade and markets The Government has also implemented a comprehensive economic strategy that includes addressing the issue of budgetary sustainability. It has at its heart policies targeted at new, sustained growth in business, exports and jobs, based on increasing levels of productivity, competitiveness and innovation. These are the policies that are firmly at the top of my agenda as the new Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp; Innovation, and I believe that these policies will continue to show results. Under the Enterprise Subsidy Scheme, we are investing approximately €133 million to support 1696 companies, who have committed to maintain over 100,000 jobs.  Under the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund, 193 companies have been approved a total of €72 million, of which €64 million has been paid out up to 30 April 2010.  The remaining €6 million under this scheme is expected to be allocated over the next few months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">We are already seeing a recovery in cost competitiveness with lower business costs, particularly wages and energy. We are reducing the administrative burden by driving better regulation. We are targeting R&amp;D and Innovation to drive productivity and ensure that we have the skills and technologies available in Ireland that will give us a competitive advantage. We are focussed on opportunities for growth in a number of key sectors. For example, the Green Enterprise report estimated that 80,000 new jobs could be created in the coming years. My priority is to ensure that the business environment is supportive of Irish enterprise and export growth and also reinvigorates Ireland's international standing to encourage high value foreign investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1588">Since January 2008, Ireland has regained competitiveness as domestic inflation remains below that of our main trading partners and the euro weakened — in February 2010, Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (HCI) was back to its January 2005 position. Improving our relative cost competitiveness requires the cost of doing business in Ireland to fall relative to that of our trading partners. Data which will be published shortly by the NCC will show that prices in Ireland have moderated in the past year, particularly property and energy prices.  In addition, at an economy wide level, Irish labour wage rates — when adjusted for productivity — are becoming more cost competitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1589">In parallel to the fundamental steps taken over the past 18 months to stabilise the public finances and restore the banking system, the necessary price adjustment to restore competitiveness is underway. Business costs have fallen: wage bills, asset prices, energy and prices in general have responded to the effects of recession and corrective government action. This is resulting in improvements to cost competitiveness across the economy in the manufacturing and services sectors. Further strengthening Ireland's competitive position will foster economic growth.  I am working with my colleagues in Government to further embed the improvements already achieved and to strengthen Ireland's relative international competitiveness position.</p>

While there is no obligation on my part to legislate in respect of any recommendation from the CLRG, the main focus of the Group's work to date has been in relation to the General Scheme of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill which was published in July 2007. The Government subsequently approved the drafting of a Bill along the lines of the General Scheme. The proposed Bill will consolidate all the existing Irish Companies Acts, dating from 1963 to 2009, as well as other regulations and common law provisions relating to the incorporation and operation of companies, into a single Act comprising more than 1,300 sections. Given its size and complexity it is envisaged that the Bill will be published in the Autumn 2011 at the earliest.</p>

It is intended that responsibility for the national employment service (including the local employment service) and employment programmes will move from the Department of Education and Skills to the Department for Social Protection under a further Government order to be made in due course. Responsibility for the redundancy and insolvency payment schemes currently resides with my Department pending the making of a Government order to transfer these functions to the Department of Social Protection. In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims. There will be full engagement between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills in the necessary planning and organising to achieve a seamless transfer of functions.</p>

            <p eId="para_1596">I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 85 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">The development of Ireland as an Innovation Hub is a key priority of the Government's economic recovery framework.  The Innovation Taskforce has put forward a road map to make Ireland: the best place in Europe to turn research and knowledge into products and services; the best place in Europe to start and grow an innovative company; the best place to relocate or expand and scale an SME; the best place in Europe for research-intensive multinationals to collaborate with each other and with clusters of small companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">Recent changes in Departmental structures have brought innovation to the fore in my new Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Government has agreed that I personally chair a High Level Implementation Committee to oversee implementation of the Report of the Innovation Taskforce, as published in March. This reflects the highest political priority that is being afforded to the implementation of this report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">The membership of the Implementation Committee will comprise a number of private sector members, including representatives from the Innovation Taskforce and some members of the Enterprise Feedback Group for the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation which will be subsumed into this new Committee.  The Implementation Committee will also include the Secretaries General of key Government Departments.  The CEOs of key agencies will also participate in the work of the Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">I envisage a first meeting of the Implementation Committee at an early date and regular meetings thereafter.  Each of my Ministerial colleagues has been asked to prioritise the implementation of recommendations from the Taskforce report for which they are responsible. Particular attention will be given to those recommendations from the Taskforce Report which can be implemented in the shorter term and work is already underway on a number of such recommendations.  I will report on our work on a regular basis to the Taoiseach and the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal.</p>

            <p eId="para_1602">The County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) have primary responsibility for the delivery of State support to the indigenous micro-enterprise sector i.e. businesses which employ 10 or less workers. In the current economic climate, entrepreneurship, and the growth and development of small Irish businesses, is central to economic recovery and it is essential that Irish enterprises continue to be supported. The CEBs play a key role in this regard and their priorities for 2010 are to assist owner/managers in enhancing the survival and sustainability of their businesses in these difficult economic times and to assist people wishing to start their own business including those made redundant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1603">To enable the CEBs to fulfil their role I have secured funding of over €28m for the network of CEBs of which €14.9m has been allocated for Capital expenditure. During 2010 the CEBs will ensure that this funding is targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.  This will be done not just by direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters but also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">My Department, in association with the CEB Central Coordination Unit within Enterprise Ireland (CCU), and with the CEB network, will continue to monitor the level of funding and range of support services offered by the CEBs to the micro-enterprise sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1606">Government policy on banking has been to return the banks to a position where they can access funds and lend these funds on to viable businesses and households to support enterprise growth and economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1607">The Government has taken decisive action in order to get credit flowing again.  The Bank Guarantee Scheme, the 2009 Recapitalisation Scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Banks and the establishment of the National Assets Management Agency have all contributed to the stabilisation of the banking sector with a view to facilitating the flow of credit. The 2010 Recapitalisation package builds on the earlier initiatives and includes additional supports for enterprises, including SMEs. In particular, AIB and Bank of Ireland have both committed to making available not less than €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011. This must include funds for working capital for businesses. Both banks must each produce a plan that includes a sectoral and geographic breakdown of how they intend to divide up this new lending.  This will be a significant increase on the figures reported by the banks for 2009 and will help to sustain the economy and foster growth. This figure can be reviewed as the needs of the economy change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1608">In the past, Irish banking has focused too much on property-related lending and our banks have not been very well acquainted with our modern economic sectors. In order to change this, under the new Recapitalisation arrangements, the banks are required to work closely with Enterprise Ireland to improve their expertise.  Specifically they are required to: commit resources to work with Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Banking Federation to develop sectoral expertise in the modern growth sectors of the Irish economy; explore with Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Banking Federation how best to develop the range of banking services that Irish SMEs trading internationally will need; and develop expertise and bring forward new credit products in areas where cashflow, rather than property or assets, is the basis for business lending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1609">The Credit Review Office headed up by John Trethowan will examine the credit policies and practices of the banks, particularly for SMEs. The Office is also open to review cases where credit has been refused to viable companies and to make appropriate recommendations to the relevant bank concerned.  The Government has also introduced a number of initiatives to improve the availability of credit to the small business sector.  The Finance Act 2010 provided for the start-up company exemption to be extended into 2010 encouraging both entrepreneurship and economic activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1610">The Enterprise Stabilisation Fund was established by Government in 2009, as a 2-year scheme to support viable but vulnerable exporting companies experiencing difficulties because of the economic climate. The fund supplies direct financial support to internationally trading enterprises by supporting their drive to reduce costs and through increased competitiveness, gain sales in overseas markets.  In 2009, €58m was spent on 180 projects.  To date in 2010, 13 companies have been approved for funding under this initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">The Government is also encouraging employers to create new jobs through reducing the costs associated with employment through the Employer Jobs (PRSI) Incentive Scheme.  For each new eligible job, the scheme gives an 8%-10% saving on employment costs for the first year of employment.  This will actively encourage the creation of new employment now when it is most needed.  Work is also under way in my Department on the examination of a possible scheme of Loan Guarantees for the SME sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">The Government places a high priority on supporting entrepreneurship and growing Irish owned business.  The State support agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and the network of 35 City and County Enterprise Boards, are working hard to support and maintain existing business and to help those people who want to start new businesses.  Government will continue to monitor the banks' response to providing credit to SMEs to ensure that the significant assistance provided to stabilise the banks results in a proper functioning banking system which supports enterprise development and facilitates Ireland's ability to benefit from a general upturn in international markets.</p>

The issue of amending the Competition Act 2002 to facilitate such negotiations is being examined in the context of the Consumer and Competition Bill, which I hope to publish later this year. This Bill will, <i>inter alia</i>, give effect to the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority.  In addition, an amendment to competition law to give effect to the Government commitment under “<i>Towards 2016</i>” regarding the exemption of certain specified categories of vulnerable workers (voice-over actors, freelance journalists and session musicians) from competition law will also be considered in the context of this Bill.

            <p eId="para_1617">Ireland is totally committed to taking persistent, determined and effective measures to eradicate torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through our work in the EU and in other international fora such as the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">Ireland signed the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) on 28 September 1992, and ratified it on 11 April 2002.  Ireland also signed and ratified the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment on 14 March 1988 and signed and ratified both Optional Protocols to the Convention on 10 April 1996.</p>
            <p eId="para_1619">Ireland's commitment to eradicating torture is further demonstrated through our support for the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture.  In the past six years, Ireland has given more than €1 million to the Voluntary Fund.  Council Regulation No 1236/2005 concerning trade in certain goods that could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is implemented in Ireland by means of Statutory Instrument No. 488 of 2005.  This legislation prohibits the export of goods, which have no practical use other than for the purpose of capital punishment or for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Regulations list the products whose export or import is prohibited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">Under the Regulations an authorisation is required for any export of listed goods that could be used for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  No export authorisation has been either sought from or granted by my Department for any of the products listed in the Regulations. Furthermore, to reinforce our serious concerns about any trade in these goods, Customs spot check for any trade flows of products that have similar trade identification codes to ensure, that as far as possible, there is no circumvention of these vital controls.</p>

In the interim, until the necessary legislation can be enacted, it is intended to take the opportunity to explore with all the relevant stakeholders the possibilities of agreeing a Voluntary Code. In this regard, the Tánaiste had requested the former Attorney General and EU Commissioner, David Byrne, to act as facilitator in leading the discussions with stakeholders in relation to the development of a Voluntary Code. Whilst the possibility of the role of facilitator conflicting with his existing commitments was raised by Mr. Byrne at the time of his appointment by the Tánaiste, he was of the view that any such conflicts, having been declared, could be managed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">Mr. Byrne subsequently advised me that, having reflected further on the matter, he had since come to the view that it would not be possible to satisfactorily manage the role of facilitator in the light of his existing commitments and that he would not, therefore, be in a position to take up the appointment as facilitator.  Whilst I regret that it was not possible for Mr. Byrne to carry out the assignment of facilitator, I fully understand and appreciate his position in this matter. I have appointed John Travers as facilitator, to engage with stakeholders in relation to the drawing up of a voluntary code.  I would urge all stakeholders to engage with the facilitator as it is through a Voluntary Code that stakeholders have the best opportunity to develop a Code which best respects their interests and which is most suited to the dynamics of the Irish grocery goods sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1627">The <i>Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008 — 2009</i> (paras 9.1 — 9.3) provides for the establishment of a review process to consider the legal and other steps necessary to enable the employee representation mechanisms that had been established under previous agreements — and in legislation — to operate as they had been intended.

Position papers were prepared by the employer and trade union representatives on the issues which they saw as requiring to be addressed by any new legislation in this area.  While consideration will continue within Government on proposals to address the issues involved, progress in bringing the work to a conclusion will have to take account of other priority legislative commitments to be delivered in the employment area, resource constraints within Departments, and the extent of agreement between the trade union and employer sides in this area.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation" eId="spk_702">
            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_1630">The proposal for a Consumer Rights Directive was published in October 2008 and brings together in updated and consolidated form four existing Directives on doorstep selling, distance sales, consumer sales and guarantees, and unfair contract terms.  Unlike the Directives it is intended to replace, the proposal has been drafted on a full harmonisation basis and, if adopted on this basis, would preclude member states from going beyond its protections in national legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1631">In the case of a complex proposal like the proposed Consumer Rights Directive, arriving at an overall assessment of its implications for consumer rights is not a straightforward matter. Some proposals, such as the proposed extension of the withdrawal period for distance and off-premises contracts from seven to fourteen days and the provision that risk would pass with delivery in consumer sales contracts, would enhance Irish consumer rights.  Other provisions, such as those on unfair contract terms, broadly reflect the existing legal position here and would neither enhance nor diminish consumer rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">Concerns about the proposal's impact for consumer rights in Ireland centre mainly on its provisions on consumer remedies for faulty goods and in particular, as the Deputy's question suggests, on their implications for what is known as the right to reject.  By this is meant the right to return faulty goods, obtain a refund of the price, and, in so doing, to terminate the contract.  This is a well-established feature of our sale of goods law and, though qualified by quite complex provisions on the acceptance and rejection of goods, is an important safeguard for consumers and one that materially strengthens their hand in dealing with recalcitrant traders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">Though the proposed Directive makes provision for a broadly similar right to rescind the contract where goods are faulty, this applies only where the primary remedies of repair or replacement are unlawful, impossible or disproportionate, or are not made available by the trader, or fail to remedy the defect within a reasonable time or without significant inconvenience to the consumer, or if the same defect recurs more than once within a short period of time.  A fully harmonised provision along these lines would, if adopted, mean that the right to reject would be a remedy of second rather than first resort for faulty goods.  Though consumers are satisfied in many cases with the repair or replacement of faulty goods, the relegation of the right to reject to the status of a secondary remedy would have, and would be seen to have, an adverse effect on Irish consumer rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">The Sales Law Review Group, which was established in November 2008, in order, among other things, to assess the implications of the proposed Directive for Irish consumer rights and law, produced a comprehensive assessment of the proposal in a position paper published in July. Though the Review Group acknowledged the positive elements in the proposal, it stated that the provisions on remedies for faulty goods and a related provision that would reduce the liability period for faulty goods under Irish law from six to two years presented ‘the greatest threat to the protections currently enjoyed by Irish consumers'.  My Department has taken careful note of the points made by the Review Group and the Group's assessment has been of considerable benefit in informing our approach to the discussions on the proposed Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">I would like to assure the Deputy that my officials have expressed our concerns about the relevant aspects of the proposed Directive in clear and forthright terms.  Those concerns were restated at political level in a policy debate on the proposed Directive at the Competitiveness Council in December 2009.  It is important to recognise however that discussions on the proposed Directive have a considerable way to go at both official and Ministerial level and in the European Parliament.  The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection of the European Parliament is currently considering the proposal, and the proposal is expected to have a first reading in the Parliament before the end of the year.  While I am not in a position to disclose the state of play of discussions on the proposed Directive, I can say that the European Commission is fully aware of our and other member states' concerns about aspects of the proposal.  In an address to the European Consumer Day Conference on 15 March 2010, Vice-President Reding who now has responsibility for the proposal stated that ‘it is clear that the proposal as it is today does not offer the right level of protection on all issues' and expressed a willingness to work with the Parliament and the Member States to see whether ‘increasing the level of protection for certain rules would lead to a better outcome for consumers, without putting too high a burden on businesses'.</p>

            <p eId="para_1641">My Department condemn any practices by employers that may result in non-compliance with employment rights entitlements or any other mistreatment of employees including those on employment permits.  Ireland's Employment Rights Legislation establishes the statutory rights applicable to all people working in Ireland whether they are Irish citizens or otherwise.  I would urge all whose employment rights are being breached by an employer or those who know of such exploitation, to contact the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).</p>
            <p eId="para_1642">The Employment Permits Act 2006 sets out in legislation the rules governing employment permits.  One of the main focuses of this Act was in increasing the rights and protections afforded to migrant workers and the means to ensure redress in the event of exploitative practices.  The Act's provisions gave immigrants greater freedom, autonomy and control over their own employment choices by enabling workers for the first time to apply and re-apply for their own permit and allowing workers to change their employer after a period of a year and move to another employment in order to take advantage of better conditions or career options.  Last year, my Department issued almost 1,500 employment permits in respect of employees changing to new employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1643">The Employment Permits Act 2006 allows for regular review of Ireland's economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review, in line with the emerging needs of the labour market, on an on-going basis.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_1673">I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 88 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">Table 1 sets out the number of redundancy claims received in the years 2002 to 2009 and provisional figures up to end April 2010.  These figures reflect the number of employees who actually qualified for statutory redundancy lump sum payments.  They do not reflect those who lost their jobs with less than two years service in employment.  It is not possible to project the number of redundancies which will arise in 2010 as this will depend on a number of factors, including economic factors and the rate of recovery in the economy.  However, the figures available for the first four months of 2010 suggest that the pattern, at an average weekly intake of 1,400 new claims is down on the weekly average of 1,500 claims experienced in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">Table 2 sets out the monies paid out of the Social Insurance Fund in respect of redundancy claims for the years 2002-2009 and provisional figures up to end April 2010.  It is not possible to project the amount which will be paid out in 2010 as this will hinge on a number of variables including the number of claims received, the length of service of the claimants etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">Figures available to the end of April 2010 indicate that the number of redundancy claims on hand and awaiting processing stands at 36,333.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate claims submitted from September so that the waiting time is approximately 7 months.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating also from September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include: almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents; prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; establishment of a special call<b> </b>handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments; better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department’s website; engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008, and made corresponding payments totalling €336m which results in average weekly payments to the value of €6.5m being issued.  In the period 2007 — 2009, the level of new claims lodged with my Department has increased cumulatively by 200%.  This contrasts with the previous two-year period 2005 — 2007 in which period the increase in new claims lodged was just 10%.  During the period 1 January 2010 to 30 April, 2010, 23,593 claims were received and 27,592 were processed to the value of €159m which is a weekly average of €9.4m.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">Responsibility for the payment of redundancy and insolvency payments is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  The intention is to transfer by Government order, the payment functions arising under the Redundancy Payment and Insolvency Payment schemes.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims<b>.</b>

            <p eId="para_1726">Jobs and economic growth are about direct and indirect measures.  My Department and the state agencies have a role to play in both directly supporting business and ensuring that the policies pursued across Government are consistent and support our overall national objectives of reducing unemployment, regional development and building the smart economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">My Department and its agencies, interact regularly and intensively via the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal and the Senior Officials Group that underpins it. The primary purpose of these interactions is to prepare and deliver the actions that have and will continue to drive recovery and growth, and they have a specific focus on employment creation and retention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">In addition, the wide range of direct enterprise agency supports are aimed at improving productivity, market knowledge, competitiveness, and leadership and management capabilities so that firms can compete successfully in international markets and grow their exports.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">State supported indigenous companies currently employ 133,000 people.  Enterprise Ireland's objective is to create a further 40,000 new jobs over the next five years.  State supported foreign companies currently employ 124,000 people.  IDA's objective is to create a further 62,000 new jobs over the next five years.  The IDA and EI targets for job creation could lead to an additional 70,000 jobs elsewhere in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1730">In addition, the County and City Enterprise Boards support micro-enterprises across the country.  Companies supported under the Employment Subsidy Scheme and the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund have committed to maintaining over 100,000 jobs to the end of November 2010.  We are also supporting companies with direct funding for R&amp;D and through the recently enhanced R&amp;D tax credit.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA support companies ranging from Innovation Vouchers to large scale research programmes.  We are funding collaborative research partnerships between companies and partnering companies with the strong science base we have built through PRTLI and Science Foundation Ireland. SFI funded researchers now work with over 300 companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">However, the relocation of businesses within particular types of industry is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland.  We successfully manage this process, through our policies on enterprise and foreign direct investment.  These policies have enabled us to win many prestigious and value added investments, and have enabled us to replace lost jobs with others of equal or higher value in the economy. New jobs created in the enterprise development agencies' client companies in the last number of years are heavily concentrated in high-value added, knowledge-based companies that offer higher salaries and greater security in the face of intense international competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">Since the onset of the global downturn, Agencies and groups associated with my Department such as Forfás, EI, IDA, the National Competitiveness Council have examined the underlying factors affecting mobile international investment and Ireland's competitive position.  Specific actions to both protect jobs and create opportunities for employment in the future are set out in the reports such as that on Green Enterprise and the Innovation Taskforce.  My Department is driving the implementation of prioritised recommendations in conjunction with my Government colleagues.</p>

         when he expects to publish the legislation promised in a newspaper interview (details supplied) on 17 March 2009 to clamp down on crony capitalism, to restrict cross-directorships and to prevent one person fulfilling the dual role of chair and chief executive of any company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1734">The remarks attributed to the Minister for Finance in the interview in question would, no doubt, have been made with the banking sector in particular in mind.  Policy responsibility for the banking sector is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.  In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator have launched a consultation paper recently on corporate governance standards for financial institutions and credit undertakings.  The matters referred to by the Deputy are among the issues being addressed in the consultation paper.  The Financial Regulator has invited interested parties to comment by 30 June 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">In the area of company law that falls within my responsibility, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is currently drafting the Company Law Consolidation and Reform Bill. It sets out the corporate duties of directors, company secretaries and auditors on a general basis across all sectors.  The Bill will implement the recommendations of the Company Law Review Group in that the fiduciary duties owed by directors to the company will be stated in the new companies code.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">At present company law does not prohibit cross directorships, whereby a person is a director of more than one company at the same time.  The general position is that a person may not be a director of more than 25 companies subject to certain specific exceptions. Directorships of public limited companies (plcs) are not included in the limit of 25.  Any consideration of a change in this position for the general cohort of companies operating in Ireland would need to take account of the contribution that non-executive directors make by imparting their mix of expertise and the cross fertilisation of ideas from other areas of the business community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">The Companies Acts do not prevent a person fulfilling the dual role of chair and chief executive of a company.  This would in my opinion be unworkable for smaller companies. However, the Combined Code of Corporate Governance which applies to companies whose securities are listed and traded on the Irish Stock Exchange does provide that the roles of chairman and chief executive should not be exercised by the same individual.  The "comply or explain" principle, which is now enshrined in law under Statutory Instrument 450 of 2009, requires companies to meet the best practice guidelines or explain publicly why not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">The Government is committed to ensuring that our corporate governance regime for the corporate sector generally, accords with best international practice.  We will take account of the lessons which emerge from current enquiries and reviews arising from recent developments and we will address, as appropriate, any concerns in this area including by way of legislation if necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_1740">The Enterprise Stabilisation Fund (ESF) was established by Government in 2009 as a 2 year scheme to support viable but vulnerable exporting companies experiencing difficulties because of the current economic climate.  Some €78m is currently being provided under the ESF for 2009 and 2010. At the 30th April 2010, 197 projects from 193 companies had been approved €72m under the ESF, of which €64m has been paid out to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">As with any budget process, the 2010 budget exercise necessitated taking account of emerging priorities as regards enterprise support. In this context, priority is being given to a wide range of financial supports for SMEs, including R&amp;D grants, supporting companies, which are resuming a growth path, and providing assistance in developing lean manufacturing processes.  Prioritisation is always necessary and in this instance it was clearly appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">The Irish economy is now entering a recovery phase and we must take this into account in the allocation of funding across the range of Enterprise Ireland programmes.  The companies that Enterprise Ireland is now assisting includes those that are still vulnerable but just as importantly, those that have shown their potential for high growth and increased export sales.  This balance between supporting those companies which are still vulnerable and those, which are ready to grow, is the key to stabilising the position of some companies while facilitating others taking advantage of the opportunities presented by the recovery in global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">The overall funding allocated to Enterprise Ireland for company supports in 2010 amounts to €278m, which represents a 26% increase on the outturn for 2009.  This increase is a reflection of the Government's commitment to supporting enterprise in whatever form is necessary as our priorities shift over the coming year.  Allocations to particular schemes are kept under constant review and adjusted to meet our economic needs at any given point in time.</p>

Three of these Directives are currently overdue: (i) Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual and consolidated accounts (due to be transposed shortly);  (ii) Directive 2008/112/EC on classification, labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (due to be transposed shortly) and (iii) Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market (due to be transposed by mid June 2010).</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">I have emphasised to officials in my Department the necessity to transpose directives at the earliest opportunity.  I have put additional measures in place to ensure that this happens and will be monitoring progress going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_1755">In relation to my Department, the main rationalisation relates to the decision to merge the National Consumer Agency (NCA) and the Competition Authority.  At the time the merger of the two bodies was announced, work on the review of the operation and implementation of the 2002 Competition Act was well underway.  The submissions received following a public consultation process were being considered as was the report and recommendations of the Advisory Group on Media Mergers.  Rather than give effect to the amalgamation of the Authority and NCA in a stand-alone piece of legislation, to be followed in due course by legislation to amend, reform and update the 2002 Act, it was decided to introduce a single comprehensive Bill.  This Bill will include provisions, not only to create the new consumer and competition body, but also to:</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">update the existing competition law;</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">strengthen the public interest test in respect of media mergers, in line with the report of the Advisory Group on Media Mergers;</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">make some minor amendments to the consumer protection legislation;</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">enable the drawing-up of a statutory code of conduct for the grocery goods sector; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">give effect to the Government commitment under "<i>Towards 2016</i>” regarding the exemption of certain specified categories of vulnerable workers from competition law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">I hope to publish this Bill later in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">Separately, the Irish Council for Bioethics (ICB) which was established in May 2002, as an independent, autonomous, non-statutory body, to consider the ethical issues in science and medicine raised by developments in biotechnology has until this year been funded by my Department.  The future position of ICB was reviewed in the context of the general review of expenditure undertaken across all sectors in 2009 by the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (the McCarthy Report), and the outcome of this review was to the effect that "D/ET&amp;E proposed a saving of €0.4m through discontinuing the funding of the Irish Council for Bioethics and this is accepted by the Special Group".  The Report also indicated that the further issue of assigning some of the Council's functions to the health sector would have to be considered, if necessary, by the Department of Health &amp; Children within existing expenditure and staff resources.  Having regard to the recommendations in the McCarthy Report and in the light of other pending Government initiatives, the Tánaiste, in her then capacity as Minister responsible for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's vote, agreed with the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance earlier this year that the three staff in the secretariat to the ICB should be seconded to the Department of Health and Children, so that their expertise could be availed of appropriately.  The funding allocation that had been made available to my Department for 2010 has accordingly been transferred to the Department of Health and Children of foot of this agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to examine recommendations for the rationalization of other agencies as recommended in the McCarthy Report.  Public Sector reform is a key competitiveness issue and I will be keeping this matter under constant review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1765">The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation applies to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1766">In 2009, €2.5 million in unpaid wages was recovered by NERA for over 6,000 workers.  This would have included both indigenous and migrant workers who were identified as having been paid less than their statutory minimum entitlement under both the Industrial Relations and Minimum Wage legislation.  While the amount recovered for individual employees varied significantly, the average amount paid was approximately €410 per employee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">Code of Practice</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">A Code of Practice for Protecting Persons Employed in Other People's Homes has also been prepared under the Industrials Relations Acts 1990.  The code seeks to:</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">Set out certain employment rights and protections for persons employed in other people's homes;</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">Encourage good practice and compliance with the law concerning the employment of persons in other people's homes; and</p>

            <p eId="para_1772">Provision of Information</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">NERA Inspectors play an important role in promoting employment rights in the course of their inspection activity.  As part of that process, Inspectors, where appropriate, inform both employers and employees of their respective obligations and rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">NERA provides this information through a variety of channels.  The telephone information service provides a 24-hour a day service, offering callers the option to listen to recorded information on key employment rights topics at a time that suits them.  NERA's website (www.employmentrights.ie) is a much-used information resource, recording over 1.5 million web page impressions during 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">NERA also provides a broad range of information through booklets and leaflets. These include <i>’Guide to Inspections’ </i>and <i>’Guide to Employment Rights’ </i>leaflets, a booklet entitled <i>’Employment Law Explained’ </i>and a publication entitled <i>’Starting or Expanding a Business’</i>.  All of these booklets are available free of charge from NERA and may also be viewed and downloaded from the NERA website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">As part of NERA's continuing commitment to provide fully accessible information and services to all its customers, NERA proactively provides information by participating in events organised by trade unions, employer bodies, public bodies, educational institutions and civic society groups throughout the country.  In 2010, NERA will provide workshops throughout the country where employers and employees can meet NERA staff in an informal setting with a view to getting information relevant to their particular circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1777">NERA also liaises with a number of organisations, including the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland (MRCI), which deal directly and closely with migrant workers.  It has also appointed a member of its management team to liaise with the MRCI on matters of common interest and to maintain open communications between the organizations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">NERA is committed to ensuring that workers from overseas have access to Employment Rights information.  Of the 69 NERA Inspectors currently employed, 9 have specific language skills in Polish, Slovakian, Lithuanian and Russian. NERA also draws on interpretative service providers for other languages as required.  An information brochure is available in 12 different languages including Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian, Chinese and French.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">Power to enter private dwellings</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">There are considerable protections in the constitution to protect the privacy of personal dwellings.  However, NERA Inspectors can enter a private home with the consent of the occupier.  It can also, apply to the District Court for a warrant to enter a private home to examine records.  Such warrants may only be issued if a judge of the District Court is fully satisfied that the application is valid in all respects and is based on the sworn information of an Inspector that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that information required by an Inspector is held on any premises or any part of premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">NERA uses information available from a number of sources, including the employment permits database, to identify potential employers of domestic employees.  It will also investigate any complaints of suspected breaches of employment legislation received.  I would encourage anyone who believes that their employment rights are being infringed to contact NERA as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_1796">The gender pay gap (defined as the difference between men's and women's average gross hourly earnings as a percentage of men's average gross hourly earnings) was estimated by EUROSTAT in 2007 at 17.6% on average in the EU.  It exceeded 25% in two countries (Estonia and Austria) and 20% in seven countries (Slovakia, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Germany, the United Kingdom and Greece).  The gender pay gap in Ireland was estimated at 17.1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1797">A significant body of legislation has been developed at national level to combat discrimination and guarantee equal treatment.  In addition, a large number of non-legislative measures and initiatives have helped to promote equality between women and men in all areas.

Overall coordination of the National Women's Strategy is led by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_1800">The introduction of the Employment Permits Act 2006 entailed a radical overhaul of the administrative arrangements and work practices of the Employment Permits Section.  Employment permits are now issued on the basis of different permit types with dedicated staff trained in decision making on specific types.  This system has streamlined the work of the section allowing faster times for issuing and maximising use of resources.  During 2008, fully completed applications for all employment permit types were processed within our customer service target of 15 working days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1801">Due to the prioritisation of business needs of my Department, it was necessary to re-deploy a number of staff in the Employment Permits Section to the Redundancy Payments area in early 2009 where there is a strong need for additional resources to process payments to those who have lost their jobs.  This has resulted in currently higher processing times for some of the permit types.  In the priority high-skills area of green cards and intra-company transfers, applications are still being processed within 15 working days.  In relation to Work Permits and Spousal applications, measures have been put in place to address the current waiting-time.  I can report that significant progress has been made in reducing the backlog in these areas and we will continue to seek further improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1802">The Employment Permits Section is also currently developing a back office IT system to reduce the administrative burden on all applicants for Employment Permits and to further streamline the process.  This system is forecast to go live in September 2010.  As a result, a number of documents currently required with each application (as set down in the Employment Permits Act 2006) will be directly verified with the appropriate authority avoiding the need for paper submission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">In addition, the former Minister, An Tánaiste Mary Coughlan TD, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, announced on the 28th August 2009 that it will not be necessary for those who have been working lawfully and who have held an employment permit for 5 consecutive years to have an employment permit to remain in employment.  On presentation of the relevant documentation to the Immigration Authorities they will now be facilitated with the appropriate endorsement.  This has streamlined the process for all concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1805">One of the high level goals set out in the recently launched IDA strategy document, entitled "Horizon 2020", is that, in the period 2010 to 2014, 50% of FDI projects will be located outside of Dublin and Cork.  Building on existing regional strengths to ensure Ireland's economic development and optimising regional spread in overseas investments is central to IDA's core activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1806">This initiative supports national policy as outlined in the National Spatial Strategy (NSS), the aim of which is to achieve a balance of social and economic development across the country.  In particular the NSS focuses on the presentation of areas of sufficient scale and critical mass as national regional gateways and hubs.  In this context the Gateways of Sligo, Letterkenny and Dundalk will be the major targets for investment in the Border counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1807">However, the challenge in achieving an even spread of investment across the country is intensified as the sophistication of investments increase.  These investments require a concentration of highly qualified and educated workers, supporting infrastructure and high level business services.  Frequently, competition for Foreign Direct Investment comes from city regions with populations in excess of one million people.  Dublin is the only recognised city region of scale in Ireland.  If FDI is to continue to contribute to balanced regional development the other regions of the country must be promoted as regions of scale with urban centres that provide the range of infrastructure and services that high value investment projects demand.  IDA continues to vigorously promote such regions to potential investors.  Meanwhile, we must not forget that there are 71 IDA supported companies employing a total of 7,887 people in the Border region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1808">The implementation of the Good Friday Agreement has resulted in the creation of opportunities for the attraction and development of foreign direct investment to the Border region and there is a wide range of cross-Border activities aimed at economic development.

        <b>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</b>
         his views on the recent number of cases highlighted by the National Consumer Agency in which some branches of the country’s four biggest retailers were charging customers more than the prices displayed; if he is satisfied that the law is adequate to deal with such practices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1811">Consumer protection law obliges traders offering a product for sale to indicate the selling price and the unit price of that product and to ensure that the indication of the selling price and of the unit price is clearly visible. Complaints in relation to products being offered for sale where the price or unit price is not clearly visible should be brought to the attention of the National Consumer Agency who have responsibility for enforcing consumer law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">Insofar as instances where a wrong indication of price is concerned, traders who provide false information in relation to the price of a product may be engaging in a misleading commercial practice and may, therefore, be committing an offence under consumer law. Again instances of such practices should be referred to the National Consumer Agency in order that they can be investigated.  I understand that the cases referred to by the Deputy follow on from concerted enforcement activity by the Agency in this area in the course of the latter half of 2009. Arising from this activity, the Agency took a total of 62 enforcement actions, including 19 compliance notices issued to traders who charged more for consumer goods than the price displayed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">I fully support the Agency's actions in ensuring that consumers are provided with accurate information regarding products and services and that they are not exposed to unfair or misleading commercial practices.  I am satisfied that the law provides strong protections against traders who would seek to mislead consumers through the provision of false information, such as by the wrong indication of prices.</p>

            <p eId="para_1815">Responsibility for education and training services rests with the Department of Education and Skills.  In response to the announcement of redundancies in the company, I established an inter-agency team comprising Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the relevant County Enterprise Boards, FÁS, the Department of Social Protection together with my own Departmental officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">The primary focus of the Inter Agency team will be to support the affected employees, to explore their options regarding employment, self employment through setting up a new business, skills development and to outline the supports available to them.  Dedicated information centres staffed by the agencies are being established on site in Cavan, Navan and Blanchardstown to support the affected workers.  Staff briefing sessions will also be held in these centres together with a series of business start-up workshops for those thinking of starting a business.  Enterprise Ireland is in ongoing communication with the company concerned regarding the most appropriate and practical support measures that can be provided by the agencies concerned, while also ensuring continuation of normal business at the locations affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will also assist in marketing the skills and capabilities of staff to potential investors in Ireland and overseas in the drive to replace jobs as soon as possible.  The County and City Enterprise Boards in the Meath, Cavan and Fingal areas are working together to provide an appropriate co-ordinated response to the announcement of the job losses.  The Boards will endeavour to provide every support possible for those directly affected who wish to establish a business or to explore the possibilities of self-employment.  I consider that the inter-agency team is best placed to coordinate the activities of the relevant Government Departments, state development agencies and the County Enterprise Boards, to ensure support for employment opportunities in the region affected.</p>

            <p eId="para_1819">The consultation paper recently published by the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator relates specifically to financial institutions and insurance undertakings.  Policy responsibility for the financial sector rests with my colleague the Minister for Finance.  For my part, I welcome the publication of the consultation paper. I understand this initiative is part of a wider strategy to update the domestic regulatory framework applying to credit institutions and insurance undertakings and that the Regulator plans to develop corporate governance frameworks for other sectors of the financial services industry such as funds and credit unions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">The Financial Regulator envisages that while the new rules should apply to all credit institutions and insurance undertakings, he has not adopted a one-size-fits-all approach.  I welcome the Regulator's openness to implementing the rules proportionately, where appropriate, and to recognise institutions with a lesser economic significance and lower risk activities.  Interested parties are asked to comment on the proposals by end June 2010 and I look forward to seeing the new corporate governance standards published by the Regulator in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_1822">The Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 prohibits grocery goods undertakings from engaging in anti-competitive conduct.  Specifically undertakings are prohibited from compelling another undertaking to make any payment or grant any allowance for the advertising or display of goods. The Act also places specific prohibitions on retailers from compelling suppliers to make payments for providing space for grocery goods within a newly opened premises/part of a premises within the first 60 days of opening of the new premises. The Act requires that in order for these practices to be considered as prohibited practices they must have as their object the prevention/restriction/distortion of competition.  The Act provides that persons aggrieved by prohibited practices have a right of action before the Circuit or High Court. A similar right of action is granted to the Competition Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">Deputies and any other parties who have evidence of retailers demanding "hello money", "pay to play money" or other like practices should bring such evidence to the attention of the Competition Authority in order that it can be investigated.  The Competition Authority is committed to investigating any anti-competitive practices as thoroughly and as expeditiously as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">With regards to the relationship between retailers and suppliers, the Deputy will be aware that the Renewed Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to "implement a Code of Practice for doing business in the Grocery Goods sector to develop a fair trading relationship between retailers and their suppliers" and "to review progress of the Code and if necessary to put in place a mandatory code".  The Government will give effect to this commitment by including a specific provision in the legislation, currently being prepared to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of statutory Codes of Conduct in the grocery goods sector. I expect to publish this legislation later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">In the interim period, until the legislation is enacted, the opportunity will be taken to explore with all the relevant stakeholders the possibilities of agreeing a Voluntary Code, which would respect the interests of all parties.  A Voluntary Code offers stakeholders the opportunity to develop a Code most suited to the dynamics of the Irish grocery goods sector and which could also form the basis of any subsequent statutory Code.  I have appointed John Travers as facilitator, to engage with stakeholders in relation to the drawing up of a voluntary code.</p>

            <p eId="para_3188">The Live Register series gives a monthly breakdown of the number of people claiming Jobseekers Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance and other registrants as registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Figures are published for each county and local social welfare office.  The following table contains monthly Live Register information for persons aged under 25, 25 years and over and total persons in each county in September 2007 and December 2007. It should be noted that the Live Register is not a definitive measure of unemployment as it includes part-time workers, and seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance.

        <b>Deputy Arthur Morgan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</b>
         the general level of compliance with the 15-day payment rule throughout Departments; the amount of late payment interest that has been incurred across all Departments in respect of non-payment within these 15 days since it came into effect in June 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3774">In accordance with the Government Decision of 19 May 2009 all central Government Departments are required to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice.</p>
            <p eId="para_3775">Departments are also required to report quarterly to my Department on their performance in meeting this target. The first returns by Departments covered the period 15 June to 30 September 2009 and were published on 30 December 2009. The second set of returns for the last quarter of 2009, was published on 5 March 2010. The third set of returns for the first quarter of 2010, is available from today on my Department's website under the "Small and Medium Enterprises Publications" link.</p>
            <p eId="para_3776">The ongoing publication of these composite returns by my Department provides clarity in relation to the performance of individual Departments in meeting the terms of the Government Decision.  While there is some variation between the performance of individual Departments and fluctuations within Departments across the three quarters, overall performance has been positive.</p>
            <p eId="para_3777">In relation to the first quarter of 2010, the returns show that:</p>
            <p eId="para_3778">In value terms, Departments paid 96.7% of invoices within 15 days compared with 97.9% for Q4 figures and 97.8% for Q3.</p>
            <p eId="para_3779">10 Departments were paying in excess of 90% of invoices by value within 15 days;</p>
            <p eId="para_3780">4 Departments were paying in excess of 80% of invoices by value within 15 days and</p>
            <p eId="para_3781">1 Department had paid 79% of their invoices by value within 15 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_3782">Departments are playing their respective parts in assisting the cash flow of their suppliers, many of whom are Small and Medium Enterprises. The new procedures and processes introduced are having an impact in assisting Irish SMEs cash flow in the current difficult economic environment and this development must be welcomed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3783">It is the responsibility of each Department to meet its obligations under the terms of the Government Decision. Any businesses that experience difficulties in receiving payment on foot of valid invoices within 15 days should contact the contracting Department to resolve their difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3784">The above arrangements operate on an administrative basis and do not alter the contractual relationship between Government Departments and their suppliers or the current late payments legislation.  Therefore, no penalty interest applies in cases where payments are made outside the 15 day administrative period but within the normal 30 day period.</p>

            <p eId="para_3841">I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 100 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3842">The High Level Group on Business Regulation was set up in 2007 to provide a forum for dialogue between business and Government.  Its objective is to find ways to reduce administrative burdens on business arising from regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3843">The Group acts as a clearing house for specific red tape issues raised by business, and engages with the relevant Government Departments and Agencies in seeking solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3844">I am well aware that the burden of regulation falls disproportionately on SMEs.  Even though they may have small numbers of staff, they have to comply with much of the same regulation as larger firms, and deal with much the same level of paperwork. It is for this reason that the work of the High Level Group is essential to improving the cost base of SMEs in Ireland.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the interests of SMEs are to the forefront of the High Level Group's agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_3845">On 11 May 2010 my colleague Minister Kelleher launched a series of workshops which are aimed at finding ways to reduce burdens on business including SMEs.  These workshops will look at simplifying the burden on business in the area of Company Law, Employment Law and Health and Safety Law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3846">I would encourage businesses and their representative organisations to participate as fully as possible in these events so that we can work together to drive down the cost of red tape by the targeted 25%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3847">The High Level Group reported to Government on its first year's work in July 2008.  Its report is available on the Department's website. I propose to submit the second report of the Group to Government shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_3849">Hotels in the Dublin, Cork and Dun Laoghaire municipal areas are subject to the National Minimum Wage Act. In the rest of the country accommodation providers are covered by the rates of pay and terms and conditions set out in the Hotels Employment Regulation Order which provides for minimum rates of pay that are normally in excess of the national minimum hourly wage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3850">The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) carried out a total of 131 inspections in the hotels sector under the Hotels Employment Regulation Order during 2009 and found 96 to be non-compliant, a breach rate of 73%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3851">In 2009 NERA made a total of 2,981 inspections under National Minimum Wage Act and 200 breaches or a 7% breach rate was discovered. NERA's existing management information system does not allow this global National Minimum Wage figure to be further broken down on a sectoral basis. It is not possible, therefore, to identify the number of breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act that specifically relate to the providers of accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_4094">The National Competitiveness Council (NCC) monitors our competitiveness and publishes an annual report "Benchmarking Ireland's Progress".  Many of the issues which have been identified by the NCC have been addressed, such as improving productivity, action on energy prices and increasing competition in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4095">Since January 2008, Ireland has regained competitiveness as domestic inflation remains below that of our main trading partners and the euro weakened — in February 2010, Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (HCI) was back to its January 2005 position.</p>
            <p eId="para_4096">Improving our relative cost competitiveness requires the cost of doing business in Ireland to fall relative to that of our trading partners.  Data which will be published shortly by the NCC will show that prices in Ireland have moderated in the past year, particularly property and energy prices.  In addition, at an economy wide level, Irish labour wage rates — when adjusted for productivity — are becoming more cost competitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_4097">In parallel to the fundamental steps taken over the past 18 months to stabilise the public finances and restore the banking system, the necessary price adjustment to restore competitiveness is underway.  Business costs have fallen: wage bills, asset prices, energy and prices in general have responded to the effects of recession and corrective government action.</p>
            <p eId="para_4098">Further strengthening Ireland's competitive position will foster economic growth.  I am working with my colleagues in Government to further embed the improvements already achieved and to strengthen Ireland's relative international competitiveness position.</p>

            <p eId="para_4100">As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, I am directly accountable to the Oireachtas for the activities of my Department and my Department's own expenditure decisions.  In that regard, together with the Ministers of State assigned to the Department, I answer Parliamentary Questions, Adjournment Debates, etc, on our Departmental policies and strategies.  I also present my Department's Annual Output Statement to the relevant Joint Committee each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4101">Consistent with the duties and responsibilities assigned under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts and the Public Service Management Act, the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer and appears before the Public Accounts Committee to answer questions on the detail of the Department's expenditures.  Furthermore, those expenditures are examined each year by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who publishes his findings, and whose report informs the annual PAC consideration of the Department's Appropriation Account. In addition, a number of Agencies operate under the aegis of my Department in supporting the development and delivery of our policy interventions and supports.  The roles and responsibilities of these Agencies are set out in their establishment legislation, as amended from time to time.  The chief officer of each Agency, and the chairman of each Agency Board, is directly accountable to the Oireachtas through our Committee system where they can be called to account for individual elements of Agency expenditures.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to answer for the day-to-day decisions and expenditures of the individual Agencies when Oireachtas members have such a direct facility to call to account the Heads of each Agency in relation to their stewardship of the Agency and the day-to-day expenditure decisions they take.</p>
            <p eId="para_4102">I believe that these systems, which are well-established over a long period of time, operate in an manner that strikes the appropriate balance between the principle of democratic accountability by me as Minister and the demands on the Agencies to perform efficiently and effectively the functions for which they were established in their own right.  They ensure that the Oireachtas can accesses all pertinent information on "day to day expenditure" directly from those who are immediately responsible for taking such decisions, while also holding Ministers directly accountable for overall policy decision or directions.</p>

            <p eId="para_4104">Future sustainable economic growth will be based on a thriving Irish export sector characterised by innovative companies.  Exports are critical both to maintaining current jobs and driving future job creation.  The Government, with the assistance of Enterprise Ireland, has worked hard, not just to ensure companies survive the recession, but also to position them so they can seize the export opportunities that the tentative recovery in major economies will present.</p>
            <p eId="para_4105">To this end, the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund was announced by Government in April 2009.  By the end of April this year, 197 projects from 193 companies had been approved a total of €72m. 1,696 companies were supported under the Government's Employment Subsidy Scheme<b> </b>and a total of €133.5 million towards 15,272 subsidies has been approved to these companies.  The companies in turn have committed to maintain 103,977 jobs to the end of November this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4106">Enterprise Ireland continues to work with companies in overseas markets both to consolidate their business and help them seize new opportunities in the Eurozone and growth markets such as China.  In addition, the agency is driving in-company R&amp;D projects, typically focused on near-to-market development.  Such innovation will focus on driving "new to firm" and "new to market" products and services which will drive the attainment of exports as global markets recover.  This in turn will lead to job growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_4107">Manufacturing is the bedrock on which the growth in Ireland's FDI was founded.  Historically, it has been a significant segment of investment and it will continue to remain so into the future. The Hi-Tech manufacturing sector will be characterised by increased international competition and enhanced output volumes due to investments in technology and automation. Globally, manufacturing jobs, as a percentage of total employment, will continue to decrease even in lower cost locations.  Mirroring the rest of our economy, manufacturing is also in transition.  Higher technological investment and higher value products will be the hallmark of future manufacturing operations in Ireland. These operations will be knowledge, capital and skills intensive characterised by a participative innovative culture where management and staff continuously collaborate to drive innovation, productivity, agility, learning and adaptability.</p>
            <p eId="para_4108">In order to accelerate these changes, IDA Ireland, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, is supporting an industry consortium approach on a range of applied research initiatives under the new Competence Centre programme envisaged in the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation (SSTI).  A broad range of topics is being evaluated for potential funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_4109">Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology continue to offer the best opportunities for new name and existing manufacturing investments because of the need to protect Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), meet regulatory requirements, the capital intensity of facilities, the relative high value and profitability of products, and high level skill sets.  This when combined with Ireland's tax regime, track record in large scale facility construction and operation and the relevant skill base makes for a competitive value proposition.</p>
            <p eId="para_4110">Despite difficult economic times, it is important to recognise that Ireland continues to develop into a "<i>Smart Economy</i>”. Within this ambition, foreign owned companies play a hugely significant role. They remain a critical element in portraying Ireland as a leading international location for innovation and investment and this is endorsed by their continuing commitment to invest in Ireland during the economic downturn. While it is clear that we are operating in a very difficult economic environment, there are still investment opportunities in global markets and IDA will continue to compete vigorously for projects for Ireland.  To date in 2010 there have been 29 IDA Announcements with the potential to create in excess of 1,600 jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4112">Details of jobs, including jobs lost, in agency-assisted companies in Co. Kildare between 2000 and 2009, are set out in the table.  As this data is compiled on an annualised basis, figures in respect of 2010 will not be available until early in 2011. It is not possible to audit the extent to which job losses in the economy arise due to firms relocating abroad.  Information received by the enterprise development agencies from client companies which have closed plants or downsized their workforces suggests that job losses have been attributable to a range of factors including loss of contracts or a drop in demand for products, restructuring and rationalisation within companies and relocation of operations abroad.  For those firms who relocate activities abroad, there are many factors that can influence this decision.  For example, firms adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology, business takeovers and consolidations.  The result is flows of investment and employment across borders.</p>
            <p eId="para_4113">The relocation of businesses within particular types of industry is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland.  We successfully manage this process, through our policies on enterprise and foreign direct investment.  These policies have enabled us to win many prestigious and value added investments.  New jobs created in the enterprise development agencies' client companies in the last number of years are heavily concentrated in high-value added, knowledge-based companies that offer greater security in the face of intense international competition.  To support this strategy, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are working closely with educational institutions in the County, to foster links with industry and in developing the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to Kildare.  The agencies are also working with FÁS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.</p>
            <p eId="para_4114">Since the beginning of 2007, Enterprise Ireland has approved over €20m in support to companies in Kildare to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets.</p>

            <p eId="para_4231">The core policies and measures which underpin the Government's drive to grow exports and create sustainable jobs are outlined in the Government's "Jobs and Growth 2010" Statement, which was published in March.  It is clear from this Policy Statement that the delivery of jobs and economic growth requires both direct and indirect measures.  We have made sure, first of all, that the business and employment environment is favourable and is conducive to growth. Secondly, we have taken steps in the last 12-18 months to safeguard business and jobs through the difficult period of adjustment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4232">The Government has implemented a comprehensive economic strategy that includes prudent and controlled levels of taxation, spending and borrowing.  It also has at its heart policies targeted at new, sustained growth in business, exports and jobs, based on increasing levels of productivity, competitiveness and innovation.  These are the policies that are firmly at the top of my agenda as the new Minister for Enterprise, Trade &amp; Innovation, and I believe that these policies will continue to show results.</p>
            <p eId="para_4233">Competitiveness is complex and involves many factors. As well as consumer prices, labour and other business costs, productivity-enhancing investment in key areas such as infrastructure is vital.  In Government, we are conscious that further improvement in Ireland's competitive position will support business and foster economic growth. By maximising our resources, our job is to provide a suitable framework that will encourage enterprise development and opportunities, including job creation throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4234">Since January 2008, Ireland has regained competitiveness as domestic inflation remains below that of our main trading partners and the euro weakened — in February 2010, Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (HCI) was back to its January 2005 position.</p>
            <p eId="para_4235">Improving our relative cost competitiveness requires the cost of doing business in Ireland to fall relative to that of our trading partners.  Data which will be published shortly by the NCC will show that prices in Ireland have moderated in the past year, particularly property and energy prices.  In addition, at an economy wide level, Irish labour wage rates — when adjusted for productivity — are becoming more cost competitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_4236">In parallel to the fundamental steps taken over the past 18 months to stabilise the public finances and restore the banking system, the necessary price adjustment to restore competitiveness is underway.  Business costs have fallen: wage bills, asset prices, energy and prices in general have responded to the effects of recession and corrective Government action.  We are targeting R&amp;D and Innovation to drive productivity and ensure that we have the skills and technologies available in Ireland that will give us a competitive advantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_4237">Recent changes in Departmental structures have brought innovation to the fore in my new Department.  I am pleased to advise the House that the Government has agreed that I personally chair a High Level Implementation Committee to oversee implementation of the Report of the Innovation Taskforce, which was also published in March. This reflects the highest political priority that is being afforded to the implementation of this report.</p>
            <p eId="para_4238">Further strengthening Ireland's competitive position will foster economic growth and bring an increase in job creation throughout the country.  I am working with my colleagues in Government to further embed the improvements already achieved and to strengthen Ireland's relative international competitiveness position.</p>

            <p eId="para_4240">It is not possible to audit the extent to which job losses in the economy arise due to firms relocating abroad.  Information received by the enterprise development agencies from client companies which have closed plants or downsized their workforces suggests that job losses have been attributable to a range of factors including loss of contracts or a drop in demand for products, restructuring and rationalisation within companies and relocation of operations abroad.  For those firms which relocate activities abroad, there are many factors that can influence this decision.  For example, firms adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology, business takeovers and consolidations.  The result is flows of investment and employment across borders.</p>
            <p eId="para_4241">The relocation of businesses within particular types of industry is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland.  We successfully manage this process, through our policies on enterprise and foreign direct investment.  These policies have enabled us to win many prestigious and value added investments, and have enabled us to replace lost jobs with others of equal or higher value in the economy. New jobs created in the enterprise development agencies' client companies in the last number of years are heavily concentrated in high-value added, knowledge-based companies that offer greater security in the face of intense international competition.  In addition we continue to focus on strengthening our international competitiveness.  Price competitiveness is also a factor in investment decisions and we have made progress in ensuring that the necessary price adjustments are underway.  Unit labour costs, energy costs and prices in general are falling.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation" eId="spk_741">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_4243">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4244">I wish to advise the Deputy that while a lump sum claim was submitted to the Department in this instance, the claim is being returned as the required supporting documentation has not been lodged.  It is my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  The documentation required in support of lump sum claims, such as in this instance, is set out on my Department's website <i>www.deti.ie</i>.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50’s) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_4245">The documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.  If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_4246">If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</p>

            <p eId="para_4251">I have no plans to abolish VRT.  In that regard it must be recognised that in Ireland VRT is an important source of revenue for the Exchequer; for example yielding around €1.3bn in 2006, €1.4bn in 2007 and €1.1bn in 2008.  The receipts for 2009 at €375 million reflected the contraction in economic activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_4252">As the Deputy will be aware, it would not be possible to abolish VRT without raising the equivalent amount of money from other sources.  The possibility of introducing widespread road pricing has at times been mentioned; however, any such measure is realistically still some way off.  Increasing excise on petrol and auto-diesel has also been put forward.  Abolishing VRT and collecting the same amount of revenue, that would have been raised in a normal year, from another source would, for example, require an excise, inclusive of VAT, increase on both petrol and auto-diesel of 25 to 30 cent per litre.  There is no evidence that such measures would be any more agreeable to the public than VRT is, and indeed each bring their own, if different, set of problems and difficulties.</p>

            <p eId="para_4254">The Banknote Recycling Framework (BRF) was adopted by the ECB in 2005, with a deadline of end 2007 for full implementation.  It laid down a standard for the authenticity and quality of banknotes to be issued to the public and rules for the sorting of banknotes to be issued via ATMs and over the counter by credit institutions and professional cash handlers.  Ireland and several other Eurozone countries applied for and were granted an extension of the implementation deadline until end 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4255">The Central Bank of Ireland has been working with the commercial banks and with other professional cash handlers since 2006 to implement the BRF by the deadline of end 2010.  The BRF did not require transposing legislation in Ireland and is being implemented by means of formal written agreements between the Central Bank, the commercial banks and other stakeholders including Credit Unions, an Post, Bureaux de Change and Cash in Transit Companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_5046">As a result of a re-organisation at Principal level in my Department in November last year, following a number of retirements from key posts in the Department, I sanctioned the filling of 4 Principal level posts through internal promotion, as we had a number of unsuccessful attempts to have them filled through redeployment from elsewhere in the civil service.  The number of agreed Principal level posts has been reduced to 52, and the number currently serving is below that.  Overall, numbers across all grades within my Department have fallen from 608.61 at the date the moratorium was announced (27 March 2009), to 551.88 today.</p>
            <p eId="para_5047">Revenue</p>
            <p eId="para_5048">Last December I sanctioned the filling of up to 200 posts across all grade levels in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in recognition of the importance of the Office's role and the significant reduction in its staff numbers during 2009.  The filling of these posts is within the numbers ceiling set for the Revenue Commissioners under the Employment Control Framework and salary costs will be met from within the agreed administrative budget.  These posts are being filled through a combination of redeployment, promotion and open recruitment.  To-date 24 staff have being redeployed from other Departments, 8 internal promotions have taken place and a total of 15 staff has been recruited by way of open competitions.  One higher duty allowance was awarded to cover the vacant position of Head Service Officer and 77 enforcement allowance posts have been filled to maintain the complement of staff in this critical area of Revenue's business.</p>
            <p eId="para_5049">In addition, as part of the final phases of agreements with staff unions in the context of the restructuring of Revenue and the restructuring of Information and Communications Technology over the period 2003 to 2007, Revenue made a further 42 internal promotions since the introduction of the moratorium.</p>
            <p eId="para_5050">Valuation Office</p>
            <p eId="para_5051">Four of the promotions were for Technical staff involved in GIS work and had been negotiated prior to the Moratorium.  They formed part of an agreed package for modernisation and change in the organisation which includes staffing cuts.  The cost benefit to the organisation is substantial over the next ten years.  One promotion was a replacement for a retiree to a position, the filling of which was vital to ensuring that statutory deadlines were met.</p>
            <p eId="para_5052">18 Higher Duty Allowance posts were converted to substantive posts in October 2009 to reflect the ongoing nature of the Revaluation project.  These conversions related to posts which had been filled on an allowance basis for up to five years and the promotions were cost neutral to the exchequer.</p>

For the years 2008 and 2009 they are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2007, adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends in the interim.

Food Business Operators are responsible for producing safe food and labelling safe food in compliance with food safety legislation.  The FSAI in conjunction with its official agencies carries out official controls in retail butcher shops and supermarkets to ensure chicken fillets are labelled in accordance with the law and to ensure the consumer is fully informed about the product they are buying and are not misled.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_5222">I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 to 146, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5223">On 12 April last I was pleased to announce details of a dedicated  youth café funding scheme of €1.5m from dormant accounts funds. This is the first dedicated youth café funding scheme in Ireland and was launched along with the publication of two relevant associated publications: ‘‘Youth Cafés in Ireland: A best practice guide" and Youth Café Toolkit: how to set up and run a youth Café in Ireland". These developments respond to the repeated emphasis young people have placed on the need for such recreational spaces. They recognise the achievements already made by many groups in establishing youth cafés around the country and ensure a solid policy foundation for youth café development and the expansion of safe quality recreational spaces for young people. I wish to confirm to the deputy that the funding is once off in nature and that  the drawdown of funds from this scheme will take place over the present and next year (2011).</p>
            <p eId="para_5224">The youth café funding scheme is being administered by POBAL on behalf of my office through a closed call via the nationwide network of city and county development boards (CDBs). The Youth Café model is based on a multi-agency approach and the County Development Board structure provides the natural fit for the assessment of local need, priorities and sustainability from multi agency perspectives.  The use of the CDB network in the application process will also enable direct local involvement in the initial prioritisation of applications. This will ensure that detailed local knowledge is taken into account in the shortlisting of applications for further consideration by POBAL.</p>
            <p eId="para_5225">The Scheme (based on the key principles contained in the youth café guide and toolkit) is designed to ensure that in the course of this process County Development Boards will be engaging with young people through the submission and selection process via the various consortia who may be applying. The Applicants rather than the County/City Development Boards are required to demonstrate that their organisations are engaging with young people and that their current operation is youth led.  The Deputy will be aware that this scheme and the policy itself evolved from previous consultations and research with young people in preparing the national recreation policy where the need for such spaces was felt to be of vital importance by young people themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_5226">While the objective of the young people's facilities and services fund (YPFSF), also administered by my office is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into facilities and activities that divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse, a number of facilities have been funded under the YPFSF which include a youth café element.  In 2009, the YPFSF Capital funding was given to the following projects:</p>
            <p eId="para_5227">The Apple Tree Foundation, Dundalk, Co Louth, €100,000 capital, €56,500 current;</p>
            <p eId="para_5228">The Gateway Project, Athlone, Co Westmeath, €85,045 capital, €20,000 current;</p>
            <p eId="para_5229">Francis Street Youth Café, Wexford Town, €85,000 capital, €50,000 current.</p>
            <p eId="para_5230">In 2009, the YPFSF also funded a youth centre in Arklow, Co Wicklow, that will have a Youth Café element: €270,000 capital and €59,000 current.  In 2009 once-off current funding of €80,500 was also allocated to the Northside Youth Café, Moyross, Limerick under this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5231">As the Deputy will be aware there are already a number of youth cafés in operation around the country.  Funding for these existing initiatives has often been provided through the local City/County Council and/or the Health Service Executive or other sources.  In addition the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs operates a number of relevant funding programmes aimed at supporting community development, locally based community and voluntary groups as well as programmes aimed specifically at supporting projects for disadvantaged youth.</p>
            <p eId="para_5232">The Scheme and its impact will be reviewed in due course. I will be examining opportunities for further support in the context of the fiscal situation in 2011 and thereafter.</p>

            <p eId="para_5385">The Fund is obliged as a matter of policy, to source at least 90% of treatment from the private hospital system.  The purchase of capacity from the public hospital system is to allow for activity in areas, such as paediatric surgery, which cannot be carried out in private hospitals, but this activity must not adversely affect core services.  In 2009, the NTPF sourced 6% of its activity from the public hospital system.</p>
            <p eId="para_5386">In addition to arranging inpatient care, the NTPF has conducted a number of out-patient initiatives including arranging diagnostic procedures.  The NTPF has such an arrangement in place with St Vincent's University Hospital for the referral of some public patients for radiology investigations.  These services are provided in a private clinic, in line with the Fund's general approach to the purchase of services for public patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_5390">I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5391">Children qualify for the scheme where they are aged more than 3 years and 2 months and less than 4 years and 7 months at 1 September each year.

            <p eId="para_5392">The scheme allows for exceptions to the upper age limit in situations where a child cannot start primary school until s/he is more than 5 years 6 months of age, due to either the enrolment policy of the local schools or having been assessed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) as being developmentally delayed or having a physical or sensory disability which prevents the child from availing of age-appropriate education.</p>

         if he will reply as per a commitment given to the Houses of the Oireachtas by his predecessor to the effect that Oireachtas Members would continue to receive replies to parliamentary questions whether specific commencement notice has issued to Kildare County Council or the National Roads Authority in respect of the road realignment at Carbury, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5407">The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993. Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5408">The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded is also a matter for the relevant local authority.  With regard to answering Parliamentary Questions, I assume the Deputy is referring to the agreement between my Department and the National Roads Authority.  From 1st September 2009, the National Roads Authority was tasked with undertaking the administration of the regional and local road grants on behalf of my Department.  This was done on foot of an agreement negotiated by officials of my Department and the NRA and approved by me and the Board of the Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_5409">The new arrangement was concluded on an administrative basis so as not to affect my statutory role or that of the local authorities in any way.  The NRA is not being given any new statutory powers similar to those it has in relation to national roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_5410">As a consequence, I indicated at that time, that because there is no change in my statutory role I would continue to reply to Parliamentary Questions on regional and local road grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_5411">On 22 April 2010, my Department wrote to Kildare County Council conveying approval to serve all outstanding "notices to treat" in respect of the R402 Edenderry to Enfield Road Improvement Scheme. Progression of this project is a matter for Kildare County Council.</p>

         if a Draft Protected Area Order was prepared in the 1950s by his Department regarding Dublin Airport; if so, the reason such an order was not promulgated in accordance with the wishes of the Houses of the Oireachtas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5415">The only Protected Area Order made under Section 14 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1950 in respect of Dublin Airport was the Air Navigation (Protection Area) Order 1988 (S.I. No. 284 of 1988). This Order created a protected area of 300 metres radius around the Doppler Very High Frequency Omni-Directional Radio Range and Distance Measuring Equipment sited at Rowlestown West in Co. Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_5416">The Order was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in November 1988 as required under Section 14(4) of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1950. The Act does not provide for the promulgation of such an Order in draft form.</p>
            <p eId="para_5417">The Deputy has enquired about the possible drafting of a Protected Area Order at some time in the 1950s. As the bulk of the records from this period are no longer in the custody of the Department of Transport I am not in a position to confirm if this matter was considered in the 1950s.</p>

            <p eId="para_5419">Statutory responsibility for securing the delivery of public transport infrastructure projects, such as the DART Underground and Metro North, is now a matter for the National Transport Authority (NTA), pursuant to section 11 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  The Dart Underground and Metro North continue to be the Government's top public transport investment priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5420">I understand the changes to the timetable for DART Underground mentioned by the Deputy relate to the finishing date for the project which will be later than anticipated as CIE have now been informed that the construction phase will take two years longer than originally estimated.</p>
            <p eId="para_5421">A second key consideration was that, based on experience with Metro North, it may take longer to complete the planning and statutory approval process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5422">In the light of these developments, my officials have asked the NTA for a full update on the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_5423">The Government remains committed to the earliest possible start up date and the speediest possible delivery of this project and will continue to pursue all available opportunities to shorten the delivery timescale. The most accurate forecast for a completion date is five and a half years from the commencement of construction.</p>
            <p eId="para_5424">The longer construction period for DART Underground has no implications for Metro North. The oral hearing before An Bord Pleanala on the railway order application for Metro North concluded in March this year.  A decision on the application is anticipated over the Summer.  In addition, two PPP consortia have been shortlisted under the PPP procurement process.  The next phase of procurement must await the outcome of the statutory approval process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5425">The European Investment Bank announced its approval to provide a loan of up to €500 million for Metro North. This decision is an important signal of confidence in this priority public transport project for Dublin.</p>

The matters raised in the report fall within the competence of a number of Departments and public bodies, including my Department, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Skills, the Revenue Commissioners and the Health Services Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5558">The report raises issues which my Department had recognised as important in developing rural transport and in making transport accessible, and these are already being progressed.  The Transport Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005, Transport for All, provides for the delivery of an accessible public transport system by 2015.  In addition, a number of initiatives are currently underway in the country exploring the potential for better integration of services between existing transport providers, which include Bus Éireann, Rural Transport Programme groups, the HSE, and the Irish Wheelchair Association.</p>

The status of the persons concerned remains largely as set out in that Reply. However, in the interim, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the second named person by her legal representative and lodged under cover letter dated 23 March 2009. In response to this application, a letter issued on 9 June 2009 advising that the person concerned was not automatically entitled to apply for Subsidiary Protection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicant was advised that she could seek the exercise of Ministerial discretion pursuant to Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 by making further representations identifying any new facts or circumstances which demonstrated a change of position from that at the time the Deportation Order was made on 5 August 2004. Representations were received on 23 July 2009 and are currently being considered.</p>

            <p eId="para_5629">From 2003-2008 the Remembrance Commission operated a Scheme of Acknowledgement, Remembrance and Assistance for Victims in this Jurisdiction of the Conflict in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_5630">Under the Scheme, payments could be made to individuals under various categories such as acknowledgement payments, economic hardship payments and medical expenses payments.  The Scheme also contained a provision to enable payments to be paid to groups offering support services to victims of the conflict.  Under this element of the Scheme payments were made to Justice for the Forgotten for the purpose of meeting the counselling and other needs of victims or their family members.  During the period of operation of the Scheme Justice for the Forgotten received a total of €1.2m of the €1.5m allocated for victim support services and was the only recipient of money under this heading. In addition the organisation had received over €890,000 from the Department of the Taoiseach in the period 2000-2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_5631">The term of appointment of the Remembrance Commission came to an end on 31 October 2008 and funding under the Scheme ended at that stage. Nevertheless, I took a decision at that time to grant further funding to Justice for the Forgotten totalling €190,300 to enable them to continue to operate while seeking to put alternative funding options in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_5632">Officials from my Department met with Justice for the Forgotten on a number of occassions and met with them again last June to apprise them of the situation and to confirm that my first priority, as I have stated, is to ensure that those victims who require ongoing medical treatment for injuries sustained in bombings and other incidents arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland will continue to be provided for.  I have made special arrangements to have these costs provided by my Department through the Victims of Crime Office.</p>

            <p eId="para_6205">Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health service executive payment.  The person concerned should contact the community welfare officer at her local health centre in order that she can have her claim for entitlements examined.</p>

         the number of persons on the live register in each area throughout Co. Kildare at present; the extent to which this has fluctuated over the past five years; the measures he has taken or proposes to take to address the issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_6207">The table at Appendix A sets out the number of persons on the Live Register in each local Department of Social Protection office in Co. Kildare at the end of April for each of the years 2005 to 2010. Year on year fluctuation by office at the end of April for each year during that period is also shown.</p>
            <p eId="para_6208">Income support for those who have lost their jobs is provided by my Department through Jobseeker's Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance. While the primary responsibility for job creation rests with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, my Department has a role in supporting people from welfare to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_6209">Apart from providing people with access to financial support after losing their jobs, it is important that as many people as possible are kept in work and that support is available to help people move from welfare back into employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6210">The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP), operated jointly with FÁS, is the main activation measure. Under the NEAP, everyone who is approaching three months on the live register is identified by the Department of Social Protection and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to assisting them enter/re-enter the labour market.  In the period January to end of December 2009, a total of 86,782 persons were referred to FÁS under NEAP, an increase of 26,522 (44%) over the same period in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6211">The Department also provides jobseekers with one-to-one assistance through its facilitator service. Facilitators work closely with FÁS and other agencies at a local level and help jobseekers develop individual progression plans to enhance their skills and ultimately improve their employment chances. From September 2008 to end of April 2010, facilitators dealt with over 32,000 cases under the Activation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6212">The Department operates a range of activation programmes and second chance education opportunities which assist unemployed people, and other social welfare recipients to improve their employability and personal and family situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6213">My Department will also, under the new role it has been given, including responsibility for the employment services of FÁS and schemes such as the Community Employment and Rural Social Schemes, be much more directly involved in providing new opportunities to those  who do not get full time employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_6214">The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is designed to allow the unemployed to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment, plus secondary benefits, over two years. At the end of March 2010, there were 5,137 people availing of the scheme. The Short Time Enterprise Allowance is payable to a person who qualifies for Jobseeker's Benefit and wishes to commence in self employment. This allowance is payable for the duration of their Jobseeker's Benefit entitlement. At the end of March 2010, there were 1,393 participants in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6215">The back to education allowance (BTEA) aims to give welfare recipients who left school early and those without third level qualifications a second chance to attain educational qualifications so as to reduce their risk of long term unemployment. The allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum personal rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the application for participation in the scheme. 20, 808 people were in receipt of BTEA at the end of December 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_6216">In addition, my Department, together with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Department of Education and Skills and FÁS supports the unemployed under a number of new measures. These include the Work Placement programme, the Short Time Work Training programme, the Back to College Initiative and the redundant apprentice programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6217">The Government is providing, through FÁS, a total of 147,000 training and activation places for jobseekers. In addition, there were 166,000 places available, including additional provision, education programmes in 2009, while the number of third level places has also increased drastically over the past ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_6218">The nature and structure of the supports provided by my Department to the people on the Live Register will continue to be monitored in the context of changes in the economic environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_6307">All procurements undertaken by the Department, including those outlined in the following table, comply with the terms of EU and national legislation and with the procedures set down by the Department of Finance.  For instance, all procurements in excess of €125,000 are advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU).  In accordance with Department of Finance rules, all IT related procurements valued in excess of €10,000 are advertised on the eTenders website.  For smaller procurements, the practice is to obtain at least 3 quotations.  The award of contracts without competitive tendering is only permitted in very exceptional circumstances (as defined in EU Directive 18/2004) and any such procurements that are in excess of €25,000 must be reviewed in advance by the Department's Internal Audit Unit and annual returns must be provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Department also participates in a range of joint initiatives of the National Procurement Service (OPW), including frameworks established for the purchase of IT equipment, such as PCs, printers etc. and central arrangements for the provision of human resource management and payroll management.</p>

It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.</p>

            <p eId="para_6383">The applications for child benefit and jobseeker's allowance, by the person concerned, were disallowed by a Deciding Officer of the Department in August 2007 and August 2008 (child benefit), April 2009 and February 2010 (jobseeker's allowance) as she was not habitually resident in the State for Social Welfare purposes.  I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that there is no trace of appeals against any of those decisions by the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_6384">In the normal course, an appeal against the decision of a Deciding Officer must be made within 21 days of a decision being notified.  Appeals received outside of this time limit may be accepted at the discretion of the Chief Appeals Officer.  This limit is not rigidly enforced but in view of the length of time which has elapsed since the person concerned was notified of each of these decisions and in the absence of any explanation for the failure to make the appeals within the prescribed time, it is considered that the acceptance of an appeal would not be warranted at this late stage.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister of Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</p>

            <p eId="para_6676">In April 2009 my Department commenced a review of the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, under which the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) operates.  The purpose of this review is to consider whether the Act best supports the PRTB's key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6677">As part of the review my Department engaged in a formal public consultation process, which took place from 29 May to 10 July 2009.  Arising out of this, submissions were received from a number of organisations, including landlord and tenant representative groups, social and voluntary bodies and residents' associations, together with individual submissions from landlords and tenants and from the staff and Board of the PRTB.  Following consideration of the submissions received during the consultation process, the preliminary outcomes of the review were announced in November 2009.  They include recommendations in a number of key areas, and have an overall emphasis on streamlining and simplifying the Act and reducing delays.  Among the main issues that will be addressed by the amending legislation are:</p>
            <p eId="para_6678">a statutory objective of 6 months to be set for the issuing of determination orders arising out of dispute resolution applications,</p>
            <p eId="para_6679">the Board of the PRTB to be reduced from 15 to 12 members,</p>
            <p eId="para_6680">the introduction of fixed fines where deposits are illegally retained by landlords,</p>
            <p eId="para_6681">measures to address non-payment of rent by tenants during a dispute process, in particular to introduce scope for the legal termination of such a tenancy,</p>
            <p eId="para_6682">the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board,</p>
            <p eId="para_6683">the inclusion within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act of segments of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel its current remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_6684">A number of issues requiring further research, including third party complaints under the Act, the Act's engagement with anti-social behaviour matters and how best to address issues surrounding the retention of deposits, will also be considered in detail.  The Department will continue to engage in direct consultation with key stakeholders so as best to address those issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_6685">The Government recently approved the preparation of Heads of a Bill in this regard and it is envisaged that the General Scheme of a Bill setting out the detailed proposals arising out of the review will be submitted for Government approval in autumn 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_6711">Meeting social housing need remains a high priority for the Government. While ensuring that we can deliver across the full range of needs, the scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_6712">I am determined to ensure that the programme is framed in a manner which continues to optimise the delivery of social housing.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions, and explore alternative solutions to address housing needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the Government's housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities <i>.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_6713">To this end, the range of delivery mechanisms continues to be adapted and expanded. For example, in 2009 I announced the introduction of a new Social Housing Leasing Initiative, through which it is expected that a substantial number of dwellings can be provided to meet housing needs, estimated at just over 56,000 households in the 2008 Housing Needs Assessment.  This, together with the Rental Accommodation Scheme, complements the traditional capital funded programmes operated through local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6714">I will be keeping the leasing initiative and all the other housing programmes under ongoing review to ensure that they are appropriately geared towards meeting the maximum level of housing need.</p>

I am aware that there have been recent incidents where some of these re-introduced birds have died as a result of eating poisoned meat-based bait.  I am very concerned at these incidents as not only do they impact negatively on our commitment to maintain and enhance Ireland's native wildlife but they also harm our environmental and agricultural reputation at home and abroad.</p>

While I recognise that the great majority of landowners and farmers are supportive of the raptor re-introduction project, and against the use of poison, it is necessary to continue to work to stop the few people who are continuing to use poison in this manner.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_6750">I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 and 232 to 235, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6751">The Government has set the targets for the contribution from renewable energy sources to electricity at 40% by 2020.  The 40% electricity target is consistent with the new EU target addressed to Ireland in the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC, which requires Ireland to increase the contribution from renewable sources to 16% of all energy consumed (encompassing electricity, transport and heating) by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_6752">Reflecting the need to support the development of biomass, I announced in February 2008 a Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) for biomass of 12 cent per kilowatt hour.</p>
            <p eId="para_6753">Under the auspices of the Renewable Energy Development Group, which is chaired by my Department, the Bioenergy Working Group is currently finalising a Bioenergy Road Map to 2020 which will underpin the contribution of bioenergy, including biomass to Ireland's Renewable Energy target for 2020.  The Working Group is reviewing the current REFIT for the various categories of biomass Combined Heat and Power plants, having regard to the particular challenges for the sector and I expect that work to be finalised within the next few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_6754">The Government's Energy Policy Framework 2007 sets out a target for co-firing in peat stations of 30% by 2015.  Both ESB and Bord na Móna have been conducting a programme of research and development, including large scale co-firing trials with a variety of materials.  The trials have also encompassed laboratory tests on the chemical and physical properties of various materials.</p>
            <p eId="para_6755">Decisions by ESB and Bord na Móna on what material to co-fire and the timing of the move to introduce large scale co-firing will be taken in light of the ongoing trials.</p>
            <p eId="para_6756">Both companies have been in discussions with a number of market players around sourcing potential supplies for the co-firing material.  The companies themselves will be responsible for making the commercial decisions to award any such contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_6757">The objective is to utilise domestically produced biomass as much as possible, and my Department is working closely with the Department of Agriculture to ensure that their support schemes for energy crops and forestry are in alignment with the scale of demand that may ultimately arise as a result of the co-firing process.</p>
            <p eId="para_6758">The Miscanthus Pilot Demonstration Programme is a newly launched programme funded under the Renewable Energy Research Development and Demonstration Programme, which provides assistance for the deployment of renewable heating systems fuelled by miscanthus in commercial, industrial, services and public sectors and also community organisations and Energy Supply Companies (ESCOs), in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_6759">The programme, which was launched on 30th April 2010, is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).</p>
            <p eId="para_6760">The use of miscanthus as a fuel to date is very limited in Ireland due to a number of issues, including limited experience with its use as a boiler fuel.  The Miscanthus Pilot Demonstration Programme is intended to support the establishment of a number of exemplar boiler sites, between five and 15 depending on the mix of size ranges and costs submitted.  These exemplar sites will serve to provide important information on the supply chain logistics and suitability of miscanthus as a boiler fuel in an Irish context, as well as providing a solid basis for creating market confidence.</p>

            <p eId="para_7057">The information requested by the Deputy in relation to enrolments in Post-Leaving Certificate (PLC) and population, broken down by county, is included by way of a table below.  Approval of PLC places involves incurring expenditure on teacher salaries, non-pay funding and means tested student support grants. Teachers are appointed to deliver PLC courses on the basis of a pupil teacher ratio of 17:1 compared to the 19:1 ratio that applies to second level teaching.  In addition, non pay funding related to student numbers is also provided.  Finally, students who satisfy the terms of the student support schemes are eligible to receive maintenance grants.  Taking all these factors into account it is estimated that approval for each additional 1,000 PLC places costs about €8 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_7201">I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding for an extension and refurbishment project.  The application has been assessed in accordance with published prioritisation criteria for large scale projects and assigned a band 2 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, are now available on the Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. </p>
            <p eId="para_7202">The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.  However, in view of the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression the project at this time.  The school has also submitted an application for funding for the replacement of Temporary Accommodation and has appealed the amount of funding approved for the Summer Works Scheme 2010.  These applications are currently under consideration by my Department and a response will issue to the school authority in due course.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_7206">Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre.  The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside.  However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for.  Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.  The Transport Liaison Officer of Co. Galway has advised that the pupil referred to in the details supplied is not attending a school in the catchment area in which he resides and therefore may only apply for catchment boundary transport subject to the terms outlined above.</p>

            <p eId="para_7302">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p>
